Introduction 
In the 2005 legislative session, Indiana’s elect ed officials saw the need for a comprehensive 
children's mental health plan and passed Senate Enrolled Act 529, which includes a chapter 
regarding children's mental health services.  The l egislation calls for the State of Indiana (with the 
Indiana Department of Education as the l ead agency) to complete three tasks:  
1) Develop a Children's Social, Emotional , and Behavioral Health Plan, containing 
short-term and long-term recommendations to provide comprehensive, coordinated mental health prevention, ea rly intervention, and treatment services 
for children from birth (0) through age 22;   
2) Adopt joint rules under IC 4-22-2, conc erning the children's social, emotional, and 
behavioral health plan; and 
3) Conduct hearings on the implementation of the plan before adopting joint rules under this   
chapter. 
An Interagency Task Force was formed with these goals in mind, and includes members 
from the Department of Education, Depart ment of Child Services, Department of 
Correction, Division of Mental Health and Addiction – Family and Social Services Administration, Medicaid – Family and Social Services Administration, Indiana State 
Department of Health, a parent advocate and the Governor's Office. Medicaid/State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) , the Indiana State Department of Health, 
the parent advocate and the Governor's Office, were not required by legislation but were added to the Interagency Task Force in order to provide a broader perspective.  
Indiana’s focus on mental health services follows President George W. Bush’s 2002 New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (called the Commission in this document) which was 
initiated to address the problems in the curr ent mental health service delivery system.  The 
President directed the Commission members to st udy the gaps and problems in the mental health 
system and make recommendations for improv ements to be implemented by the federal 
government, state governments, local agencies, and public and private health care providers.   
 
The Commission’s findings address unmet needs an d barriers that impede care for people with 
mental illnesses.  Mental illnesses are very comm on and affect the majority of American families.  
Mental illness can happen to a child, a co-worker, a brother, or a grandparent--someone from any 
background1.  Mental illness can also occur during any stage of life, childhood to old age.  
Communities, schools, and the workplace are all affe cted by mental illnesses.  It is important to 
note that whenever the terms child or children are used, it is understood t hat parents or guardians 
should be included in the process of making choices and decisions for minor children.  This 
allows the family to provide support and guidan ce when developing relationships with mental 
health professionals, community  resource representatives, teachers, and anyone else the 
individual or family invites.   
 
The Commission defined a serious emotional distur bance as “a mental, behavioral, or emotional 
disorder of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteria  specified in the DSM- III-R that results in 
functional impairment that substant ially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities in 
an individual up to 18 years of age.  The landm ark Surgeon General’s 1999 report on mental 
health found that nearly 14 million children—one in five—have a diagnosable mental disorder.  Half of this group lives with a disorder that is significantly impairing. One in 20, or approximately 5 percent of all children, has serious dysfunction
2. Serious mental illness is a term defined by

federal regulations that generally applies to mental  disorders which interfere with some area of 
social functioning.  The disorders range from mild to severe, and if left untreated—can be life-
limiting or crippling3. Yet most of these children, even thos e with the most severe impairments, do 
not receive care.  For those children who do not receive treatment, the repercussions can 
significantly impact the rest of their liv es: suicide, adverse affects on school 
performance, impaired relationships and incarceration.   In Indiana it is estimated there are 
857,854 youth aged 9-17 who have emotional difficult ies; of those youth, 31,639 may be eligible 
for public mental health services (200% of federal poverty level) ; 79% of those youth are 
currently being served (May, 2006). During the same time period, 6% of youth estimated to be in 
need of and eligible for public substance abuse treatment were receiving services4. 
Expectations and Outcomes of the Plan  
The Children’s Social, Emotional, and Behavioral Health Interagency Task force envisions a 
comprehensive, coordinated children’s mental heal th system comprised of prevention, early 
intervention, and treatment across all state systems (mental health, substance use, child welfare, 
juvenile justice, schools, Medicaid, and primary health care).  With gubernatorial, legislative, state 
and community support, this plan can make a differenc e.  Specifically, there are seven areas of 
expectations that the Indiana Department of Educat ion, the Department of Child Services, the 
Department of Correction, the Division of Mental  Health and Addiction, Medicaid and the Indiana 
State Department of Health have for this plan. 
 
1) Early Identification and Assessment 
• Participate in early identification init iatives (state agencies, community agencies, 
health care providers, child care providers, parents and schools).   
• Encourage parental involvement in noting early signs of possible need for 
assessment. 
• Establish one assessment for fair measur ement of preliminary information needed to 
help a child and improve the child’s situation. 
2) Accountability and Outcome Measurement 
• Evaluate the strengths and needs of Indi ana’s Behavioral Health network across 
child service agencies.  
• Establish of benchmarks to measure accountability of the system.   
• Determine outcomes for agency accountability. 
• Establish and operationalize common definitions.  
3) Best Practices 
• Reduce stigma as a barrier for help seeking behavior. 
• Improve the quality of services.  
• Make effective models of care available to all young people with mental health issues 
and/or substance use problems and their families.   
4) Finance and Budget 
• Communicate and collaborate between agencies to use dollars and resources wisely. 
• Fund services that produce positive outcomes. 
• Use state dollars to maximize federal dollars. 
• Address fiscal constraints. 
5) Obtaining Services and Referral Networks 
• Organize and coordinate service delivery models across systems.  
• Coordinate children’s mental health services at the state agency level. 
• Prevent duplication of services to those in need. 
• Families should have access to services and supports in a timely manner.

• Formulate a process for how to obtain services and recommend a referral network  by     
which children are treated fairly and equally  because of the process and not in spite 
of it. 
• Engage Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), Community Mental Health Centers 
(CMHCs), and providers in referral and delivery planning.   
• Increase public awareness of agencies’ services available.  
• Reduce stigma around mental health.  
6) Learning Standards 
• Increase focus on reviewing requirements and allowances in existing state education 
laws and make recommendations for change where appropriate.  
• Incorporate the social and emotional development of children as an integral 
component to the mission of schools.  
7) Workforce Development and Training 
• Build a qualified and adequately trained workforce with a sufficient number of 
professionals to meet the needs of children and families.  
• Increase the capacity of existing prog rams and providers who work with children.  
• Train frontline providers and make recommendations regarding appropriate training.  
• Strengthen parent education and support se rvices, especially for new and at-risk 
parents.  
Barriers to Mental Health Se rvice Provision for Children 
In most states and communities, si gnificant barriers to mental health  care services exist, including 
fragmentation of services, high service costs, insufficient resources including provider and 
workforce shortages and lack of availability of services, and stigma associated with mental 
illness.  Barriers to mental health care exist for all children with mental health needs and four out of five children do not receive needed mental health services
5.  Access to mental health services 
can be so inadequate that in some cases fam ilies are driven to place their children in child 
welfare or juvenile justice systems in order to obtain care for severe mental health needs.  For children and youth, fragmentation of services is compounded by the fact that this population is 
seen and served by multiple systems.  
 
There are a number of known risk factors  for developing emotional problems and disorders: 
biological factors (premature births, traumatic brai n injury, prenatal exposure to alcohol, tobacco 
and other drugs), family factors (resources, capacity, stresses), and parenting factors 
(responsiveness, sensitivity, and parental mental health)6. Poverty is known as an indirect risk 
factor because it can lead to behavioral problem s among parents, facilitate chronic stressful 
environments, and increase the risk of child abuse7.  
 
Identifying the emotional or behavioral problem or disorder can also be difficult.  Evidence suggests that pediatricians, usually the first non -family members to assess a child’s health, have 
an early opportunity to identify these children.  According to the Americ an Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP), there are a number of t ools that pediatricians can use to  identify childre n through age 
eight that can identify 70 to 80 percent of childr en with problems.  But an AAP study conducted in 
2003, found that only 15 percent of pedi atricians always use a screening tool
8.  In addition, some 
parents may not follow up on problems that are identified. One major study of primary care physicians found that 59 percent of children referred  to a mental health specialist never went for 
treatment

Of all sectors, schools play the largest role in serving youth with mental  and emotional disorders, 
ranging from mild to severe.  “For the majority  of children who received any mental health care, 
the education sector was the sole source of care,” Burns’ 1995 study concluded10.  While schools 
are by no means serving all children wi th mental disorders, they are a  prominent source of care 
for two reasons.  First, under the federal spec ial education law, schools are mandated to help 
children with emotional disturbance.  However, the special education criteria are narrow enough 
so that only those with the most serious dysfunc tion qualify.  The Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act of 2004 (IDEA) requi res that all school districts pr ovide a free appropriate public 
education (FAPE) to students with one or more of the 13 disabilities identified by the law and are 
thereby in need of special education services11. 
 
Second, over the last 20 years,  leaders have focused on the connection between emotional well-
being and school performance, and as political pres sure for academic achievement has mounted, 
there has been a striking growth in the number and variety of mental health services offered by 
schools for students with problems not severe enough to warrant, or qualify for, special 
education. These services are for students at ri sk for or diagnosed with mild to moderate 
disorders.  In some cases, funding can be used  for prevention programs  for the entire student 
body.  Although the special education system is ma ndated to serve children with serious mental 
disorders, they are frequently unidentified or mislabeled as learning disabled and miss the 
opportunity to receive care early on12.  For a review of the existing funding sources for mental 
health services for children in Indiana, please refer to Appendix A. 
Research on Barriers in Indiana 
Thomas Pavkov led the Indiana System of Care Assessment Project which assessed local systems of care within 92 Indiana counties for children and youth with serious emotional 
disturbances. Over 1,500 respondent s from five different stakehol der groups participated in the 
study: parent/family member/consumer, education, child welfare, juvenile justice, and mental 
health. The project survey assessed four areas including “problems encountered” or barriers to 
service, adequacy of service, qua lity of service, and system of ca re performance.  Analysis of 
participants’ responses indicated five “barrier” gr oupings in descending order of concern; barriers 
related to accessing services through the educational system, barriers related to accessing services in the community,  barriers to accessin g basic services,  barriers accessing restrictive 
treatment settings, and barriers accessing foster ca re.  Similarly, participants’ ratings related to 
service system performance indicated high levels  of concern about system performance issues 
related to strategic planning and collaboration along with service system performance issues that 
impede access to services. Based on these a nd other findings, Pavkov’s study suggests 
policymakers examine the following: systemic ba rriers encountered by parents in the educational 
setting and in the community; how state policies effe ct the provision of services to children with 
behavioral disorders within the classroom setti ng; and excessive use of punitive methods—
suspensions and expulsions—by schools
13.   
 
Barriers Identified by the Interagency Task Force 
In addition to these issues identified by Pavkov ’s study, the Interagency Task Force identified 
several barriers that exist in how mental health services are delivered in Indiana. 
1) Funding for mental health services is a barrier.  Funding sources are multiple and 
each has specific requirements for eligibility and services.   
• Medicaid and private insurance are the most common funding sources for children’s 
mental health services, yet not all children have access to these programs.  
• Different funding sources and different mandates for agencies cause duplication of 
services.

• Agencies have differing definitions for same concept for funding purposes; if the agency 
does not use their definition, they do not receive the funding. 
• Disparate funding sources exist and there are inconsistent, disparate budgets throughout 
counties. 
• In Indiana’s public mental health system in  State Fiscal Year 2005, 5% of all children 
served were uninsured, 79% were covered by  Medicaid, and 16% had some insurance at 
time of enrollment.  The benefits were not tracked. 
• Most private insurance has extremely lim ited mental health coverage and generally does 
not cover intensive, community-based services. 
• The Medicaid reimbursement rate has not increased in 12 years and many private 
resources refuse Medicaid.  
• The public mental health system (DMHA) allocates 10% of its budget for children.  The 
Hoosier Assurance Plan, which is a program of the FSSA/DMHA that helps eligible 
individuals who qualify for assistance pay for so me of their mental health treatment, is 
matched by local dollars through the Community  Mental Health Centers. An analysis of 
the state's 2003 budget showed that only 1% of funds spent for children were allocated 
for mental health services.  When Medicaid reimbursement was added, the total rose to 
7% of the children's budget. 
• During SFY 2003 1% of state expenditures related to children's services were allocated 
to community-based mental health; when Medicaid reimbursement was added, it became 
7% of the budget. 
• Funding drives the service delivery system, such as providing group services instead of 
individualized care.  Group services may be more appropriate in some instances; however the business plan was the impetus for some design features of the service 
delivery system. 
2) Coordination between agencies is a barrier.  Sharing information among providers is 
challenging because of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act  (FERPA ), distrust among 
agencies, and the complexity of the release of information processes.  
• Multiple agencies serve the same child. 
• Multiple agencies evaluate the same child. 
• The system is fragmented and difficult to navigate. 
• There is no systemic coordination to make sure the same or similar services exist from 
county to county.   
• Services offered/received are dep endent upon which system youths enter. 
• Assessment/treatment planning info rmation does not fo llow the child. 
• There is a lack of integrated treat ment of substance abuse/mental health. 
• Families reluctant to seek help because of concer ns of loss of custody. 
• Families are sometimes advised to seek t heir child's arrest to  secure services. 
• There is a lack of community-based services. 
• There is a lack of culturally and linguistically competent services. 
• There are insufficient self-help and peer/family support groups. 
• There is a lack of communication among agencies and mistrust among agencies. 
3) The lack of adequate support for groups involved in the delivery and receipt of 
mental health services in Indiana is a barrier. 
• There is a lack of appropriately trained workforce. 
• There is a lack of family respect and support. 
• There is a lack of support for children inside and outside the school setting. 
• There is a lack of support for schools and child care providers. 
• Despite the proven value of community-based services, those services are not widely, 
nor equally distributed throughout the state. 
• Therapeutic foster care, respite, and fam ily support services can be effective, and 
prevent institutionalization; however, t hey are limited, or unavailable in many 
communities. 
 - 8 - 
 
• The Systems of Care (SOC) in Indiana serve only 3% of all the children enrolled in the 
public mental health system. 
• The children's Home and Community-based 1915 9(c) Medicaid waiver served 44 
children in SFY2006.  The program has difficulty handling a higher volume of children 
because of a lack of community-based services and match. 
• There is limited availability of intensive community based behavioral health services.  
Case managers often have large caseloads (8-10 cases is ideal). 
4) The stigma associated with mental illness is a barrier.  
• The child’s needs should drive services and not their label.  For children with disabilities, 
the barrier is the eligibility label. Needed serv ices should be offered to the child despite 
the child’s label/eligibility category. It is re commended that servic e systems develop ways 
to offer services to children and families that  are having difficulties but do not reach the 
level of a mental health diagnosis (e.g., interventions such as counseling, support groups, 
or skill-building classes. 
• Stigma negatively impacts families/caregivers and prevents them from seeking help for 
mental health problems. 
• Many youth feel that it is preferable to re ceive treatment for addiction rather than mental 
health treatment. 
• Families/caregivers are re luctant to seek help becaus e of their concern about a 
diagnostic label following their child. 
• There is a racial/ethnic-based belief that mental health intervention is not acceptable. 
• Some believe that childhood mental health problems are the result of poor parenting. 
• Some believe that troubled youth just need more discipline.  The prevailing public 
understanding regarding the cause of troubled  youth behavior is poor or ineffective 
parenting and is historically not lin ked to medically treatable illness. 
• There is a belief that families c annot afford the necessary treatment. 
5) Lack of early recognition of mental heal th problems in young children, and the lack 
of accessible early childhood mental health interventions is a barrier. 
• Head Start reports an increasing number of  children are referred because of behavioral 
problems.  Behavior Management is on the Top 10 list for consultation requests. 
• First Steps has 36 mental health providers to serve entire state.     
• There is a commonly held belief that young children cannot be impacted by violence, 
trauma or have emotional problems. 
• Primary health care providers have limited time to address mental health issues. 
• Medicaid-funded screen, EPSDT (early, peri odic screening, diagnosis and treatment) is 
not accessed for mental health. 
• There is a lack of early childhood trained mental health professionals. 
• There is a lack of knowledge of the numbers of children who experience trauma. 
• There is a lack of training in early childhood social-emotional development among early 
care and education workers, parents, and health care professionals. 
 
In most states and communities, significant bar riers to mental health care services exist, and 
Indiana is no exception.  The Interagency Task Force focused on several key areas in order to address the barriers in Indiana:  Early Identification and Assessment, Accountability and Outcome 
Measurement, Finance and Budget, Best Practices,  Obtaining Services and Referral Networks, 
Early Learning Foundations and Indiana Academic  Standards, and Workforce Development and 
Training.

Early Identification and Assessment 
 
Most children in this country do not suffer from  mental health problems. Their development from 
birth through adolescence is healthy. As they grow and develop, children typically become 
resilient in dealing with multiple challenges. However, for some children and adolescents, mental 
illnesses are very real.  A complex interaction of  biological, behavioral, and environmental factors 
place certain children and youth at greater risk th an others for emotional and behavioral disorders 
that can range from mild to severe, some long la sting. Prevalence studies indicate that almost 
21% of children, ages 9 to 17, meet t he criteria for a mental health diagnosis.14  Adding a criterion 
for mental health symptoms with a significant functional impairment, the rate is 11%. These 
children experience significant impairments at home, at school, and with peers. When extreme 
functional impairment is the criterion, the esti mates are 5% of all children. Childhood, beginning 
from birth, is the time to support children’s social and emotional development as a means of preventing development of challenging behaviors
15.  Early detection through screening can help 
parents identify emotional or behavioral problems and assist them in getting appropriate services 
and supports before problems worsen and have longer term consequences16.   
 
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration (SAMHSA), US Department of 
Health and Human Services (DHHS), and the President’s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health do not recommend mandatory, universal screening.  The State of Indiana understands 
that parents are the decision-makers in the care for their children, including screening and early 
identification as well as treatment.  Involv ing parents and caregivers in the planning and 
organizing of early identification and ongoing treatment is imperative.  
Screening must be 
voluntary, active parental consent must be obtained, and clear procedures must be in 
place for notifying parents of the screening.   When sharing the results with parents, parents 
must be made aware that the results are an impor tant tool to use when helping and working with 
their child.  It is also important to note that  screening for children and youth must take into 
account child development stages. 
Goal and Strategies 
The following goal and strategies have been developed by the Interagency Task Force: 
 
Goal:   Establish standards for early identificati on and behavioral health assessments for children 
in all state systems. 
• Strategy 1:   Differentiate between assessment and screening. 
• Strategy 2:  Ensure active parental consent for all early identification processes and 
assessments. 
• Strategy 3:   Ensure early identification of behavio ral health needs of children with high 
risks including those in the child welf are and the juvenile justice systems. 
• Strategy 4:   Improve access to effective, appropri ate behavioral health services through 
the use of evidence based assessment tool s and related outcome quality management 
processes. 
• Strategy 5:   Implement a follow-up policy to longitudinally evaluate the value of early 
identification and assessment activities. 
Assessment versus Screening 
It is important to define the difference between  assessment and screening. “Most definitions of 
screening for mental health and substance use pr oblems describe a relatively brief process

designed to identify youth that are at increased risk of having disorders that warrant immediate 
attention, intervention, or more comprehensive review”17.  Screening in child service settings, 
such as primary health care, child welfare, ju venile court/probation, and detention centers can 
quickly identify youth who may have mental heal th or substance use needs.  When possible, 
behavioral health needs are identified and if nec essary, further assessment through a mental 
health specialist is recommended.  Parental involvement and approval is essential in the 
screening, assessment, and treatment processes.     
 
Assessment is a more comprehensive, indivi dualized examination that is lengthy and labor 
intensive (i.e. multiple interviews, record reviews, collateral contacts, and sometimes, 
psychological testing).  Assessments are us ually administered by trained mental health 
professional to evaluate the type and extent of mental health or addiction disorders in order to 
make treatment recommendations, level of care determination, and establish outcome measures.   
 
It should be noted that screening instruments, with  active parental consent and permission of the 
youth, have been used in schools across the Unit ed States.  Longitudinal studies conducted on 
these sites over a nine year period have show n conclusively that these screens save lives 
(reduce suicidality), identify needs for assessme nt of youth at risk for depression and other 
emotional and behavioral disorders, and inform parents of referral recommendations18.   
 
Screening and Assessment in Indiana 
 
Over the past ten years, a number of scr eening and assessment instruments have been used 
across the United States and by Indiana’s child service agencies and pr oviders in cooperation 
with their parents or caretakers to identify and assess the social, emotional, and mental issues of children.  The instruments have changed to improv e the quality of services.  Information is used 
by families and to inform intervention plans, to determine the appropriate level of care, to determine eligibility for public funding, and to measure outcomes.   
 
Within the Indiana Division of Mental Health  and Addiction, the CAFAS (Hodges, 1994) was 
replaced by the Hoosier Assurance Plan Inst rument for Children (HAPI-C) (Newman, et al., 
2003). All accredited community mental health c enters or hospitals are required to complete 
psychosocial assessments of children and adolesc ents who enter treatment.  A level of care 
assessment is required to determine eligibility for intensive community based services through a 
special Medicaid waiver or possible admission to  a state hospital.  Eligibility for developmental 
assessments by IDEA Part C programs inclu de social, emotional, and behavioral health 
concerns.  Medicaid EPSDT screens completed by primary health care prov iders include a 
behavioral health domain. The public school systems assess childr en who have learning, 
behavioral health needs, and possible special edu cation needs. The Department of Correction 
uses a number of instruments to evaluate t he needs of children in their facilities.  
 
Screening children and youth with higher risks of social, emotional, or behavioral health issues, 
such as those in the child welfare or juvenile justice systems, has been recommended by 
researchers, advocates and national policy as early identificati on and effective intervention has 
been demonstrated to result in better outcomes for children and their families19.  Upon completion 
of a two year study, the Indiana Bar Associatio n recommended screening of youth in detention 
and on probation20. The Department of Child Services and juvenile court judges often refer 
children for assessment to help identify needs and plan appropriate services. Indiana’s child 
welfare system began screening child ren placed into substitute care or adjudicated CHINS in 
January 2005. For about 30% of the children, possible mental health needs were identified,

indicating a need for further assessment.  Preliminar y evaluation of this initiative indicate that 
children and families already receiving mental heal th treatment have less disrupted placements 
and less repeated abuse or neglect21.  Children whose mental health needs are identified in the 
screening; however, appear to be at higher ri sk for disrupted placements. Identifying this need 
and intervening may reduce the risk.   
 
Recommendation Regarding Assessment  
 
The fragmentation of Indiana’s child  service systems, like most across the country, is reflected in 
the multiple assessment processes. The qualit y and scope of behavioral health assessments for 
youth with mental health or substance abuse nee ds vary widely; recommendations for treatment 
vary by community, profession, and service sy stem. Some children and families experience 
repeated assessments, retelling their story, and st ill have difficulty accessing effective services 
that fit their needs.  
 
To improve the quality and effectiveness of behav ioral health services for children and their 
families in Indiana, uniform assessment tool s and related quality outcome management 
processes are recommended that meet the following criteria:   
• meaningful to the children and families 
• inform care planning 
• inform decisions about the appropriate level of care 
• measure outcomes 
• identify training needs and gaps in services 
The assessment process would help families and children identify and communicate needs and 
possible resources. The information would help families, c linicians, probation officers, child 
welfare family case managers, and judges dev elop intervention plans and measure outcomes.  
Information could be aggregated to identify successful services, training needs, and gaps in services.  Real time data could be used to make decisions for individual care, workforce 
development, and resource allocation.  When aggregated, such data are important for accountability and improving the quality of services, as discussed in the following sections. 
  
Current Agency Pro cesses for Assessment  
Current processes have been identified and can be found in Appendix B.   
 
Next Steps 
The Children’s Social, Emotional, and Behavioral Health Plan Interagency Task Force recommends establishing partnerships with existing work groups that are currently working 
towards the establishment of cross- system assessments in Indiana.

Accountability and Outcome Measurement 
 
Senate Enrolled Act 529 Chapter 16 (IC 20-19-5) calls for a plan that includes guidelines for 
creating a children's social, emotional, and behavio ral health system with shared accountability 
among state agencies in order to conduct ongoing needs assessments, use outcome indicators 
and benchmarks to measure progress, and implement quality data tracking and reporting 
systems. 
 
Goal and Strategies 
The overarching goal for accountability is to ensur e that resources are provided to children and 
families in need of social, emotional and behavioral health services with specific focus on the 
children being served by the system and those in need of services who are not currently being served.  The following goal and strategies have been developed by the Interagency Task Force: 
 
Goal:   Responsible systems (mental health, substa nce use, child welfare, juvenile justice, 
schools, Medicaid, and primary healthcare) are ac countable to provide a network of collaboration 
that assures that children and families receive needed social, emotional and behavioral health 
services. 
• Strategy 1:   Establish procedure to evaluate t he strengths and needs of Indiana’s 
Behavioral Health network across child service agencies. 
o Research existing assessments and use existing data to compile for needs 
assessment baseline. 
o Include an analysis of strengths. 
o Include fiscal analysis in the evaluation. 
o Conduct a literature review for best practices. 
o Create final report with the results of the assessment. 
• Strategy 2:   Utilize indicators, outcomes and benchmarks to measure progress and 
continuously improve quality. 
o Build consensus on outcomes. 
o Convene a public forum to determine in dicators, outcomes, and benchmarks.  A 
uniform assessment tool, as descri bed under the Early Identification and 
Assessment section, should be used as a primary source of outcome data to 
measure progress.  If used across child  service systems, this tool will be a 
primary part of the outcomes measurement system.   
• Strategy 3:   Implement quality data tracking and reporting systems. 
o Identify data sources and review proces s by which we collect data.  Make 
recommendations for process improvements. 
o Data tracking and reporting systems must cover all relevant privacy laws affected 
by this project including but not limited to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 
(FERPA) issues. 
o Develop a shared data base across all involved agencies with a standard 
identifier for each individual using an enterprise data warehouse model. 
o Legally mandate sharing of information with parental consent. 
o The data collected using such a system  should include sufficient data on the type 
of services provided (to whom, when, under what conditions and at what cost) as 
well as outcome data so that effective models of care that are already being used 
in Indiana can be identified.  Please refer to the Best Practices section for more 
information. 
• Strategy 4:   Functionalize consistent nomenclat ure (common language) across systems. 
o Identify disparate nomenclature. 
o Develop shared nomenclature.

Needs and Strengths Assessment of Indiana’s Behavioral Health 
Network 
Needs and strengths assessments are important in  order to ensure that resources are available 
for children who require services based on a numbe r of factors.  First, the cost of providing 
services is rising and at the same time the resources available for care are limited.  Second, 
many people have inequitable access to adequate services, and many governments are unable 
to provide such care universally. Third, there is a large variation in availability and use of services 
by geographical area.  Availability tends to be inversely related to the need of the population 
served.  Finally, the expectations of members of the public have led to greater concerns about the quality of the services they receive from  access and equity to appropriateness and 
effectiveness
22.  A needs assessment collects data on each of these four points and allows policy 
makers to ensure that requirements are being met in the community.  
 
There is a need for an ongoing Indiana needs and strengths assessment, although resources to 
conduct such an assessment are limited.  Successful needs assessments require a practical 
understanding of what is involved, the time and resources necessary to undertake assessments, 
and sufficient integration of the results into planni ng and commissioning of local services.  We 
need to be conscious of the fact that there are several existing studies and assessments that 
should be taken into consideration prior to conducting a formal assessment.  These existing studies include the Evaluation of  Systems Reform in the Annie. E. Casey Foundation Mental 
Health Initiative for Urban Children: Summary of Findings and Lessons Learned, The Indiana State Bar Association’s Civil Rights of Children Committee Report and the Indiana Consortium for 
Mental Health Services Research Sixth Annual  Evaluation Briefing of the Dawn Project 
Evaluation Study. 
Outcome Indicators and Benchmarks 
Given the increasing focus on accountability, it follows that clinicians, providers and 
administrators are interested in determining the outcomes of care delivered to children with social, emotional, and behavioral health issues
23.  Outcomes, benchmarks and data reporting are 
all related to the assessment tool that is chos en (refer to Assessment and Screening section of 
the plan).  These variables are linked fundamentally to the assessment discussion as the tool is 
more than a tool for direct service planning.  The tool is for decision support and data can be 
aggregated for utilization and quality management with in an organization and at the state level.  
 
In order to effectively measure outcomes, the state must build consensus on outcomes through a public forum.  State agencies must work with community partners to establish appropriate 
indicators, outcomes, and benchmarks. 
 
Data Tracking and Reporting Systems 
There are many issues surrounding data in Indi ana.  The data are not consistent, not readily 
available, may not contain all encounters, and primarily collect financial information on an 
individual.  Wide variance in different geographic regions, variability in nomenclature, and 
variance in expenditures for particular services  also have been identified as issues across 
databases. 
 
The following example illustrates several of thes e concerns.  Through I ndiana’s experience with 
the child welfare screening, assessment and treatme nt initiative, the limitations of the current 
systems have become apparent.  No one state database included the data needed to evaluate 
the implementation or outcomes of this initiative .   Using a unique identifier to link information 
                                                 
22  Wright, J., et al, 1998. 
23 Hoagwood, K., et al, 1996.  
 - 14 - 
 
from DCS, Medicaid, and DMHA, de-identified information was matched and then shared for 
evaluation.  This allowed the use of outcome  data to improve the quality of care and helped 
identify the limitations of the current fragmented databases.  Each has been designed for specific 
purposes and involves different state technology sy stems and contractors.  Each is limited in its 
information.  For example, DCS has not recor ded whether or not an assessment was done for a 
particular child in an accessible form than can be aggregated. 
 
Moreover, there are many federal data requirem ents that drive agency database requirements. 
State programs interact with federal counterparts  to address issues requiring access to data. 
Federal agencies need this information for better planning and budgeting. This interaction is also 
required for reporting and auditing purposes. It is important to note that each program usually 
maps to a separate information system t hat in turn maps to several databases24.  It will be difficult 
to modify data collections based on these require ments.  Any modifications must ensure that 
federal reporting requirements continue to be fulfilled. 
 
In many cases, agency systems have child inform ation collected on an individual basis but there 
is no aggregate data collection.  Each agency has information by individual and there may or may not be comparable indicators and benchmarks across systems.  These indicators supply several critical data sets that are required to ensure the individual is viewed  holistically.  It is important for 
these similarities to be identified and for shared databases to be developed.  The data collected using such a system should include sufficient dat a on the type of services provided (to whom, 
when, under what conditions and at what cost) as  well as outcome data so that effective models 
of care that are already being used in Indiana can be identified. 
Nomenclature 
Nomenclature refers to a system or  set of terms for a particular di scipline, in this case, social, 
emotional and behavioral health services for childre n.  Every state agency involved in providing 
services to children uses their own set of terms for diagnoses and services.  In order to ensure 
we are providing a continuum of services we need to identify the disparate nomenclature and 
establish a common language across agencies. 
Next Steps 
The Children’s Social, Emotional, and Behavioral Health Plan Interagency Task Force 
recommends establishing a procedure for a stat ewide needs and strengths assessment of the 
behavioral health network across child service systems.  Successful needs assessments require 
a practical understanding of what is involved, the time and resources necessary to undertake 
assessments, and sufficient integration of the results into planning and commissioning of local 
services.  This assessment should utilize indi cators, outcomes and benchmarks to measure 
progress, implement quality data tracking and re porting systems, and functionalize consistent 
nomenclature across systems (mental health, subs tance use, child welfare, juvenile justice, 
schools, Medicaid and primary healthcare).   
 
The Interagency Task Force also recommends creating a subcommittee to identify the existing data sources, review the process by whic h we collect data in each agency and make 
recommendations for process improvements.  The end result should be an enterprise data 
warehouse model for use by all agencies involved in the delivery of services for children with 
social, emotional and behavioral health needs.

Finance and Budget 
 
Senate Enrolled Act 529 Chapter 16 (IC 20-19-5) calls for a state budget for children's social, 
emotional, and mental health prevention and treatment; and recommendations as to how state agencies and local entities can obtain federal funding and other sources of funding to implement 
a children's social, emotional, and behavioral health plan. 
 
The cost of mental illness is devastatingly high.   The United States annual, economic, indirect 
cost of mental illnesses is estimated to be $79 b illion.  Most of that amount—approximately $63 
billion—reflects the loss of produc tivity as a result of illnesses.  But indirect co sts also include 
almost $12 billion in mortality costs (lost produc tivity resulting from premature death) and almost 
$4 billion in productivity losses for incarcerated individuals and for the time of  those who provide 
family care (President’s New Freedom Commission Report).  
 
In 1997, (latest year comparable data are availabl e), the United States spent more than $1 trillion 
on health care, and that includes $71 billion on treating mental illnesses.  57% of mental health expenditures are predominately publicly funded, an d 46% of overall health care expenditures are 
funded.  From 1987 through 1997, less was spent on mental health funding because of cutbacks 
in hospital expenditures and declines in private heal th spending under managed care (President’s 
New Freedom Commission Report).   
 
The current system of mental health care must re ly on many sources of financing. Many of the 
funding streams are tightly restricted in who can use them and how they can be used. Providing access to effective treatments and services that are easy to navigat e and that use flexible funding 
streams is crucial to transforming mental heal th care.  Currently, eligibility requirements for 
receiving services or supports and reimbursement  policies vary widely, and states must rely on 
waivers to provide treatme nts and supports that federa l standards deem optional
25. 
 
Financing services for children’s social, emoti onal and mental health requires state and local 
officials to use all relevant resources effectiv ely.  Mental health syst ems for children and youth 
are supported by a range of financing sources that support elements within each comprehensive 
mental health system.   The federal government provides much  of the funding for children with 
emotional and mental disorders, unfortunately, the sources of federal funds are numerous and 
complex resulting in a web of programs that is hard to understand in the context of service 
delivery26. 
 
Medicaid finances the majority of children’s mental health services.  Although over two-thirds of 
children have private insurance coverage, less than half of children’s mental health treatment is 
paid by this source. Federal grants provide some  support for prevention and early intervention, 
including through Head Start, Maternal and Child Health, Part B and Early Intervention under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Federal grant support for treatment comes from mental 
health, child welfare, and juvenile justice funds . Federal grant funds also support system 
development and coordination. Addi tionally, states invest funding in children’s mental health, 
primarily for treatment services, and increasingly as Medicaid matching funds
27.  
 
The interagency task force explored Indiana’s f unding options for mental health services which 
can be found in Appendix A, the inventory of pub lic systems, services, and programs serving 
Indiana children.  The Task Force then turned the focus to improving the funding structure and 
making recommendations for ways to improve the system.

Goals and Strategies 
The overarching goal for finance and budget is to ensure that resources are provided to children 
and families in need of social, emotional and behavioral health services.  The two broad 
categories are systems issues and equity issues .  The following goal and strategies have been 
developed by the Interagency Task Force: 
 
Goal:  SYSTEMS:  Maximize current investments and leverage available funds to ensure children 
receive the services they need.  
• Strategy 1:  Ensure families and parents have access  to information regarding eligibility 
and available services.  
• Strategy 2:  Create a central reimbursement ent ity to ensure collaborative funding 
involving DMHA, DCS, DOE, DOC, OMPP, ISDH (and any other relevant agency).  
o Explore consolidation of all rate-setti ng and licensing for residential treatment 
facilities to a single state agency. 
o Identify funds from multiple state and lo cal agencies, including those that can be 
braided or pooled, to support children’s mental health prevention, early 
intervention and treatment efforts at t he community, local, regional, and state 
levels. 
o Explore a fee for service model. 
o Explore a capitated rate and/or managed care. 
o Explore a “flex-fund” model that can pr ovide necessary services and items for 
children and families that no serv ice system is able to provide. 
o Work with counties to ensure access to local funding.  Start with a review of the 
early intervention plans (both community and individual) at the county level. 
• Strategy 3:  Examine a tiered approach to services based on levels of intensity  
o Establish how children are entering the system 
o Define populations 
• Strategy 4:  Maximize access to federal funds. 
o Explore the use of various federal programs (e.g., Title V Maternal and Child 
Health Services Block Grant, Juvenile  Justice, 1915C Medicaid Waiver) to 
support children’s mental health programs and services. 
o Advocate for increased federal funding to support comprehensive children’s 
mental health programs and services. 
• Strategy 5:  Maximize education funding. 
o Explore expanding provision of mental health services in schools. 
o Explore development of a program to plac e licensed clinical social workers and 
mental health professionals in schools to  provide services for students who are 
enrolled in Medicaid. (Note: The schools must be eligible and certified to bill Medicaid for services.) 
o Promote expanded use of federal funding for early intervening services through 
the reauthorized Individuals with Disab ilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 
(IDEIA) for students who are not in special education. 
o Determine opportunities for social and emotional learning and student support in 
the reauthorized IDEIA. 
• Strategy 6:  Explore use of Medicaid to ensure that children receive appropriate mental 
health services. 
o Explore expanding Medicaid reimbursement for children’s mental health services 
on a continuum for children with moderate to severe mental health disorders. 
o Explore modifying the State Medicaid  Plan to expand the number and type of 
providers (e.g., licensed clinical social workers and psychologists, licensed clinical professional counselors, nurse practitioners, and nurses) who are eligible 
to receive reimbursement for asse ssment and treatment services under 
Medicaid.  
 - 17 - 
 
o Explore various Medicaid waiver options to maximize the availability of federally 
matched mental health services for Indiana children including an early 
intervention waiver. 
o Re-engineer Medicaid eligibility – participate in process so issues are 
represented 
• Strategy 7:  Identify necessary legislative changes.  
   
Goal:  EQUITY:  All children should receive services based on individual needs and strengths 
regardless of availability of funding.  
• Strategy 1:   Examine eligibility and determine if state imposed eligibility can be changed 
and/or broadened. 
o Focus on financial and individual needs. 
o Examine eligibility determination process.   
• Strategy 2:   Focus on non-Medicaid eligible ki ds who do not have private insurance and 
explore mechanisms and strategies for in creasing private insurance coverage of 
children’s mental health services (parity).  
• Strategy 3:   Focus on Early Intervention (0-5). 
• Strategy 4:   Identify necessary legislative changes. 
• Strategy 5:   Improve access to quality care that is culturally competent. 
• Strategy 6:   Improve access to quality care in rural and remote areas. 
 
Systems 
The broad goal of improving systems related to funding includes maximizing Indiana’s current 
investments and leveraging available funds to ensu re children receive the services they need.  
Numerous federal programs provide Indiana with funds that are either directly targeted to 
children’s mental health or could be used to suppor t an array of services in some capacity. Many 
of these federal resources offer flexibility in the use of funds and program design, within federal 
parameters. Efforts that maximi ze and coordinate federal program funds, state general revenue 
funds, and local and private funds can result in be tter ways of using scarce resources and create 
new investments for children’s mental health.  
 
One of the most important strategies is to create a central reimbursement entity to ensure 
collaborative funding involving DMHA, DCS, DOE, DOC, OMPP, ISDH and any other relevant 
agency.  Blending or braiding funding allows the de cisions for the child to be made by the family 
and those working closely with the family.  Both st rategies offer flexibility and allow the provider to 
focus on outcomes.  Systems that are set up to allow this type of funding must track, document and account for funds that are spent.  Blending f unding into a central reimbursement entity, even 
on a small scale, has advantages over braiding f unding because it offers flexibility for state and 
local agencies and reduces the administrative burden.  Blended funding can also allow systems to fund activities that are not reimbursable through specific categorical programs.  As a result 
blended funds can help plug funding gaps in the service continuum
28.   
 
Braided funding may be more applicable to federal funds because funds from various sources are 
used to pay for a service package for an indivi dual child.  Tracking and accountability for each pot 
of money is maintained at the administrative level29.  The child and family would still see a 
seamless funding source for the services they re ceive.  The recommendation to create a central 
reimbursement entity would need to include some combination of blended and braided funding 
based on the requirements of each revenue source. 
 
It is also important to note that the way the Stat e provides mental/behavior health services to its 
Medicaid (Hoosier Healthwise) recipients is changing.  In the 2007 re-procurement of the Hoosier 
                                                 
28 Bazelon Center, 2003.  
29 Bazelon Center, 2003.  
 - 18 - 
 
Healthwise Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), the Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning 
(OMPP) will be requiring the MCOs to provi de and pay claims for all Hoosier Healthwise 
behavioral health services except for Medi caid Rehabilitation Option (MRO) services. 
 
The Hoosier Healthwise population consists of children, pregnant women, and low-income families.  These members qualify for Medicaid based on income rather than disability  and it is 
assumed that women and children enrolled in Hoosier Healthwise are free from serious mental illness and other chronic medical co nditions that would qualify them for Medicaid Disability.    
 
The current Hoosier Healthwise program “carve s” behavioral health services out of managed 
care.  This means that while MCOs reimburse providers for all physical health care, prescription 
medications, and inpatient hospitalization, mental hea lth providers bill their claims to the Medicaid 
fiscal agent.  This results in fragmentation and a lack of continuity and coordination between 
patients’ physical and mental health care.  Despite the MCOs paying for mental health 
medications, they do not receive record of the m ental health treatment the patient is receiving. 
Carving behavioral health services into the managed care organizations communicates the 
connectivity of mental and physical health.   In so doing, there is a reduction of the stigma for 
pursuing and receiving mental health services and pr omoting recognition of these services at the 
same level of concern as other medical services.  The following are Medicaid’s goals for the transition and implementation of the behavioral health carve-in:      
 
1. There will be no disruption of current/pre-carve-in medication regimes. 
• The pharmacy benefit will not change due to the carve-in.  Presently, Hoosier 
Healthwise members obtain all medications through their MCO.  HEA 1325-2005 
created a Mental Health Quality Advisory Committee to standardize authorization 
requirements for mental health medications for fee-for-service Medicaid and the 
MCOs. 
• The MCO is required to have a process for appealing restrictions of needed 
medication.  Currently, requests for medications that are not on the formulary are 
reviewed by the MCO for medical necessity.  This team includes representation 
by a psychiatrist.   
• Monitoring of the consistency of prescribing practices for behavioral health will be 
monitored through the Mental Health Quality Advisory Committee. 
  
2. There will be access to any medically necessary behavioral health care 
• The MCOs are required, by contract, to  provide medically necessary treatment.  
If they are not providing care, they are out-of-compliance with their contract.  
• The RFP requires MCO’s to have Behavioral Health Care Managers to oversee 
the more complex cases, ensuring medically  necessary services are provided.   
• The RFP will require the MCO’s to implem ent the use of the CANS as a universal 
tool to assist with service and level of ca re determination.  This tool is currently 
endorsed by DMHA. 
• The carve-in may actually increase consultation with and referrals to mental 
health providers due to the contractual partnerships that  have been encouraged. 
• Participants who require intensive, ongo ing behavioral health services for chronic 
conditions can apply for Medicaid Disability to ensure appropriate eligibility and 
levels of service need are met. 
  
3. Access to emergency services will not be adversely impacted 
• Hospitals are required by the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active 
Labor Act (EMTALA) to screen everyone that comes to the emergency room regardless of ability to pay.  MCOs are required by the federal managed care 
rules to pay for all emergency services  that meet the “prudent lay person 
standard”. 
 - 19 - 
 
• MCOs are encouraged to contract wi th CMHCs to provide behavioral health 
services.  All CMHCs are required to have crisis services available to 
Consumers.   
    
4. Children will have access to behavioral health specialists for diagnosis and 
treatment and this care will be coordina ted and shared with primary medical 
providers. 
• Hoosier Healthwise participants can self-refer to behavioral health services with 
in the MCO network. 
• The primary medical provider (PMP) may serve as the first contact, but if he or 
she cannot treat the memb er, the member will be referred to a specialist.  The 
benefit is that the PMP will be able to tr ack the referral, know the patient’s 
behavioral health treatment plan, and can work with the mental health 
practitioner to ensure compliance and coordination with the member’s physical health care.  
•  MCO’s are encouraged to contract with CMHCs who have the expertise 
providing care for behavior health disorders of varying severity and impairment. Formal contracts may actually lead to increased referrals to mental health providers.  
• OMPP acknowledges that the Hoosier Healthwise Managed Care Organizations 
are designed to care for healthy, low-income individuals.  Participants who meet criteria for SED and SMI may request a review from their local DFR for eligibility 
and enrollment in   Disability Medicaid to ensure they have access to needed 
services.  During this eligibility revi ew, these members will have full access to 
their MRO services without requiring an authorization from their MCO.  
• As Participants reach recovery, they will be able to maintain needed medications 
through their PMP without dependence on a second set of appointments with a 
specialist.  The PMP will already be informed of the course of care, making this transition seamless. There is a great advantage to children and families to have 
this link in place.  
• The MCOs will be required to adhere to IC 12-15-12-9 and allow members to 
obtain care from any Medicaid-enrolled psychiatrist through self-referral. 
 
5.  Efforts will be made to decrease the possibility consumers will have to change 
providers. 
• Contracts between MCOs and CMHC are being encouraged as the CMHCs have 
been the primary provider of behavioral health services in most communities. Members will be educated on the entire provid er network of MCOs in their region, 
including the behavioral health providers.  If  their mental health provider is in only 
one, the member can select the plan in which their provider is enrolled.   
• If the current behavioral health provider is  not a part of any Hoosier Healthwise 
HMO, the member will have to work with his or her primary medical provider to 
determine if an out-of-network re ferral is medically necessary. 
• The new regions that MCOs will bid on and be required to provide all covered 
services are smaller, which fost ers care in the local community. 
• MCOs and Providers can contract across  regions, not just within regions. 
 
6. Needed inpatient services will be availabl e and this information will be available to 
PMPs. 
• The MCOs are presently required to  pay for inpatient behavioral health 
treatment. 
• Carving behavioral health into managed care will allow them access to the 
patient’s full medical and mental health care history to make medically necessary 
admissions.   
 - 20 - 
 
• The carve-in will allow the MCO to assist in discharge planning.  Presently the 
mental health patient can be discharged from the hospital without follow-up 
coordination with the PMP or other health providers.  Coordinated efforts among 
all those involved with a Participant’s ca re may lead to decreases in recidivism 
rates. 
 
7.   Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) reimbursement for serving the 
        Hoosier Healthwise population will not be adversely impacted. 
• MRO services will remain carved out of Hoosier Healthwise and will be billed to 
Medicaid FFS. 
• Clinic option billing will be sent dire ctly to the MCO for reimbursement.  
• The carve-in does not decrease the ability to bill for service but changes to whom 
those services are billed. 
 
8. Consumers will benefit from the encouraged relationships established between 
MCOs and behavioral health providers 
• Data suggest that a mental health co nsumer benefits from a centralized, 
coordinated source of care.  Coordinatin g service delivery is the primary aim of 
this.  
 
9. Administrative costs related to the changes will be kept to a minimum 
 
• There will only be two MCOs per region  (except potentially the Marion County 
region).   
• If a mental health provider contracts with the MCO, it can bill electronically. 
• This is no different than billing mult iple versions of private insurance. 
Equity 
The broad goal of ensuring equity in the state’s mental health systems means that all children 
should receive services based on individual nee ds and strengths regardless of availability of 
funding.  Barriers to mental health care exist for all children with mental health needs but they are 
more pervasive for some groups.  According to re search, racial and ethnic disparities are evident 
in children’s access to and receipt of mental heal th services. While the prevalence of mental 
disorders in racial and ethnic minorities is simila r to that of their white counterparts, minorities are 
less likely to have access to mental health servic es, less likely to receive needed care, and more 
likely to receive poor quality of care than whites.  In children, Hispanics are the most likely of all 
racial/ethnic groups followed by African-Americ ans to have the highest rates of unmet need for 
mental health services30.   
 
One strategy is to focus on non-Medicaid eligible children who do not have private insurance and explore mechanisms and strategies for increasing private insurance coverage of children’s mental health services.  Over three quarters of children and youth who are publicly- or privately-insured 
or uninsured report unmet needs for mental health  care.  Moreover, uninsured children are more 
likely to have unmet needs for mental health care . Nearly 90% of uninsured children report unmet 
needs for mental health care as compared to 73% of publicly-insured children and 79% of 
privately-insured children
31. 
 
Next Steps 
As stated earlier, Senate Enrolled Act 529 Chap ter 16 (IC 20-19-5) calls for a state budget for 
children's social, emotional, and mental health prevention and treatment; and recommendations

as to how state agencies and local entities can obtain federal funding and other sources of 
funding to implement a children's social, emot ional, and behavioral health plan.  Because the 
goals and strategies outlined in this section are complicated, the recommendation is that a 
subcommittee be formed with the State Budget Agency as an integral member agency to explore 
each of the strategies listed.

Best Practices 
 
Senate Enrolled Act 529 Chapter 16 (IC 20-19-5 ) called for recommendations for procedures 
concerning the positive development of child ren and recommendations on how to facilitate 
research on best practices and model programs for children’s social, emotional and behavioral 
health. 
The President’s New Freedom Commission (2003) calls for the use of evidence based 
interventions and the ongoing development of this knowledge base. More people could recover from serious mental illnesses if they have acce ss in their communities to supports and effective 
treatments tailored to meet their needs.  The Co mmission also discovered the following, that: 
new, relevant research findings need to be system atically conveyed to front-line mental health 
providers and applied to practice; treatment offered must be sensitive to the commonalities, differences, and diversity of Americans; and services and treatment based on consumer 
preference and proven effectiveness mu st be the basis for reimbursements.   
Although prior to 1990, there was no mention of evidence based practice related to children’s 
behavioral health32, the research literature has increase d at a fast pace.  Evidence based 
practices refer to programs that meet some specified research criteria for effectiveness. In actual 
practice, these evidence based practices are often not available33.  For a listing of children's 
mental health evidence base practices that are available refer to www.NREBP.org. 
A large percentage of the behavioral health servic es received by children occur in schools and 
services outside clinical settings. Because child ren are involved in multiple systems (mental 
health, substance use, child welfare, juvenile ju stice, schools, Medicaid, and primary healthcare) 
a wide range of providers will need to be trai ned in evidence based or effective practices34. 
The gap between science and practice includes limit ations in the evidence base, implementation 
issues, and limited capacity for outcome based quality management.  Much research has focused on specific behavioral symptoms in controlled settings. Real people have complex needs and 
adaptations may be needed in the interventions, se ttings and service systems to effectively 
implement research based practices
35. Futhermore, some best practices may not have been 
studied and documented in t he research literature.  
Practice based evidence is the use of informatio n from actual practice to inform the research 
base36. Practice based evidence can identify best pr actices.  When the evidence indicates the 
need to improve practice, the existing evidence base can be used to suggest more effective interventions. The availability and use of real -time data regarding outcomes and practice is 
central to identifying best practices and to effectively implementing evidence based practices
37. 
The following issues must be addressed in or der to identify, develop and implement effective 
models or best practices of care in Indiana: 
• Identify effective models of care (best practices) 
• Assess readiness for change 
• Apply implementation research

• Measure fidelity to the model 
• Track outcomes 
• Use data for quality management. 
The following goal and strategies for the identific ation and dissemination of best practices include 
using the emerging evidence base in research and practice based evidence to integrate effective 
social, emotional, and behavioral health practi ces in Indiana’s child service systems. 
Goal and Strategies 
The goal and strategies in this section were adapted from the Technical Assistance Center for 
Systems of Care and Evidence Based Practices for Children and Families38.  The TA Center is 
funded through a contract with the Family and Social Services Administration Division of Mental 
Health and Addiction and supports statewide transformation efforts.   
 
Goal:   Create, implement and sustain an accountable  system that uses real-time process and 
outcome data to continuously improve the quality of services and that ma kes effective models of 
care available to all young people with mental health issues and/or substance use problems and their families.   
• Strategy 1:   Advance evidence-based practices through dissemination of a combined 
knowledge base and demonstration projects.  Create a public-private partnership to guide 
their implementation.  
o Identify State and Local Partners - Identify  key state and local partners (including 
public and private agencies and community members) involved in transforming the mental health system in Indiana. 
o Assessment - Assist in conducting an assessment of local and state readiness to 
adopt new structure for shared acc ountability, quality improvement and 
implementing effective models of care. 
o Services and Resources - Through participation in appropriate workgroups and 
subcommittees, written communication and personal contacts, educate key 
partners about the services and resources available in the State to meet the 
shared accountability, quality improvement and implementation of effective 
model of care objectives of statewide initiatives. 
o Issue Papers - Develop brief and timely summaries of research, issues and 
theories to disseminate key policy decisions. 
o Training - Provide training to public and private partners, community members, 
and other individuals as requested on relevant topics. 
• Strategy 2: Make an informed decision regarding best practices for Indiana.  
o Design the following components (and other s as appropriate) of a structure: 
Implementation Plan, Measurement of Fidelity to Identified Practice Models, 
Outcome Management System, and Quality Improvement Process. 
• Strategy 3:  Implement best practices model for Indiana.  
o Training - Design and conduct trainings to: provide information on shared 
accountability, quality improvement and im plementation of effective models of 
care structure; build statewide and local enthusiasm; give guidance on how to 
manage the implementation process; and clarify the goals and objectives. 
o Coaching - Provide individualized coachi ng to local communities and the state as 
they work through the stages of the im plementation process.  Coaching will be 
based on the latest implementation rese arch and experience working with 
system of care communities. 
o Monitoring Implementation Outcomes - Collect data necessary to ensure that the 
best practices are implemented as planned.   
• Strategy 4:  Maintain best practices model.  
                                                 
38 Effland & McIntyre, 2005.  
 - 24 - 
 
o Consultation - Provide consultation in (1) using fidelity and outcome data for 
quality improvement purposes; (2) asse ssing outcomes; and (3) use the findings 
to improve the quality of implementation of the best practices model(s). 
o Training - Provide ongoing training to the workforce to sustain the best practices 
model(s).  Trainings in this step would be designed to: acknowledge the 
challenges associated with implemen ting and sustaining change; generate 
improvements in practice based on fidelity and outcome data collected; support, 
motivate and challenge existing workers; educate new workers on best practices.  
• Strategy 5:   Implement quality data tracking and reporting systems. 
o Develop shared data bases with sta ndard identifier for each individual. 
o The data collected using such a system should include sufficient data on the type 
of services provided (to whom, when, under what conditions and at what cost) as 
well as outcome data so that effective models of care that are already being used in Indiana can be identified.  Please re fer to the Accountability and Outcome 
Measurement section for more information.
 
Next Steps 
The first step in creating best practices and model programs for children is to initiate a process to 
disseminate knowledge about best practices and outc omes quality management to stakeholders.  
The second step is to develop an action plan.  The th ird step is to create an infrastructure for data 
collection and quality management.  After the action plan is complete, a business plan focused on funding to support the dissemination of best practices (effective implementation of evidence 
based practices and use of practice based evi dence to identify new best practices) should be 
developed.  The final step is to implement targeted best practices considering the strategies listed 
in the previous section.

Obtaining Services and Referral Networks  
 
Social, emotional and behavioral health is a critical component of a child’s health, well-being, and 
learning.  Yet stigma attached to mental health concerns and misinformation about mental health are some of the most significant barriers to ens uring that children and their families have access 
to a quality mental health system.  The Presi dent’s New Freedom Commission defined stigma as 
“a cluster of negative attitudes and beliefs that mo tivate the general public to fear, reject, avoid, 
and discriminate against people with mental illnesses.”  According to the Commission, stigma 
leads to the avoidance of socializing, living, wo rking with, employing or  renting to people with 
mental disorders—especially severe disorders, such as schizophrenia.   
Not only does mental illness lead to low self-est eem, hopelessness, and isolation, but it deters 
the public from seeking care.  People with mental health problem internalize public attitudes, 
conceal symptoms, and become so embarrassed or ashamed that they do not seek treatment. 
The Commission found that when individuals underst and the facts, they are less likely to view 
mental illness as a stigma and more likely to seek treatment for mental health problems39.  
Reducing stigma involves increasing aw areness and encouraging treatment.   
 
Early prevention and intervention efforts can help  assure that children who have mental health 
needs are identified early and provided with appropr iate services.   Systems that serve children 
must be equipped with knowledge and skills to identif y early warning signs of problems in social 
and emotional development. 
 
Senate Enrolled Act 529 Chapter 16 (IC 20-19-5)  calls for recommendations concerning procedures to assist a child and the child's family  in obtaining necessary services to treat social, 
emotional, and mental health issues;  procedures to coordinate provider services and interagency 
referral networks for an individual from birth th rough twenty-two (22) years of age; how to 
implement a public awareness campaign to reduce the stigma of mental illness; and educate individuals about the benefits of children's so cial, emotional, and behavioral development; and 
how to access children's social, emotional, and behavioral development services. 
 
In order to improve services for people with mental illnesses, the collaboration among mental 
health care and general medical care systems must be reviewed.  Mental health and physical 
health are clearly connected, and call for a collaborative system in order to help primary care 
providers effectively treat common mental disord ers.  Primary care providers can also help 
reduce stigma by informing and helping the pub lic recognize and identify their own symptoms and 
the symptoms of their children.  They can also  help those in need with the identified problems40.     
Goals and Strategies 
Goal: PROCESS:  Develop procedures to assist a child and the child's family in obtaining 
necessary services to treat social, emotional, and mental health issues including procedures to 
coordinate provider services and interagency re ferral networks for an individual from birth through 
twenty-two (22) years of age.  
• Strategy 1:   Identify gaps in the existing  processes for each State agency. 
• Strategy 2:   Create master flow chart for the entry  point into the mental health system for 
children and make recommendations  for process improvements. 
• Strategy 3:   Create a process for children who do not need to enter the mental health 
system but do need some services. 
• Strategy 4:   Integrate social and emotional develop ment practices into existing services. 
• Strategy 5:   Disseminate information and referral procedures of state and local programs 
serving children with social and emotional conc erns and their families to stakeholders.

• Goal: PUBLIC AWARENESS:   Develop a comprehensive, culturally inclusive, and multi-
faceted public awareness campaign to reduce  the stigma of mental illness, educate 
families, the general public and other key audiences about the importance of social, 
emotional and behavioral health development. 
• Strategy 1:   Address mental health with the same urgency as physical health.  The 
epidemiological data is supportive of treating the children’s mental health issues as a serious public health challenge. 
• Strategy 2:   Focus on dissemination of information regarding mental health in schools in 
order for students to accept other students with mental illness.  School-based prevention 
programs for suicide are ideal because the school provides an environment with the highest likelihood of exposure to a pr evention program for adolescents.   
o Identify existing school programs  and evaluate for effectiveness. 
o Increase resources for evaluations in schools. 
o Focus on public service announcements in schools. 
o Educate teachers about mental illness including how to identify youth at risk. 
o Encourage mentoring relationships in schools. 
o Focus prevention programs on suicide prevention and bullying. 
• Strategy 3:   Create support for building the capacity  of the mental health system to serve 
infants and toddlers, young children, and adolescents.  Ensure that families/caregivers, providers, and others are informed of avail ability of services and programs in order for 
them to recognize issues, use early identification opportunities, and seek help. 
• Strategy 4:   Look at existing public awareness packages (e.g. public awareness 
packages provided by the federal Substanc e Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration (SAMSHA) and the Mental Health Association for Community Mental 
Health Awareness Week) to determi ne if we can replicate them or  utilize them in Indiana.   
o Ensure that the chosen public awarene ss campaign is based on research and 
information regarding knowledge and perceptions about areas including: stigma; importance of promoting mental health in children and adolescents; the 
prevalence of mental health disorders in  children and adolescents (including as it 
relates to youth in the juvenile justic e system and the importance of providing 
mental health treatment rather than plac ement in correctional settings); the 
factors that can cause and/or contribute to mental health disorders; the availability of services and resources among the target audience(s); and 
understanding of concepts relating to mental health versus mental illness. 
o Utilize the momentum created by the Se cond Annual Children's Mental Health 
Awareness Day, to be held May 7, 2007, sponsored by NAMI, National Federation of Families, National Association of Social Workers, National Mental 
Health Association and SAMSHA. 
• Strategy 5:   Provide policymakers with regular communication about children’s mental 
health including key aspects of the public awar eness campaign and efforts to improve the 
mental health system. Build political will ar ound the issue including identification of a 
representative for the cause. 
• Strategy 6:   Measure the impact of the public  awareness campaign on the target 
audiences (e.g., families/caregiver, educators, health and mental health providers, juvenile justice system officials) knowled ge, perceptions, and relevant behavior change.  
• Strategy 7:   Educate the public regarding the pre natal/environmental factors that can 
influence mental health for infants and toddlers and the risk factors that predispose an 
individual to mental illness. 
• Strategy 8:  Educate children about mental health and promote social, behavioral, and 
emotional health through wellness programming. 
• Strategy 9:   Promote parents teaching parents as a significant opportunity for public 
awareness and education.  Several programs in this regard exist and are of proven value.   
• Strategy 10:   Develop a plan for ongoing strategies to support and sustain the public 
awareness campaign efforts.  
 - 27 - 
 
• Strategy 11:   Celebrate successes by telling positi ve stories as personal experience is 
the most powerful connection. 
 
Process 
The goal of developing a process an d creating procedures to assist a child and the child's family 
in obtaining necessary services to treat social, emotional, and mental health issues is of pressing 
concern for the State of Indiana.  This is also a national concern.  In its Interim Report to the 
President , the President’s New Freedom Commission stated that “…the mental health delivery 
system is fragmented and in disarray…leading  to unnecessary and costly disability, 
homelessness, school failure and incarceration41.”  The report described unmet needs and 
barriers to care, including gaps and fragmentat ion in mental health care for children.  
 
Indiana has many services available for children wi th mental health concerns but the system is 
difficult to navigate.  Indiana first needs to i dentify the gaps in the existing services and then 
create a point of entry into the sy stem that is easy to understand.   
Public Awareness 
The goal of developing a public awareness campaign to reduce the stigma of mental illness, 
educate families, the general public and other key audiences about the importance of social, 
emotional and behavioral health development is a key recommendation.  When the public is 
informed about mental illness they are less lik ely to stigmatize it and more likely to seek 
treatment.   
 
Indiana needs to have a public awareness campaign based on research and information 
regarding knowledge and perceptions about the fo llowing areas: stigma; importance of promoting 
mental health in children and adolescents; the pr evalence of mental health disorders in children 
and adolescents (including as it relates to youth in the juvenile justice system and the importance 
of providing mental health treatment rather than placement in correctional settings); the factors 
that can cause and/or contribute to mental health  disorders; the availability of services and 
resources among the target audience(s); and underst anding of concepts relating to mental health 
versus mental illness.  This list is not intended to be all inclusive.  It is important to note that the 
recommendation does not necessarily involve I ndiana creating its own public awareness 
campaign.  Existing public awareness packages should be reviewed to determine if Indiana can 
replicate the campaign and/or use it in Indiana.   
Next Steps 
The first step in developing a public awareness campaign is to develop an action agenda and an 
operational business plan.  This can be accomp lished through a cross-agency team/interagency 
coordinating council established specifically to develop the action agenda and oversee its 
implementation.   
 
This cross-agency team should be charged with (1) development of public service announcements (using multiple types of media) that  raise public awareness of the importance of 
recognizing child development issues includi ng social, emotional, behavioral development; (2) 
development of general educational materials to pr imary  medical care physicians and hospitals, 
child serving organizations, educational progra ms, parent groups, etc. regarding "normal 
development" and signs of potential need to seek screening or assessment; (3) development of 
more specific materials about specific disorders or challenges of childhood and where to seek 
assistance; (4) other materials as requir ed or determined by the cross-agency team.

Early Learning Foundations and Indiana Academic 
Standards 
 
Recent research points to public schools as t he major providers of mental health services for 
school-aged children.  According to the report, School Mental Health Services in the United 
States 2002-2003, more than 80 percent of schoo ls provided assessment for mental health 
problems, behavior management consultation, and cr isis intervention, as well as referrals to 
specialized programs. A majority also provided individual and group counseling and case 
management.  Findings from this report indicate that schools are responding to the mental health 
needs of their students but there is an increasing n eed for mental health services.  Schools face 
multiple challenges in addressing these needs.  The report also indicates that further research is 
needed to explore issues identified by the study , including training of school staff delivering 
mental health services, adequacy of funding, and effectiveness of specific services delivered in 
the school setting42. 
 
Indiana Academic Standards have been developed from kindergarten through twelfth grade to 
promote excellence and equity in education.  The standards provide a framew ork of the essential 
content every student needs in order to have a basis for understanding each subject area at each 
grade level and can be found at http://www.doe.state.in.us/standards/welcome.html .  The 
Foundations to the Academic Standards for children birth to five are aligned to the Academic Standards.  The Foundations outline specific early childhood skills and concepts in a developmentally appropriate perspective and give ex amples of instructional strategies that 
support teachers, parents, and caregivers as  they develop the types of experiences and 
interactions early learners need to develop ea ch foundation.  They can be found at 
http://www.doe.state.in.us/ primetime/welcome.html#1 . 
 
Beginning a birth, children’s social and emoti onal development is an essential component to 
school readiness and academic achievement.  Resear ch indicates that critical foundations for 
learning, school success, and general well-being  occur long before a child enters kindergarten43.  
When children’s social and emotional development and mental health concerns are not 
addressed early, the cost to families and the Stat e increases.  When an adult such as a teacher, 
caregiver, parent, family member, or service prov ider engages in interactions that help the young 
child develop strong interpersonal relationships and social and emotional skills, more intensive interventions later on in life will be reduced. For young children, early childhood mental health is 
healthy social and emotional development
44. Early childhood is a critical period for the onset of 
emotional and behavior impairments.  President  Bush’s New Freedom Commission on Mental 
Health Report, Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America includes a 
recommendation for early detection of mental health problems45. 
 
Schools play a central role in promoting child ren’s social and emotional development because 
most children ages 5-18 attend school, and because social and emotional well-being is integral to 
children’s ability to learn and succeed in school. By  integrating an emphasis on social-emotional 
learning in schools, students are better able to resolve interpersonal problems and prevent antisocial behavior, as well as to achieve positive academic outcomes. 
 
"In this era of accountability and school refo rm, the mental health community should be aware 
that their interventions must align with the majo r concern of the schools academic achievement.  
Likewise, the education community must be awar e that mental health professionals do have

strategies to improve instruct ion and achievement as well as improving social and emotional 
function in children.  The convergence of these two perspectives is the hallmark of "school-based 
mental health46." 
Goals and Strategies 
 
Goal:  YOUNG CHILDREN BEGINNING AT BIRTH:  Incorporate the social and emotional 
development of young children as a critical comp onent to the development of the whole child and 
the well-being of families. 
 
• Strategy 1:   Provide parents and families with learning opportunities related to the 
importance of their children’s social and emotional development. 
• Strategy 2:   Train mental health providers, health care service providers, social service 
agencies, and public school preschool programs for children with/without disabilities on 
appropriate social and emotional competencies. 
• Strategy 3:   Develop and strengthen parent education and support services for all 
parents of young children, espe cially new and at-risk parents. 
• Strategy 4:   Review developmental screening prac tices across early childhood programs 
and health care services.  Provide consultation and training to individuals conducting 
screenings to ensure an appropriate and cu lturally competent assessment of young 
children’s social and emotional development with the use of a standardized tool. 
• Strategy 5:  Assure earlier identification and intervention of mental health disorders in 
infants and toddlers and young ch ildren by providing practitioners with mental health 
consultation and training to increase their capacity to identify and assist families with 
infants and young children whose behavior has begun to deviate from the normal range 
of development. 
 
Goal:   STUDENT SERVICES:  Increase focus on requirements and allowances within 511 IAC 4-
1.5 (Article IV).  Use this language to better identify and effectively gui de provision of student 
assistance services to children in Indiana schools including prevention, assessment, referral, and 
intervention services. 
• Strategy 1:   Revisit the ratio of student services  personnel as outlined in Article IV (511 
IAC 4-1.5-2).  Examine the fiscal im pact of changes to the ratios. 
o (b) The following ratios are recommended for providing student services: 
(1) For elementary educational and career services, one (1) school counselor for 
every six hundred (600) students enrolled in grades 1 through 6 in the 
corporation. 
(2) For secondary school educational and career services, one (1) school counselor for every three hundred (300) students enrolled in grades 7 through 12 in the corporation. 
(3) For student assistance services, one (1) school counselor, school psychologist, or master’s level school social worker for every seven hundred 
(700) students enrolled in the corporation. 
(4) For health services, one (1) regist ered nurse for every seven hundred fifty 
(750) students enrolled in the corporation.  
• Strategy 2:   Encourage policies that make the best use of student service providers, i.e., 
they should be used for student assistance and not clerical or administrative tasks. 
• Strategy 3:   Change wording in Article IV to “shall” instead of “should”.  Examine the 
fiscal impact of the proposed changes.  Refer to the following sections: 
o 511 IAC 4-1.5-4 Sec.4.(b) – "should provide" to "shall" 
o 511 IAC 4-1.5-8 Sec.8.(a) – “may be” to “shall”

• Strategy 4:   Frequently there is no comprehensiv e, cohesive and consistent method of 
student service delivery.  Develop a proces s for student services including funding.  
• Strategy 5:   Increase the provision of student se rvice delivery in the early grades when 
interventions could be most effective. 
• Strategy 6:   Encourage schools to identify a staff person or team to: serve as liaison to 
families and community agencies; define roles and functions of personnel providing 
support services to avoid duplication of services; establish appropriate referral 
mechanisms for students with social, emot ional and mental health needs; develop a 
network of community resources that meet student needs; and educate students and families about the availability of school-based and school-linked mental health services.   
 
Goal:   SCHOOLS:  Incorporate the social and emot ional development of children as an integral 
component to the mission of schools, critical  to the development of the whole child, and 
necessary to academic readiness and school success. 
• Strategy 1:   Link evidence to outcomes through demonstration projects in schools. 
• Strategy 2:   Establish formal partnerships between schools and community mental 
health providers to support families and caregivers.  Establish guidelines for schools on 
how to develop partnerships with diverse community agencies, including non-traditional 
organizations, to ensure a comprehensive, coordinated approach to addressing children’s mental health, and social and emotional development.    
o Develop partnerships between CMHC services and schools with a focus on 
mental wellness, not illness. 
• Strategy 3:   Maximize Medicaid funding for schools. 
• Strategy 4:   Work with local school districts, educators, and others to ensure 
implementation of school policies and administra tive procedures that promote social and 
emotional development. 
• Strategy 5:   Help schools develop a process for a s ystem of triage.  Disseminate sample 
policies and administrative procedures to gui de development of policies for incorporating 
social and emotional development into educational programs as well as protocols (i.e., guidelines) for responding to children with social, emotional, and mental health problems. 
• Strategy 6:   Support DCS in order to prevent  child abuse and neglect by making 
appropriate referrals to community based agencie s when children and/or parents indicate 
they need assistance. 
o Develop process for referrals by trained mental health professionals to 
appropriate services. 
• Strategy 7:   Educate parents about options.  Pa rents may be unaware of their rights 
regarding the legislation governing access to mental health services in schools (Section 
504, Article 7, Article 4). 
• Strategy 8:   Recommend that school districts, schools, and other relevant entities 
implement policies, programs, and services  that support social and emotional 
competencies, promote mental health, and pr event risky behaviors (e.g., substance 
abuse, violence). 
• Strategy 9:   Develop and enhance mentoring programs. 
• Strategy 10:   Strengthen advisor/advisee programs at the middle school level. 
• Strategy 11:   Provide professional development to school personnel, including 
administrative, academic, and staff, in soci al and emotional comp etencies and learning 
standards and how to integrate them across disciplines.  Train schools on restructuring 
systems to include multidis ciplinary assessment, interv ention teams, PBIS, GEI, and SAP 
Core Teams. 
• Strategy 12:  Promote opportunities for multi-disciplinary school personnel (e.g., social 
workers, psychologists and counselors, school nurses) to develop consistent protocols 
and coordinated approaches for providing mental health services in schools (i.e., 
prevention, early intervention, and treatment) for children ages 3 -22.   
• Strategy 13:   Develop and support a common language. 
• Strategy 14:   Strengthen partnerships and increase communication so every party 
 - 31 - 
 
shares in the continuum of care.  The school doesn’t own the issue; it is a community 
issue and res ponsibility. 
• Strategy 15:   Teachers and school staff should be trained as part of the mental health 
services system. Involve parents and families in in-service training and planning of training for teachers. 
 
Goal:   TRAINING AND CURRICULUM:  Ensure dev elopment and implementation of a plan to 
incorporate social emotional learning standards as part of the Indiana Academic Standards. 
• Strategy 1:   Support dissemination and training efforts on the Foundations to the 
Academic Standards for families and early childhood practitioners that interact with children from birth to age five.  
• Strategy 2:   Teach social skills in the early years.   Enhance curriculum at the elementary 
level.   
• Strategy 3:   Improve and strengthen guidance curriculum at middle and high school 
levels. 
• Strategy 4:   More effectively integrate social and emotional learning competencies into 
existing academic standards and standards delivery. 
Young Children Beginning At Birth 
The emotional and social competence of young children is a strong predictor of academic 
performance in elementary school.  Social and emotional development is just as important as 
literacy, language, and number skills in ens uring young children are ready for school47. 
Infants can experience real depression as early as 4 months of age48.  An Illinois study found that 
42% of child care programs asked families to wi thdraw their infants and toddlers because of 
social-emotional problems49.  Indiana early care and education providers frequently identify 
training on addressing challenging behaviors as a priority training need.  Infant and early 
childhood mental health must be integrated into all child-related services and systems.  Cost-benefit analyses confirm that providing young child ren with social, emotional and behavioral skills 
through quality early educational experiences produces an economic return to society
50.  Children 
with healthy social and emotional skills are capable of developing lasting friendships and intimate relationships, effectively caring for their own children, holding a job, and becoming productive 
citizens
51.   
Student Services 
The broad goal of increasing the focus on requir ements and allowances within the rule for 
Student Services will allow better use of the lang uage to identify and effectively guide provision of 
student assistance services to children in I ndiana schools including prevention, assessment, 
referral, and intervention services.  Student assistan ce services (511 1AC 4-1.5-5) are required to 
address those barriers to learning which im pede a student from accomplishing academic 
success. Certified school  counselors, school psychologists and school social workers are to 
provide prevention, assessment, intervention and referral services in a comprehensive and 
coordinated manner. Such services will promote the social, emotional and behavioral health of students. Needs assessments are to be conducte d at the macro (school, community) and micro 
(student, family) levels. Assess ment results will prompt timely and best-practice interventions 
which may include individual/group counseling and/or referral to a community resource.

Schools 
It is important for schools to incorporate the social and emotional development of children as an 
integral component to their mission.  Social and emotional development is critical to the 
development of the whole child and necessary to  academic readiness and school success.  
Mental health is primarily discussed as if the term were synonymous with problems (e.g., 
emotional disturbance, violence, and substance ab use) thereby countering efforts to pursue the 
school’s role in promoting positive social and emotional development52.   
 
According to the Mental Health in Schools:  Guidelines, Models, Resources, & Policy 
Considerations report the well-being of young people can be substantially enhanced by 
addressing key policy concerns in the school se tting. In this respect, policy must be developed 
around well-conceived models and the best availabl e information. Policy must be realigned to 
create a cohesive framework and must connect in major ways with the mission of schools. Attention must be directed at restructuring t he education support programs and services that 
schools own and operate.  School owned resources and community owned resources must come 
together into comprehensive, integrated approaches for addressing problems and enhancing 
healthy development. In doing all this, more must be done to involve families and to connect the 
resources of schools, neighborhoods, a nd institutions of higher education
53. 
 
Training and Curriculum 
Nationwide, schools have begun to direct resources to school-wide and/or curriculum-based programs intended to reach the broader student population, not just those individual students 
identified with mental health problems.  M any schools have curriculum-based programs and 
classroom guidance to enhance social and emotional functioning. Topics for such programs can include anger management, prevention of violence an d bullying, conflict resolution, resisting peer 
pressure, communication skills, substance abuse, and character education (e.g., developing 
citizenship skills, responsibilit y, honesty, fairness, patience)
54.   
 
In Indiana, it is important to ensure development  and implementation of a plan to incorporate 
social emotional learning standards as part of the Indiana Academic Standards.  School curricula 
incorporating social skills training and activities of daily living has been identified as a critical part 
of preparation for transition to independent living.   
Next Steps 
Senate Enrolled Act 529 Chapter 16 (IC 20-19-5) ca lls for guidelines for incorporating social, 
emotional, and behavioral development into school le arning standards and education programs.  
Because the goals and strategies outlined in this se ction are complicated, the recommendation is 
that a subcommittee be formed with the Indiana Department of Education as an integral member 
agency to explore each of the strategies listed.  Th is includes early care and education as well as 
school-aged education.

Workforce Development and Training 
 
The report from the President’s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health  in 2003 described 
the need for “significant changes in practice models and in the organization of services to improve 
access, quality and outcomes in mental health.”  The Commission recognized that substantial 
changes are needed in both who does the work in mental health and how that work is done 
(President’s New Freedom Commission). 
 
Workforce issues, including training for the deliv ery of mental health services for children and 
adolescents, are particularly critical for many reasons.  Children and adolescents change 
constantly as they grow through largely predictabl e developmental stages.  Their mental health 
needs are complex and because children and adolescents live in families a “whole family” 
approach is needed for services and supports to be effective.  In addition, children and 
adolescents with mental health needs often interact with multiple service systems55 making it 
difficult to combine services across systems. 
 
SEA529 Chapter 16 (IC 20-19-5)  calls for the plan to make recommendations on how to maintain and expand the workforce to provide mental health  services for individuals from birth through 
twenty-two (22) years of age and families; and how employers of mental health professionals may 
improve employee job satisfaction; and retain employees. 
Indiana Child Mental Heal th Workforce Statistics 
The following information includes statistics on the child mental health workforce in Indiana.  
There is no available data to determine the number of mental health professionals with specific 
child and adolescent mental health training, thes e statistics represent the workforce for mental 
health overall.

Indiana Specific Issues 
A federal Children's Mental Health Care Relief Act (S537/HR1106) has been introduced to 
increase the number of well trained mental health se rvice professionals (including those based in 
schools) by providing incentives such as payi ng educational loans and awarding scholarships to 
students who are prospe ctive professionals. 
 
While Indiana continues to experience a shortage of child mental health professionals, a new 
workforce is being developed.  Parents, caregivers  and family members of children with serious 
emotional, behavioral challenges are being identified as an important resource to other families. 
Several Systems of Care sites provide families enter ing their system with family mentors.  These 
mentors offer support and share the knowledge they have gained through their experiences.  This linkage can be a critical piece in supporting families and caregivers as they negotiate the 
challenges and complexities of caring for a child with exceptional needs.  
 
Family support groups are developing throughout the state to offer support, guidance and respite 
for families with challenged children. Families an d caregivers can offer exceptional insight to 
policy making bodies, however, their participation in policy setting is often blocked by lack of 
transportation, child care and incurred expenses . Resources need to be deployed to overcome 
these barriers and to acknowledge their valuable input.  
Goals and Strategies 
Goal:  RECRUITMENT (BUILD NEW CAPACITY):  Bu ild a culturally-competent, qualified and 
adequately trained workforce with a sufficient number of professionals to serve children and their families, as well as develop natural supports and tap into the core competencies of families and 
caregivers.  
• Strategy 1:  Encourage and expand partnerships with universities to recruit students 
enrolled in social work programs into the mental health field. 
o Expand the Department of Child Services (DCS)  Indiana Partnership for Social 
Work Education in Child Welfare.  The goal is to enhance regional social work 
programs to offer courses that reinfo rce the DCS core staff competencies, 
develop an available resource of qualified BSW graduates for Family Case Manager positions, and to reduce the recidivism rate of new hires through university educational experience and practical experience offered at DCS 
offices.  
o Increase resources for those who want to further their education in the mental 
health area.  
• Strategy 2:  Identify barriers in Indiana that prev ent a more diverse workforce from 
entering the children’s mental health field.  
• Strategy 3:  Increase  the capacity of early care and education programs to promote 
social and emotional development and serve the mental health needs of children and their families.  Explore training early care  and education provider s (licensed and legally 
license exempt) about early childhood social-emotional development and children’s 
mental health and offer mental health consultation to providers. 
o Include training on early identification. 
o Build upon the work of Head Start, First Steps, public school special education 
services, Healthy Families, Parents as  Teachers, and Building Strong Families. 
o Develop consensus on competencies to be included in early childhood social-emotional development training.  
o Maximize opportunities to offer mental health consultation to early care and 
education professionals.  
• Strategy 4:  Boost training of school staff for i dentification of social, emotional and 
behavioral need of students.  
• Strategy 5:  Determine the number of higher learning institutions that offer coursework 
and specialized tracks in early childhood mental health within psychology, clinical social 
 - 36 - 
 
work, and other counseling programs.  Review the university curriculum (long-term 
strategy) and make recommendations for inform ation that should be included in formal 
education.  
• Strategy 6:  Build and strengthen efforts that use video technology for training purposes 
particularly to underserved areas of the state including web-based distance learning for 
natural support caregivers.  
• Strategy 7:  Focus on on-site training, consultation and monitoring including 
personalized coaching. 
• Strategy 8:   Focus training on prevention with less focus on remediation including 
common sense parenting training and training of community partners for child safety in 
each of the 18 identified DCS regions.   
• Strategy 9:   Promote training for community health workers for public health (for 
example, prenatal care coordination).   Some services are reimbursable. 
• Strategy 10:   Develop incentives to attract professionals and paraprofessionals, 
particularly those from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented groups to enter the 
mental health field.   
o Encourage service for underserved populations and in underserved areas.   
o Encourage recruitment of Spanish speaking professionals. 
o Encourage use of professional guilds for this promotion, including but not limited 
to the American Academy of Pediatrics, Professional Nurse Practitioners, and the 
American Academy of Family Physicians. 
• Strategy 11:   Work with the academic community to recruit behavioral health 
professionals. 
• Strategy 12:   Use the evidence base of effective behavioral health interventions in 
training. 
• Strategy 13:   Develop a finite capacity for those who have experience in the mental 
health system (such as peers, family me mbers, and mentors) to be providers. 
• Strategy 14:   Promote careers in children’s mental health at the high school level. Many 
high schools are moving toward the concept of “small learning communities” focused on 
a particular career track. 
• Strategy 15:   Increase the focus on an d availability of vocational training for increasing 
employment opportunities for individuals intere sted in pursuing careers in mental health 
services. 
 
Goal:   RETENTION:  MAINTAIN AND INCREASE EXI STING CAPACITY:  Increase the capacity 
of existing programs and providers who work with children (e.g., early childhood, health care, education, families, mental health, education, child welfare, juvenile justice) to promote and 
support the social and emotional development and mental health needs of children and their 
families. 
• Strategy 1:   Promote cross-training and collaboration between disciplines and agencies 
(mental health, substance use, child welfare, juvenile justice, schools, Medicaid, and primary healthcare) with a common family theme. 
• Strategy 2:   Promote programs staffed by qualifi ed mental health professionals including: 
psychiatrists, psychologis ts, counselors, and social workers in juvenile 
detention/confinement. 
• Strategy 3:   Base credentialing on education and experience. 
• Strategy 4:   Look at non-traditional ways to obtain training (especially for the de-facto 
mental health workers including pediatricians, nurses, and primary care physicians). 
o Need to leverage family knowledge and experience. 
• Strategy 5:   Promote training for better dialog between pediatricians, primary care 
settings, and parents.  When a child’s developmental levels are off course these groups 
need to participate in a discussion (for ex ample, the Bright Futures curriculum, 
www.brightfutures.org). 
• Strategy 6:   Need an identified workforce for referrals once a problem is identified.  
Develop a resource guide for parents, schools and mental health workers. 
 - 37 - 
 
• Strategy 7:   Need appropriate and ad equate supervision of existi ng mental health staff. 
o Must have adequate number of supervisors across all agencies and train them 
properly. 
• Strategy 8:   Increase resources to support existing initiatives. 
• Strategy 9:   Expand Indiana’s existing specialized technical assistance, training, and 
educational infrastructure to train and retain individuals in the mental health field. 
• Strategy 10:   Develop the capacity of school syst ems and school administrators and staff 
to promote social and emotional developm ent and serve the mental health needs of 
children and their families. 
• Strategy 11:   Use the evidence base of effective behavioral health interventions in 
retention. 
• Strategy 12:   Work with the Bureau of Health Ca re Professionals to assure that all 
mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, register in the county or counties 
where they practice as opposed to  the counties where they reside. 
• Strategy 13:   Increase resources for those who w ant to further their education in the 
mental health area. 
o Outline a career path for those in the mental health field so they are more 
inclined to stay in the discipline. 
 
Goal:  TRAINING:  Train frontline providers in a co re team environment on the development and 
implementation of a tiered intervention approach in order to provide a continuum of care.   
• Strategy 1:  Engage professional organizations in ed ucating new frontline providers in 
various systems (e.g., teachers, families,  physicians, nurses,  hospital emergency 
personnel, early care and education providers, probation offi cers, school staff, and other 
child healthcare providers).  
• Strategy 2:  Train and educate mental health prov iders about scientifically-proven 
prevention and treatment services in the framework of effective practice. 
• Strategy 3:   Train professionals on all services available in Indiana through Indiana’s 
existing network of resources.   
• Strategy 4:   Train providers on the basics of mental health through the use of 
professional guilds.  (This should be included in the public awareness campaign.)   
o Encourage professional guilds for mental health specialists (e.g., psychiatry, 
psychology, social work and nursing) to require training in mental health for children. 
• Strategy 5:   Facilitate training of providers by bui lding knowledge in the following areas: 
o Systems of care 
o Portal to services 
o Tiered interventions 
o Effective interventions 
o Effective practice 
o Outcome based supervision - supervisors use data 
o Children’s mental health issues and implications for their ability to function in 
school 
¾ Resilience/recovery for kids 
¾ Special education and eligibility categories 
¾ Course of the illness and interventions 
o Positive behavioral supports 
o Share models of success 
o Resilience 
o Parenting skills 
o Evaluation of services received

Recruitment 
Recruitment is defined as the process of adding new individuals to the pool of existing mental 
health providers.  It is important to build a culturally-competent, qualified and adequately trained 
workforce with a sufficient number of profes sionals to serve children and their families. 
 
Families are increasingly involved as partners with professionals in care planning for their 
children.  Families are co nsidered the “silent army” waiting to partner with profes sional providers 
in mental health care for their children56.  Partnerships with families is not readily understood or 
accepted by some professionals, however th is must be addressed when considering the 
recruitment of new individuals to the pool of existing mental health providers.  
Retention 
Retention is defined as keeping individuals who wo rk in mental health employed as mental health 
service providers.  The challenges of retaining people in the children’s mental health workforce 
are complicated by the fluid nature of the workforce and the fact that mental health care for 
children is often addressed by multiple systems including but not limited to, primary health care, 
child protection, education, and juvenile justice.   Often, frontline workers in child welfare, 
childcare, education or juvenile justice are not considered part of the mental health workforce57. 
 
In order to effectively retain this broad spectrum  of children’s mental health care workers from all 
fields, it is important to increase the capacity of existing programs and providers who work with 
children to promote and support the social and em otional development and mental health needs 
of children and their families. 
Training 
Education and training programs often do not keep pace with the policy and practice changes in 
delivery of services to children and families.  Many in the children’s mental health field are 
concerned that pre-service academic training does not prepare students for the changing models of service delivery or for actual work in communi ties.  The concern extends to a lack of training on 
the comprehensive approaches necessary to meet the needs of families.  In order to prepare 
human service workers for the changing role they  must play, education must align with mental 
health reforms
58.   
 
Workforce development initiatives must train ne w providers and re-train existing providers to 
improve their ability to provide effective community -based care.  A much larger set of people must 
be trained to take on new roles including paraprofessionals, family members, home- and school-
based staff, pre-school staff, and early childhood consultants59. 
Next Steps 
SEA529 Chapter 16 (IC 20-19-5)  calls for the plan to make recommendations on how to maintain and expand the workforce to provide mental health  services for individuals from birth through 
twenty-two (22) years of age and families; and how employers of mental health professionals may 
improve employee job satisfaction; and retain employees.  Because the goals and strategies 
outlined in this section are complicated, the recommendation is that a subcommittee be formed 
with the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (IDWD) as an integral member agency to 
explore each of the strategies listed.

programs serving Indiana children 
 
The Interagency Team took an inventory of public systems, services, and programs serving 
Indiana children.  The inventory lists agencies a nd the programs and mental health services 
offered. The intent of the inventory is to show what Indiana currently offers to use as a benchmark 
for improvement. 
Health Insurance for Children 
 
Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (A part of Hoosier Healthwise) 
Agency:  Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning – Fam ily Social Services Administration (FSSA) 
Ages served:   birth-18  
Mission:   CHIP offers health care cove rage to eligible children a ges 0-18 whose family income 
is between 150%-200% of the federal poverty le vel (FPL).  As part of the Federal Balanced 
Budget Act of 1997, Congress created the Children's  Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as a way 
to encourage states to provide health insurance to uninsured children.    
Specific covered mental health services include:  Inpatient and outpatient mental health and 
substance abuse services are covered when the services are medically necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the member’s condition in the same manner as Hoosier Healthwise 
below except for the following limitations:  1) Inpat ient services are not covered when provided in 
a institution for mental diseases with more than 16 beds.  2) Outpatient office visits are limited to 
a maximum of 30 per rolling twelve months per member without prior approval for a maximum of 
50 visits per year.  3) Reimbursement is not av ailable for reservation of beds in psychiatric 
hospitals and 4) Community mental health rehabilitat ion services are not covered by the program.  
Funding: [*education, state, county]: Title XXI and dedicated state funds; $73 million federal; 
$30 million state.

Agency: Indiana Department of Education  
Ages served: 3-21 
Mission:  Special education and related services are provided to students identified in 
accordance with Article 7 as having a disability and who by reason of the disability require special 
education and related services. Student with a di sability means a student who has been identified 
as having a disability listed in Article 7 and wh o needs special education and related services 
because of that disability.  Special education is  specially designed instruction, provided at no cost 
to the parent, and designed to meet the uni que needs of a student who has been determined 
eligible for special education serv ices. Related services are services, such as physical therapy, 
counseling, or transportation, that are designed to supplement the student's instructional program 
and are necessary for the student to benefit from special education. Article 7 is based on the 
federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA '97) and the federal regulations. It is 
made up of 15 rules describing how special education and related services are to be determined 
and provided by Indiana's public schools.  Rule 26 lists  the eligibility categories and the criteria for 
each category. The eligibility categories for specia l education and related services include: autism 
spectrum disorder; communication disorder; deaf-blind; developmental delay (early childhood); emotional disability; hearing impairment; learning disability; mental disability; multiple disabilities; 
orthopedic impairment; other health impairment; traumatic brain injury; visual impairment. 
Specific covered mental health services include:  Article 7 defines emotional disability 
eligibility criteria as a condition that over  a long period of time and to a marked degree 
consistently interferes with the student’s educational performance.  An emotional disability may 
include a tendency to develop physical symptoms  of fears associated with personal or school 
problems; a general pervasive mood of unhappine ss or depression; an inability to learn that 
cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or health factors; an inability to build or maintain 
satisfactory interpersonal relationships; and in appropriate behaviors or feelings under normal 
circumstances (511 IAC 7-26-6(a)).  The case  conference committee (CCC) is the group of 
individuals, including school personnel and the parent s, that decides whether a student is eligible 
for special education, and if eligible, decides what  special education and related services will be 
provided, based on the student's needs.  For those children deemed eligible for special education 
services, the CCC develops a written plan called an individualized education program (IEP) which describes the special education and related services to  be provided to a student with a disability.

Appendix D:  Areas of Concern in Indiana Based on 
Public Comment 
Note:  There are several areas of concern in  Indiana listed in this plan including suicide, 
incarceration and suspensions and expulsions.  These subjects have been identified as particular 
areas of concern through the public forum process fo r the development of this plan.  This is in no 
way intended to minimize the importance of ot her concerns related to social, emotional and 
behavioral health for children. 
Children Who Are Abused or Neglected 
Child abuse and neglect continues to be a serious ar ea of concern in Indiana. The Department of 
Child Services “Child Abuse and Neglect State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2004 Annual Fatality Report” 
states that there were 57 abuse and neglect fata lities substantiated in SFY 2004, which reflects 
an increase of 6 deaths (12%) from SFY 2003 whic h reported 51 substantiated fatalities. Of the 
57 fatalities, 22 (39%) were due to abuse and 35 (61%) were due to neglect60. 
 
Over the last five years, over one child per week  has died due to child maltreatment in Indiana61.  
 
The Child Abuse and Neglect Summary by Count y SFY 2003 reports the number of children with 
substantiated abuse at 8,060, 4,440 of whom were victims of sexual abuse and 3,620 of whom 
were victims of physical abuse.  12,308 children were reported to be victims of substantiated neglect
62. 
 
Prevent Child Abuse Indiana identifies several char acteristics of communities  that take prevention 
seriously: 
 Support parents and caregivers before there is a crisis.  
 Provide primary prevention activities and pr ograms for all parents regardless of ethnic, 
cultural, racial or economic backgrounds because they understand that child abuse and neglect happens in all segments of our communities. 
 Invest in prevention because they understand t hat their investment will ultimately reduce 
juvenile delinquency rates, drug and alcohol  abuse, domestic violence and crime. 
 Understand that prevention requires leadership  and involvement from all sectors of the 
community including civic, business, educ ation, clergy, health and human services. 
 Understand that preventing child abuse and neglect is everyone’s problem63. 
Suicide  
Suicide is a serious public health challenge that  has not received the attention and degree of 
national priority it deserves. Many Americans are unaware of suicide’s toll and its global impact. It 
is the leading cause of violent deaths worldwi de, outnumbering homicide or war-related deaths64.  
One of the most distressing and preventable cons equences of undiagnosed, untreated or under-
treated mental illnesses is suicide. 
 
In the U.S., suicide claims approximately 30,000 lives each year. Overall, suicide was the 11th 
leading cause of death among Americans in 2000.  In 1999, more than 152,000 hospital admissions and more than 700,000 visits to hos pital emergency rooms were for self-harming 
behaviors.  The vast majority of all people who die by suicide have a mental illness, often

undiagnosed or untreated65.  Suicide was also the fourth leading cause of death among youth 
aged 10-14, third among those between 15 and 24, second among 25- to 34-year olds, and fourth 
among those 35-44 years in 1999.  The rate of teen suicide (for those from ages 15 to 19) has 
tripled since the 1950s66.  According to the Indiana State Department of Health, suicide is the 
third leading cause of death for young people in Indiana  ages 12 to 22, third only after accidents 
and homicide.  In addition, the most recent I ndiana State Department of Health Youth Risk 
Behavior Survey reports that in 2005 almost 1 in 5 Indiana youth had seriously considered 
attempting suicide (18% overall, 22% of girls and 14.3% of boys)67. 
 
Given that the vast majority of those who die by  suicide give warning signs prior to their death, 
the tragedy of suicide is preventable if we kn ow how to recognize warning signs and get 
distressed youth the help they need and build resilienc y/coping skills so that distressed youth are 
able to seek help themselves.  There are a variet y of suicide prevention education programs that 
have been proven effective at ra ising awareness of suicide and reducing suicidal behavior. 
 
There are three approaches to suicide prevention that are commonly accepted: case finding (with 
appropriate referral and treatment);  risk factor reduction; and building or promoting protective 
factors.  Ideally all three sh ould be addressed when conducting suicide prevention activities. 
Case finding strategies include: school-based suicide awareness curricula, screening, gatekeeper 
training, and community crisis centers and hotlin es. Risk factor reduction strategies include: 
restricting lethal means to suicide (e.g., guns), media education on proper reporting of suicides, postvention (helping survivors after a loss due to suicide) and crisis intervention
68. Support 
groups for survivors (people who have lost loved o nes to suicide) are also helpful in risk factor 
reduction as survivors are at increased risk of su icide themselves. Promotion of protective factors 
commonly includes skills training related to problem solving, self-esteem, decision making, 
conflict resolution, anger management, and help-se eking skills. Data show that building these 
skills can help reduce risk behaviors, including suicidal behaviors69. 
 
Universal strategies for youth suicide preventi on are usually implemented in schools and youth 
serving organizations, as well as with parents. Se lective strategies are typically implemented in 
schools, youth serving organization s, juvenile justice centers, gr oup homes, physicians’ offices, 
emergency departments, mental health facilities, and crisis centers. Indicated strategies are 
typically implemented in youth serving organizati ons, juvenile justice centers, mental health 
centers, physicians’ offices, and crisis centers/lin es.  A number of these strategies are currently 
being implemented in Indiana or other states with success70. 
 
It should be noted that screening instruments have been developed that are confidential, 
computer based and are being broadly used with efficacy in identifying children who may be at 
risk for suicide or have other mental health issues.  In one study, Shaffer71 noted that only 31% of 
those with major depression, 26% of those with recent suicide ideation, and 50% of those that 
had made a past suicide attempt were known by school personnel to have significant problems.  In addition, these screens have identified needed interventions that have improved adolescent 
functioning. Dr. Shaffer has found in his research that 90% of the teens that committed suicide 
had a psychiatric disorder at the time of their deaths
72.  Screening instruments for teen suicide 
prevention should be evaluated to assess the advantages and risks of broader use in Indiana.

In addition to the strategies listed in this  appendix, other sections of this plan list 
recommendations that are related to suicide prevention such as early identification and 
intervention and access to effective services.  Please refer to the sections on obtaining services 
and referral networks, early learning foundations and Indiana’s academic standards, and 
workforce development and training for more information. 
Incarceration 
Growing evidence indicates that a lack of mental hea lth care services leads to the incarceration of 
thousands of mentally ill youth each year in the United States.  St udies consistently show that 
youth in the juvenile justice systems have a mu ch higher rate of mental health needs than in the 
general population.   Experts in both the ment al health and corrections systems believe many 
children with mental disorders would be better served in the community with a range of therapies and family supports
73.   
 
The National Center for Mental Health and Juvenile Justice (
http://www.ncmhjj.com/faqs/default.asp ) identifies six key issues.   
1. There is a growing aware ness of mental health disord ers among youth in the general 
population.  About 20% of the children a nd adolescents are experiencing a mental 
disorder; about 10% experience mental ill ness severe enough to cause impairment at 
home, in school, and in the community; but less than half receive the treatment they need. 
2. The prevalence of mental disorder among y outh in the juvenile justice system is two to 
three times higher than in the general population.  Developing research indicates that anywhere from 70% to 100% of youth in the ju venile justice system are believed to have 
a 
diagnosable mental health disorder (Teplin et al, 2002; Otto et al., 1992; Virginia Policy 
Design Team, 1994; Wierson, Forehand and Fram e, 1992). About 20 percent of youth in 
the juvenile justice system have a serious mental disorder.  More than half of youth in the juvenile justice systems have co-occurring substance abuse needs
74.  
3. There is an increasing awareness and crisis surrounding the care and treatment of youth 
with mental disorders in the juvenile ju stice system nationally and in Indiana (Bar 
Association, 2006).   Over t he last ten years, attention is being given to the behavioral 
health needs of this population have been neglected for a long time.  Both the juvenile justice and mental health systems are concer ned about the criminalization of mental 
illness.  Investigations into the conditions of confinement of youth in juvenile detention 
and correctional facilities across the county c onsistently highlight the lack of appropriate 
screening, assessment and treatment for y outh, the sometimes inappropriate use of 
medication and inappropriate responses to suicide threats (DOJ, 2003). 
4. A number of factors contribute to the se nse of crisis regarding unmet behavioral health 
needs of youth in juvenile justice.  There appears to be increasing number of youth with 
mental health disorders entering the criminal justice system.  Many are incarcerated for 
minor, non-violent offenses.  Some wonder if  the system is becoming a last resort for 
many youth. 
5. In spite of these challenges, there are si gns of improvement:  the availability of new and 
effective tools and services.  Screening and assessment tools, specifically designed for youth in juvenile justice identify needs.  Such  screening tools are being used in 45 states 
and across the juvenile justice system in 28 st ates.  Structured assessments are used in 
15 states. Experts in both the mental health and correction systems believe many children with mental disorders would be better served in the community with a range of 
therapies and family supports
75.  Promising and evidence based practices offer hope and 
have documented effective positive outcomes for youth and their families.

6. Although much is happening, more needs to happen.  Policy makers need to understand 
the importance of this issue.  Diversion pr ograms are needed for youth who commit minor 
offenses. We need to push for effective comm unity-based treatment options.  Behavioral 
health screening is recommended for youth entering the juvenile justice system, and 
further evaluation, when needed.  Treatment services need to be improved for youth in 
secure facilities.  Re-entry programs for y outh transitioning out of residential care need to 
be strengthened. 
Suspension and Expulsion  
 
Indiana ranks first in the nation in its rate of school expulsions76 and ninth in out-of-school 
suspensions77 according to the latest available st atistics from the U.S. Department of 
Education.78  According to the Indianapolis Star, 28% of Indiana’s students dropout of high 
school79.  While schools must ensure safe school climat es and strive towards this goal, Indiana’s 
Child Left Behind project has found that ex pulsion and out-of-school suspensions do not 
contribute to this goal80 nor change student behavior.81  
 
The Center for Evaluation and Education Polic y (CEEP) at Indiana University Bloomington and 
the Indiana Youth Services Associ ation formed the Children Left Behind (CLB) project in 2004 to 
document the use and effects of school exclusion on students in Indiana’s schools, and to create 
a meaningful dialogue between educators, juveni le justice professionals, policymakers and 
community members on the most effective methods of school discipline.  Key findings of the CLB 
project include the following82:  
• Nationally, higher rates of out-of-school susp ensions are associated with lower achievement, 
higher dropout rates, and poorer school clim ate.  The impact of serious emotional 
disturbances (SEDs) on learning is well doc umented. Children with SEDs have the highest 
rate of school failure; only about 42 percent of these students graduate from high school, 
compared with 57 percent of all students with disabilities83.  Indiana’s dropout rate for high 
school is 28%, 48% for African American  students and 47% for Hispanic students84.  
Nationally, 80% of prisoners are dropouts, 45%  of homeless young adults are dropouts, 50% 
of heads of households on welfare are dropouts, and 40% of dropouts are not accounted for 
in US wage labor survey85.   
• Indiana schools that have higher rates of out-of-school suspensions have lower passing 
scores on ISTEP, the state’s st andardized test of achievement. 
• There is evidence of minority overrepresentation in bo th expulsion and suspension. 
• Alternatives to out-of-school suspensions and expu lsions are available.  Principals of Indiana 
are using various innovative disciplinary stra tegies to maintain school discipline and 
maximize educational opportunities.  
 
It is also important to note that in recent y ears there has been an increase in the number of 
expelled students in pre- kindergarten.  In a national pre-ki ndergarten study, pre-kindergarten 
students were expelled at a rate more than thre e times that of their older peers in the K-12 
                                                 
76 IC 20-33-8-3 defines expulsion as a disci plinary or other action whereby a stude nt is separated from school attendance 
for a period exceeding ten days.   
77 IC 20-33-8-7 defines suspensions as an y disciplinary action that does not cons titute an expulsion, where a student is 
separated from school for a period not more than ten school days.

grades.  Rates of expulsion varied widely among the 40 states funding pre-kindergarten (Indiana 
does not fund pre-kindergarten pr ograms).  In addition, pre-kinder garten expulsion rates vary by 
classroom setting.  In spite of these statistics , studies have shown that the likelihood of expulsion 
decreases significantly with access to classroom-based behavioral consultation86. 
 
An examination of Indiana’s dat a on suspension and expulsion rev ealed that the majority of 
student suspensions are in categories which do not represent the most serious infractions; over 
90% of out-of-school suspensions were accounted  for by infractions in the categories of 
“Disruptive Behavior” and “Other.”  A very sm all percentage of suspensions and even expulsions 
in Indiana occur because of the most se rious infractions—e.g., weapons and drugs.87  The 
increasing tendency to criminalize school behavior is associated with increased school dropout, 
higher levels of incarceration, and minority  overrepresentation in juvenile detention.88  Many 
communities are coming to the realization that suspension and expulsion simply shift the location 
of the problem—from disruptions in the school to crime in the streets.89
 
The CLB project data indicates substantial raci al disparities in the use of out-of-school 
suspensions and expulsions in the state, par ticularly among African American students. African 
American students are four times as likely to re ceive out-of-school suspension and about two and 
a half times as likely to be expelled as white students.  Previous studies  have found no evidence 
that such disproportionality is due to higher rates of misbehavior by minority students—if 
anything, African American students appear more likely to be suspended and expelled for more 
subjective and minor infractions. The data also revealed evidence of disproportionate 
suspensions and expulsions for Hispanic students. Th is finding is especially noteworthy, since 
this population is the fastest growing subgroup nationally and in Indiana. Together these data 
yield the disturbing conclusion that some racial/ethnic groups in Indiana are being subjected at a 
higher rate to school consequences that remove them from the opportunity to learn.90
 
In this age of accountability in our nation and state, it has become an accepted fact of school life 
to evaluate school practices in terms of thei r impact on student achievement. Thus it is 
noteworthy that statewide data show s that those schools with the highest rates of out-of-school 
suspension have lower passing rates on ISTEP than those with the lowest rates of suspension.  
The data cannot be explained as a function of high or low poverty—the negative relationship 
between a school’s use of suspension and its average ISTEP scores continues to hold when 
poverty, race, and a number of other demographic variables are controlled. Regardless of school 
demographics, schools with higher ratios of out-of-school suspension have lower average 
passing scores on ISTEP.91   
 
The Children Left Behind series made the following  recommendations for effective approaches to 
maintaining safety and discipline, and especially for increasing available options that address 
issues of student behavior: 
 
1. Reserve zero tolerance disciplinary removals for only the most serious and severe of 
disruptive behaviors, and explicitly define those behaviors. 
2. Replace one-size-fits-all disciplinary strategi es with graduated system s of discipline; scale 
consequences to the seriousness of the infraction.  
3. Improve data collection strategies on school  discipline at the state level; assist local 
educators in using disciplinary data to address their school’s safety and disciplinary needs.

4. Improve collaboration and communication among schools, parents, juvenile justice, and 
mental health to develop an array of alternatives for challenging youth.  
5. Implement preventive measur es that can improve school climate and reconnect alienated 
students.  
6. Expand the array of options available to sc hools for dealing with disruptive or violent 
behavior. In particular, ensure that teachers  receive training in classroom management 
strategies that provide them with the t ools they need for handling misbehavior at the 
classroom level.  
7. Evaluate all school discipline or school violence prevention strategies to ensure that all 
disciplinary interventions, programs, or  strategies are truly effective.  
8. Provide teacher training programs to provi de pre-service teachers the tools they need to 
address student misbehavior at the classroom level.   
 
Sections of this plan list recommendations that are related to the reduction of suspensions and 
expulsions such as a tiered plan to address general and individualized behavioral management 
issues and an assessment to inform individualized plans.  Please refer to the sections on

Appendix E:  Existing Studies Related to the Needs 
Assessment of Indiana’s Behavioral Health Network 
 
Evaluation of Systems Reform in the Annie E. Casey Foundation Mental Health Initiative 
for Urban Children: Summary of Findings and Lessons Learned.    
Authors:  Gutierrez-Mayka, M., Joseph, R., Sengov a, J., Uzzell, J., Contreras, R., Friedman, R., 
Hernandez, M. 
May 2000 
http://www.aecf.org/publications/data/mhisysref.pdf
 
In 1993, the Annie E. Casey Foundation launched t he Mental Health Initiative for Urban Children 
(MHI).  The overall goal of this five year, nei ghborhood-scale program was to improve community 
mental health services to achieve positive outco mes for children, and, in the long run, avoid 
significant public expenditures.  Specifically , the MHI sought to demonstrate new ways of 
delivering culturally appropriate, family sensitive, mental health services to children in high poverty, urban communities, and to work with states to improve the policies and practices 
supporting these services.  
 
A key aspect of the MHI design was its focus on high poverty inner-city neighborhoods. The life 
experiences of children in these communities plac es them at a much higher risk for involvement 
with systems (e.g., mental health, juvenile justic e, child welfare, special education) that are 
unprepared to give them and their families the s upport they need to succeed.  According to the 
1999 Kids Count Report produced by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, there are 9.2 million 
children nationally who are growing up with multiple risk factors including absence of a parent, low parental education, low socio-economic  status, unemployed or underemployed parents, 
welfare assistance, and lack of health insurance coverage.  A demographic look at these children 
reveals they are mostly from minority groups (i.e., 30% of all Black and 25% of all Hispanic 
children are considered at high risk ) and they live in poor central city neighborhoods.  In addition 
to the environmental stressors, in the United St ates today, increasing numbers of children are 
experiencing some type of emotional, behavioral or  developmental problem.  For children living in 
low income communities, the combination of more acute mental health problems and inadequate services results in disproportionate numbers of them spending time in foster care, special education, psychiatric hospitals, and juvenile justice facilities—all at public expense.   
 
Another key aspect of the MHI design was to targ et a broad population of children at-risk, while 
incorporating features from system reform initiati ves, specifically targeted at children with serious 
emotional disturbances and their families.  
 
The MHI’s reform agenda called for simultaneous efforts on a variety of fronts (e.g. community 
involvement and governance, service design and delivery, MIS, systems integration, and 
sustainability) making it almost impossible to  dedicate the time, energy and commitment that 
each one required to succeed.  However, clea r successes were claimed in the area of 
partnerships.  The MHI’s mixed governing entit ies modeled new types of relationships between 
state and local agencies, and neighborhood residents,  and created new networks whose potential 
impact is yet to be seen.  In terms of reforms rela ted to service delivery, the main contribution of 
the MHI is the idea that a service strategy (i.e., Family Resource Centers) which emphasizes supporting families’ basic needs for housing, em ployment, education, recreation, spirituality and 
cultural identification can be an effective mechanism to address children’s mental health needs 
and prevent their future involvement with formal systems. This idea has implications for how 
community-based mental health services are marketed and packaged, and ultimately, for the 
achievement of positive child and family outcomes. The notion that trained community residents 
can make important and unique contributions to a fa mily’s mental health is another legacy of the 
MHI.  Finally, the success in promoting polic y and fiscal reforms and in the development of 
 - 59 - 
 
management information systems (MIS) to support  the service strategy can be considered small 
compared to what the Foundation expected to see in this area. 
 
The Indiana State Bar Association, Children, Men tal Health and the Law Summit: Official 
Report on Summit Findings with Recommendations.  
Fall, 2005 
http://www.inbar.org/content/pdf/Mental Health Report%20.pdf
 
The Indiana State Bar Associatio n’s Civil Rights of Children Committee, in partnership with the 
Indiana State Bar Association (ISBA) Family and Ju venile Law Section and ISBA Criminal Justice 
Section, organized an interdisciplinary su mmit on August 27, 2004, to address concerns 
regarding the unmet mental health needs of child ren in the juvenile justice system. A lack of 
prompt identification, diagnosis and treatment of children before their mental health problems 
lead them into the juvenile justice system , and inadequate screening, assessment and care once 
they do enter the system are creating a crisis that the legal profession and others cannot ignore.   
The juvenile justice system is ill-suited, as a matter of sound public policy and children’s civil 
rights, to be the primary provider of mental health service to children.  
 
This report outlines specific recommendations d eveloped as a result of the Summit, including 
steps local communities, mental health officials and the juvenile justice system can take to 
provide appropriate services to more children with mental health needs in order to return them safely to their communities and schools, and reduce their risk of future incarcerations.  Indiana 
has made progress in these areas, but more needs to be done.  
 
Recommendations for the children with mental heal th
  needs as they enter the juvenile justice 
system: 
• Develop and implement a standardized, integr ated, statewide program for screening in 
conjunction with a validated risk assessment in strument, to treat youth upon entry of the 
juvenile justice system. 
• Safeguard youths’ constitutional right against self-incrimination through screening and 
assessment programs.  
• Divert low-risk children to  community-based treatment.  
• Educate attorneys, judges, county and local offi cials on the mental health needs of the youth 
and the benefits of prompt screening, assessment, and treatment of mental health disorders.  
• Encourage earlier intervention by us ing appropriate screening and assessment 
methodologies to detect mental health disorders of children in Child in Need of Services 
(CHINS) cases.  
• Determine and treat the mental health need s of the family when treating the child. 
• Strengthen special education advocacy within the legal community to build and support 
community-based systems of care that protec t critical rights of children and parents. 
• Reduce school expulsions and out-of-school su spensions by increasing the availability of 
prevention, early intervention, and special education alternatives. 
• Increase the use of IDEA and Medicaid entitlements to generate comprehensive community-
based mental health systems that are integrated in schools to provide mental health services 
for school-age children through early intervention efforts.  
• A collaborative, interdisciplinary committee, to be appointed by the Indiana Supreme Court, 
should recommend processes for: (1) determining competency to stand trial in juvenile 
delinquency proceedings; (2) restoring childr en to competency; and (3) determining what to 
do with children who cannot be restored.  
• An Indiana juvenile competency model should be based on the same legal standard for   
competency required in criminal court, as se t forth in Re K.G. (Court case: 808 N.E.2d 631, 
635 (Ind. 2004)). 
• Require competency evaluations, unless waived by the child’s counsel, in cases where the 
State is seeking waiver to adult criminal court. 
 - 60 - 
 
• Appoint legal counsel in every juvenile delinquency case to ensure juveniles are not 
subjected to delinquency proceedings if incompetent to stand trial. 
• Refer children incompetent to stand trial, (incompetent due to mental health issues rather 
than due to age and development) to the county offi ce of the Department of Child Services to

Indiana Consortium for Mental Health Services Research 
Sixth Annual Evaluation Briefing of the Dawn Project Evaluation Study 
Author:  Wright, E., Anderson, J. 
September 2005

ublic%20Briefing%20Report%20-%20Final.pdf
 
Since 1997, the Dawn Project has provided an in teragency system of care for youth with 
emotional and behavioral challenges and their families in Marion County.  Dawn is responsible for 
creating and maintaining a coordinated, communi ty-based system of services; developing 
supports for children and youth with the most serious emotional and behavioral challenges; and placing families at the center of decisi on-making in the provision of services.   
 
September of 2005, Eric Wright and Jeff Anderson completed a study of the impact of the Dawn 
Project on the Marion County Children’s Social Service System.  The study was conducted to 
understand how key stakeholders in the children’s service arena in Marion County perceived the 
impact that the establishment of the Dawn Proj ect had on the social services community over 
time.  To understand how the Dawn Project has impacted the community, study findings related 
to positive community level impact fell into t he following groups: increased collaboration and 
service coordination, importance of family invo lvement, lessening fiscal constraints, enhancing 
strengths approaches, and ecological responses.   
 
Data for this study were collected primarily through interviews with stakeholders—system and 
agency leaders and parents who were involved in the children’s social services system at the inception of the Dawn Project through th e first five years of its existence.

Respondents reported an increase in recognition among stakeholders that children served by the 
Dawn Project tend to be involved in many different  systems, thus making service coordination a 
useful approach.  They also reported that t he Dawn Project is helping the community become 
aware of the importance of building on family strengths by viewing the family as a resource in the 
treatment program, and by asking them what they need rather than telling them what services 
they will receive.  At the county level, traditi onal power structures have been challenged because 
of the creation of the Dawn Project, some of t he financial barriers have been “loosened,” there is 
more discussion on wraparound and the use of “flex”  funds, and that the use of costly residential 
services has been reduced and the nature of residential treatment is changing.  The Dawn Project has had an overall impact in the adoptio n, use, and proliferation of strengths-based 
approaches, and has pushed the systems to move beyond just treating children to also working 
with their environments.  Respondents also ment ioned the importance of multi-system treatment 
plans that are used to ensure that all domains of a child’s life are addressed.

Appendix F:  Glossary 
 
Active Parental Consent – The term "active parental consent" means collecting a signature 
and/or permission from the parent or guardian of each child authorizing an agency to give the 
child a screening or assessment.  
 
Child-Serving Agencies  - Addressing the needs of young people in the service population 
requires the resources of multiple public agencies, including education, mental health, child 
welfare, corrections, and juvenile justice,  along with private providers and community 
organizations (e.g., faith, family support, and youth organizations).   
 
Effective Models of Care  - Definitions of evidence-based practices (or effective models of care) 
have been developed by many national organizati ons, including the Institute of Medicine92 and 
American Psychological Association93.  Additionally, states, such as Hawaii94, have created 
definitions of effective models of care that reflect the values of their system of care.  The 
importance of effective models of care in a tran sformed mental health system is highlighted by 
the creation of New Freedom Commission on M ental Health Subcommittee on Evidence-Based 
Practices95.  In Indiana, the following issues must be addressed in order to identify, develop and 
implement effective models of care: 
• Defining effective models of care 
• Assessing readiness for change96  97 
• Applying implementation research98 
• Measuring fidelity 
• Tracking outcomes 
• Using data for quality improvement 
 
FAPE (Free Appropriate Public Education) – Special education and related services that must 
meet state standards provided to stud ent with disabilities without charge.  
 
Population of Concern - The vision articulated above is for young people ages 0 to 22 with 
identified mental health issues and/or substanc e use problems and their families.  The population 
of concern includes individuals at the beginning of their life span; a comprehensive plan that 
includes adults and the elderly, although beyond the scope of this goal statement, would help 
insure social, emotional and behavioral health for all citizens of Indiana. 
 
Quality Improvement  - Given the complexity of issues faced by young people in Indiana and the 
unique socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural char acteristics of the popul ation of concern, the 
fit between available services and individual co nsumers must be continuously monitored.  
Effective innovations that come from clinical expertise and family voice and choice should be 
applied locally, assessed using outcome data,  and disseminated throughout the state.  
 
Real-Time Process and Outcome Data  - Currently, more than 30 community mental health 
centers and other contracted providers, as we ll as a countless number of private providers, 
deliver services to young people in 92 counties th roughout Indiana.  Understanding what services 
are being delivered, to whom, and with what result is critical to transforming the mental health

system and achieving social, emotional and behavio ral health for children and their families.  An 
infrastructure is needed that would allow data on both the services being provided (i.e., process 
data) and the results of those services (i.e., outcome data) for young people to be collected on a 
regular, if not continuous, basis.  With this dat a, effective services cu rrently being provided in 
Indiana could be identified and supported, ineffective services could be improved or stopped, and 
gaps in services could be met by implementing nationally and locally recognized effective models 
of care.   
 
Recovery -  Refers to the process in which people are able to live, work, learn, and participate 
fully in their communities.  For some individuals, recovery is the ability to live a fulfilling and productive life despite a disabilit y.  For others, recovery imp lies the reduction or complete 
remission of symptoms.  Science has shown that having hope plays an integral role in an individual’s recovery. 
 
Resilience - The personal and community qualities that  enable us to rebound from adversity, 
trauma, tragedy, threats, or other stresses—a nd to go on with life with a sense of mastery, 
competence, and hope.  We now understand from research that resilience is fostered by a 
positive childhood and includes positive individual traits, such as optimism, good problem-solving skills, and treatments.  Closely-knit communities  and neighborhoods are also resilient, providing 
support for their members. 
 
Shared Accountability  - Fiscal, workforce and training resources for children’s services are 
limited in Indiana and throughout the country.  As a result, everyone in the system of care must 
provide cost efficient services (i.e., services t hat result in positive outcomes while effectively 
managing costs).  Mechanisms must be in place to insure that service providers are delivering 
services appropriately (including maintaining fidelity to established treatment protocols) and using 
available resources wisely.   
 
Systems of Care  – This comprehensive spectrum of se rvices builds community networks which 
include families, policy makers and workers in child  welfare, juvenile justice, education, mental 
health, primary healthcare and community based organizations who gather around a child and 
provide needed services.  In 2000, Indiana Divisi on of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHA), part 
of the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) initiated implementation of the statewide Systems of Care (SOC) network to better meet the mental health needs of Indiana children.  
About 75% of the state's youth popul ations live in the areas served  by a System of Care.  By 
2006, 51 of Indiana’s 92 counties will have identified SOC programs with new counties being added yearly.   
 
In Indiana and nationally, communities are working to develop and implement a system of care consistent with the following definition: “A co mprehensive spectrum of mental health and other 
necessary services which are organized into a coordinated network to meet the multiple and 
changing needs of children and their families
99.”    To effectively promote children’s social, 
emotional and behavioral health, however, the concept  of a system of care must be viewed more 
broadly to include coordination of services and supports across all of the agencies, organizations 
and individuals that work to improve outcomes fo r children and families at the state, regional, 
county and community levels.  The system of ca re includes the full continuum of services, 
including services delivered in the community, by  child-serving agencies, in residential treatment 
settings and state hospitals.
