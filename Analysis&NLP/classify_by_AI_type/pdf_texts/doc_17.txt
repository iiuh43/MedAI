RESOLVED, That our AMA will revise all relevant and active policies to utilize the term 14 
“documented/undocumented immigrant” in place of the terms "legal/illegal immigrant" 15 
where such text appears; and be it further  16 
 17 
RESOLVED, That our AMA will revise all relevant and active policies to utilize the term 18

reporting in healthcare sectors to ensure that vertical acquisitions in healthcare do not 2 
evade antitrust scrutiny; and be it further  3 
 4 
RESOLVED, That our AMA support healthcare- specific advocacy efforts which will 5 
strengthen antitrust enforcement in the healthcare sector through multiple mechanisms, 6 
which may include but not be limited to a) Simplifying the evidentiary burden on plaintiffs 7 
and shifting the evidentiary burden to defendants and b) Encouraging the FTC to 8 
leverage its authority under Section 7 of the Clayton Act to increase the frequency of 9 
retroactive challenges to healthcare mergers.  10 
 11 
VRC testimony was supportive. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that the 12 
resolution clearly proves that consolidation in healthcare markets has a  negative impact 13 
on patients . The resolution’s goal to increase competition in healthcare markets will help 14 
address high costs for consumers, access to care, and choice of providers. We agree that 15 
a strong stance on this issue will help the MSS monitor upc oming the Council on Medical 16 
Service Report 8. Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 022 be adopted.  17

Our AMA: (1) encourages the use of person -first language (patients with obesity, 28

interventions when discussing health and disease with patients ; and (443) will 34 
educate health care providers on the importance of person- first language for 35 
treating patients with obesity, including the harmful effects of weight bias and 36 
other similar assumptions; equipping their health care facilities with proper sized 37 
furniture, medical equipment and gowns for  patients with obesity; and having 38 
patients weighed respectfully. 39 
 40 
VRC testimony was limited. Your Reference Committee agrees the referred resolution 41 
should not be adopted due to lack of specific evidence for improved clinical outcomes 42 
and novelty concerns. We further find that the AMA has existing policy addressing 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 10 of 142 
 
 
implicit and explicit b ias and former proposed amendments to H -440.821 would not 1

is not enough evidence to support the asks of Resolution 019. We agree with concerns 37 
that the resolution as written opposes the American College of Obstetrics and 38 
Gynecology’s recommendations on midwifery and does not address concerns of scope 39 
creep. Your Reference Committee recommends the Recommendations of MSS WIM 40 
COLA Report A be adopted and the remainder of the report be filed.  41

concerns that the first Resolve is not feasible as the MSS does not have the ability to work 40 
with external partners, only the AMA, and therefore recommends the first resolved clause 41 
to be struck . We further note that the AMA is not a research organization, and AMA support 42 
for a research study is minimally impactful. Additionally, we agree with testimony to amend 43 
the second Resolve to align with the intent of the resolution to support the development of 44

of colorectal cancer screening materials by rural and urban Indian health clinics and the 11 
Indian Health Service in an effective manner via culturally and linguistically competent 12 
resources, patient teaching time and culturally adapted follow -up interventions.  13

VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that the 15 
second and third Resolves are reaffirmation of current policies D -55.998, D -350.990, and 16 
H-55.981. Additionally, we agree with testimony that the first Resolve should be amended 17 
to remove language referring to Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) 18 
benchmarks so we do not refer to other guidelines within AMA policy. Your Reference 19 
Committee also recommends the fourth clause should be removed for longevity of the 20 
policy past the work of the subcommittee. Your Reference Committee recommends 21 
Resolution 052 be adopted as amended.   22 
 23 
Encourage Appropriate Colorectal Cancer Screening D -55.998  24 
Our AMA, in conjunction with interested organizations and 25 
societies, will support educational and public awareness programs 26 
to assure that physicians actively encourage their pat ients to be 27 
screened for colon cancer and precursor lesions, and to improve 28 
patient awareness of appropriate guidelines, particularly within 29 
minority populations and for all high risk groups. Res. 510, A -03; 30

RECOMMENDATION F: 18 
 19 
Resolution 054 be amended by addition of a new Resolve:  20 
 21 
RESOLVED, That our AMA study changing our existing position on medical 22 
aid in dying, including reviewing government data, health services 23 
research, and clinical practices in domestic and international jurisdictions 24

 26 
RECOMMENDATION G:  27 
 28 
The ninth Resolve of Resolution 054 be amended by addition and deletion:  29 
 30 
RESOLVED, That our AMA rescind H -270.965, “Physician -Assisted 31

Resolution 054 be amended by addition of a new Resolve:  38 
 39 
RESOLVED, That our AMA amend H -140.966 “Decisions Near the End of 40 
Life H -140.966” by deletion as follows : 41 
(4) Physicians must not perform euthanasia or participate in 42 
assisted suicide. A more careful examination of the issue is 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 27 of 142 
 
 
necessary. Support, comfort, respect for patient autonomy, good 1 
communication, and adequate pain control may decrease 2 
dramatically the  public demand for euthanasia and assisted suicide. 3 
In certain carefully defined circumstances, it would be humane to 4 
recognize that death is certain and suffering is great. However, the 5 
societal risks of involving physicians in medical interventions to 6 
cause patients' deaths is too great to condone euthanasia or 7 
physician -assisted suicide at this time.  8 
 9 
RECOMMENDATION I:  10 
 11 
Resolution 054 be adopted as amended .  12 
 13 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA -MSS support access to medical aid in dying (MAID) for adults 14

addition and deletion to read as follows; and be it further  27 
 28 
140.034MSS Physician Medical  Aid-In-Dying Protections & Terminology  29 
AMA- MSS (1) supports protections for physicians and other health professionals  30 
who participate in physician medical  aid in dying and (2) encourages u se of the 31 
term “ physician medical  aid in dying” instead of “physician- assisted suicide.”  32 
 33 
RESOLVED, That our AMA- MSS rescind 140.026MSS, “Assisted Suicide,” as it is 34 
superseded by this resolution; and be it further 35

RESOLVED, That our AMA rescind H -270.965, “Physician- Assisted Suicide,” regarding 5 
advocacy opposing legalization of physician- assisted suicide and euthanasia.  6 
 7 
VRC testimony was very supportive with amendments. Your Reference Committee agrees 8 
that this is a well- written resolution with sound evidence, and notes that this is a timely 9 
and important topic with large support from the greater MSS Delegation. We discussed 10 
the history of consideration of Medical Aid in Dying in the AMA House of Delegates, most 11 
recently five years ago, and the potential for individuals and state and specialty 12 
delegations to have moved their position in the interim.   Your Reference Committee 13 
agrees with testimony to combine some resolve clauses and rescind additional policies in 14 
order to make the resolution stronger and more comprehensive. We have identified 15 
additional policies that will need to be rescinded in light  of this resolution. Additionally, we 16 
agree with testimony that “euthanasia” should be removed from all external asks because 17 
it is not the resolution’s intent to conflate euthanasia and medical aid in dying. We agree 18 
that the MSS will need to adopt sufficient internal policy, guided by sound evidence and 19 
testimony, to aid our MSS Delegation in future discussions. Your Reference Committee 20 
agrees with author testimony to add a new ninth Resolve to address the AMA’s position 21 
on medical aid in dying. Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 054 be 22 
adopted as amended.   23

to preserve patients' rights to privacy regarding medical care while 7 
incarcerated while ensuring appropriate use of medical records in parole 8 
and other legal proceedings to protect incarcerated individuals from 9 
punitive actions related to their medical care.  improve adequate review of 10 
health history to determine relevance of inclusion in parole portfolio 11

adequate review of health history to determine relevance of inclusion in parole portfolio 28 
application packets, preventing unforeseen consequences arising from unnecessary 29 
health record inclusion.   30 
 31 
VRC testimony was  supportive with amendments. Your Reference Committee agrees with 32 
testimony  that the first and second Resolves are not sufficiently supported by the whereas 33 
clauses. We agree with amendments from the American College of Correctional 34 
Physicians to collaborate with relevant stakeholders to determine if inclusion of medical 35 
records is appropriate in parole and other legal proceedings. The House Coordination 36 
Committee slated the first and third Resolves as reaffirmation of H -315.983. The 37 
Reference Committee believes that the third Resolve as amended is novel and will 38 
promote collaborative efforts. Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 057 be 39 
adopted as amended.  40

VRC testimony was supportive. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that 8 
this resolution is well- written , well-researched , and will ha ve strong impact on a topic which 9 
is of high priority to our Medical Student Section . We agree with amendments to clarify 10 
and bolster the impact of this resolution.  We appreciate the clear, evidence- based 11 
argument made between healthcare and criminal just ice. We discussed use of “legislation” 12 
specifically versus “efforts” and favored “legislation” for more tangible outcomes in support 13 
of incarcerated individuals. Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 058 be 14

amended the first resolve clause to target patients and physicians in avoiding and 15 
reporting fraud , with  “relevant stakeholders” encompassing hospital systems,  and 16 
expanded the scope from health insurance scams to healthcare- related scams. The 17

in Science”, to read as follows:  32 
 33 
Fraud and Misrepresentation in Science H -460.972  34 
The AMA: (1) supports the promotion of structured discussions of 35 
ethics that include research, clinical practice, and basic human 36 
values within all medical school curricula and fellowship training 37 
programs; (2) supports the promotion, through AMA publicati ons 38 
and other vehicles, of (a) a clear understanding of the scientific 39 
process, possible sources of error, and the difference between 40 
intentional and unintentional scientific misrepresentation, and (b) 41 
multidisciplinary discussions to formulate a standardized definition 42 
of scientific fraud and misrepresentation that elaborates on 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 34 of 142 
 
 
unacceptable behavior; (3) supports the promotion of discussions 1 
on the peer review process and the role of the physician 2 
investigator; (4) supports the development of specific standardized 3 
guidelines dealing with the disposition of primary research data, 4 
generative augmented intelligence in research and scientific 5 
publications,  authorship responsibilities, supervision of research 6 
trainees, role of institutional standards, and potential sanctions for 7 
individuals proved guilty of scientific misconduct; (5) supports the 8 
sharing of information about scientific misconduct among 9 
institutions, funding agencies, professional societies, and 10 
biomedical research journals; and (6) will educate,  at appropriate 11 
intervals, physicians and physicians -in-training about the currently 12 
defined difference between being an "author" and being a 13 
"contributor" as defined by the Uniform Requirements for 14 
Manuscripts of the International Committee of Medical Jou rnal 15 
Editors, as well as the varied potential for industry bias between 16 
these terms.  17 
 18 
VRC testimony was supportive with amendments. Your Reference Committee agrees with 19 
testimony that the first Resolve was too vague to be impactful as originally written and 20 
have added amendments to address what will be regulated by journals based on the 21 
whereas clauses and VRC testimony. We further agree with the amendment to not only 22 
address the impacts of augmented intelligence on research with journal guidelines but 23 
also by encouraging augmented intelligence developers to prioritize factuality in the 24 
creation of these systems. While we agree that augmented intelligence in scientific writing 25 
and publication is a relatively new field, we believe it is critical to act quickl y while the field 26 
is in its nascency and policy can help direct its future direction. We therefore recommend 27 
adding an immediate forwarding clause so our AMA can act now rather than wait until the 28 
next AMA Meeting of the House of Delegates. Your Reference Committee recommends 29 
Resolution 067 be adopted as amended.  30

VRC testimony was supportive with amendments. Your Reference Committee agrees with 9 
testimony that amendments to the second Resolve would ensure that the quality of 10 
healthcare provided by for -profit prisons is the same quality as the care provided by their 11 
public counterparts . Additionally, the amendments would clarify the R esolve clause’s 12 
intent as many public prisons engage in contracts with private, for -profit entities to provide 13 
medical services within public prisons. Your Reference Committee recommends 14 
Resolution 070 be adopted as amended.  15

 23 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA work with relevant stakeholders to urge medical 24 
schools to allow students and their families who qualify for and enroll in 25 
other health insurance with equal or greater coverage, including Medicaid, 26

 40 
VRC testimony was mainly supportive. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony 41 
to clarify the policy by addition of a three- word amendment. We agree that the amendment 42 
clarifies that students must be eligible and enroll in other insurance plans to be exempt 43

The first Resolve of Resolution 075  be amended by deletion:  9 
 10 
RESOLVED, That our AMA supports the establishment of comprehensive 11 
sickle cell treatment care centers to address critical care gaps that patients 12 
with sickle cell disease (SCD) face and improve both the quality of care and 13 
life for patients affected by SCD.  14

RECOMMENDATION B: 16 
 17 
Resolution 075 be amended by addition of a new Resolve:  18 
 19 
RESOLVED, That our AMA amend H -350.973 “Sickle Cell Center”  by 20 
addition to read as follows: 21

treatment care centers to address critical care gaps that  patients with sickle cell disease 38 
(SCD) face and improve both the quality of care and life for patients affected by SCD. 39 
 40 
VRC testimony supports the spirit of the resolution. The Reference Committee agrees with 41 
testimony  from the American Society of Hematology  (ASH)  that the resolution as written 42 
is too narrow in scope. There are multiple bills coming through Congress focused on 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 39 of 142 
 
 
various aspects of sickle cell disease treatment. Amendments were proffered to broaden 1 
the language and expand future access to the treatment of sickle cell disease. We 2 
discussed incorporation of the ASH’s amendment into existing AMA policy H -350.973. The 3 
proposed amendment will lead to a more comprehensive and impactful ask. Your 4 
Reference Committee recommends Resolution 075 be adopted as amended.  5

VRC testimony was supportive with amendments. Your Reference Committee agrees with 5 
testimony to amend both resolve clauses to improve the specificity and clarity. We agree 6 
with amendments to the first Resolve to eliminate the confusing distinction between 7 
prescription drug and medical benefits  and expand on the list of insurance sources. We 8 
also agree with the amendment to clarify the second Resolve and directly oppose Direct 9 
Member Reimbursement. Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 084 be 10

 13 
VRC testimony was supportive with amendments. Your Reference Committee agrees with 14 
testimony to amend the second Resolve by clarifying the action requested. Your 15 
Reference Committee agrees with testimony to strike the third Resolve as there is already 16 
evidence that being granted asylum can have a positive impact on medical and mental 17 
health of asylees as outlined by authors in the resolution and thus further study would not 18 
significantly change the AMA’s advocacy on this topic.   Removing the ask for research 19 
strengthens the resolution and focuses the action. Your Reference Committee 20 
recommends Resolution 090 be adopted as amended.  21

1. That the policies specified for retention in Appendix 1 of this report be retained as 11 
official, active policies of the AMA -MSS.  12

4. That the AMA MSS policy 630.044MSS be amended by addition and deletion as 19 
follows:  20 
 21 
630.044MSS Sunset Mechanism for AMA -MSS Policy  22 
AMA- MSS will establish and use a sunset mechanism for 23 
AMA- MSS policy with a five year time horizon whereby a 24 
policy will remain viable for five years unless action is taken 25 
by the Assembly to reestablish or refer it. The 26 
implementation of a sunset mechanism for AMA -MSS policy 27 
shall follow the following procedures: (1) review of policies 28 
will be the ultimate responsibility of the Governing Council, 29 
whereby the report is authored by the Chair of the 30 
Governing Council with initial policy recommendations 31 
being solicited from relevant Standing Committees as 32 
appropriate; (2) The Governing Council will provide 33 
Standing Committees clear guidance regarding criteria for 34 
recommendations of retention, retention with amendments, 35 
or sunset; (3) policy recommendations will be reported to 36 
the AMA -MSS Assembly at each Interim  Annual  Meeting on 37 
the five or five and one- half year anniversary of a policy's 38 
adoption, with a brief rationale accompanying each 39 
recommendation; (4) a consent calendar format will be used 40 
by the Assembly in considering the policies encompassed 41 
within the report;  and (5) a vote will not be necessary on 42 
policies recommended for rescission as they will 43 
automatically expire under the auspices of the sunset 44

mechanism unless referred back to the Governing Council. ; 1 
and (6)  the MSS Governing Council may recommend 2 
policies for consolidation as part of the sunset review 3 
process.  4 
 5 
VRC testimony was in support of changing language of Appendix A, Item 95 to reflect 6 
recent transmittal language related to the same policy. Your Reference Committee 7 
appreciates this thorough report and broadly agrees with proposals to update the 8 
language of the Sunset policy to reflect changes in timing of the report to be submitted 9 
and changes to the policy compendium put forward. We discussed revision of several 10 
policies for retention with amendment to the original language, as it was more expansive 11 
and would better support future resolutions put forward by the AMA -MSS, updating titles 12 
of policies that were changed, and incorporating suggested amendments noted in VRC 13 
testimony. We propose changing language of Appendix A, Item 95 to reflect recent 14 
transmittal language related to the same policy given that this new language encompasses 15 
the most recent goals of AMA -MSS members; amend the titles of Appendix A, Items 15 16 
and 28 to reflect changes initially missed; and retain the original language of   Appendix A, 17 
Items 7 and 13 to better reflect the tenets  of the asks from the AMA -MSS of the AMA to 18 
act on as they are more expansive and better reflect the intent/ tenets  proposed in those 19 
policies. Your Ref erence Committee recommends the Recommendations of GC Report A 20 
be adopted as amended and the remainder of the report be filed.  21

Procedures  31 
1. A minimum of 90 days before the start of a national MSS 32 
meeting, the MSS Delegate and Alternate Delegate, with 33 
input from other members of the MSS caucus to the AMA 34 
House of Delegates, release a list of several suggested 35 
resolution topics based on perceived gaps in the MSS 36 
Digest of Actions.  37 
2. A list of all GCMSS Action Items received during the period 38 
between M SS national meetings will be included in the 39 
Meeting Handbook as official MSS Actions, along with their 40 
implementation status. Additionally, the MSS should create 41 
an opportunity for the Governing Council to discuss GC MSS  42 
Action Item implementation status with interested students. 43 
Additionally, the MSS should create an opportunity for the 44 
Governing Council to discuss GC Action Item 45 
implementation status with interested students.  46 
3. That Reference Committees be encouraged to r ecommend 47 
GC Action Items in future report reasoning.  48 
4. All authored resolutions are submitted to the region of the 49 
resolution’s primary author for rough draft scoring using the 50 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 48 of 142 
 
 
MSS Scoring Rubric. Following the draft submission 1 
deadline, regional delegates and alternate delegates will be 2 
assigned specific resolutions, for which they score and 3 
subsequently contact the particular resolution’s author to 4 
offer feedback and suggestions prior to the MSS final 5 
resolution deadline.  6 
5. All resolutions submitted for MSS consideration by the 7 
resolution deadline will be scored blindly by the MSS House 8 
Coordinating Committee and the Regional and Alternate 9 
Delegates from the 6 regions where the primary author’s 10 
school is not located, with each resolution’s average ranking 11 
subs equently being released to the author.  12 
6. Our MSS will release detailed resolution formatting rules 13 
and an easy to use template for resolution drafting, available 14 
on the MSS Resolution Resources page. Resolutions not 15 
meeting the formatting guidelines will be returned to the 16 
submitting author and not be accepted until properly 17 
formatted within the established deadlines.  18

RESOLVED, That our AMA -MSS reaffirm 630.007MSS and 630.025MSS; and be it further  21 
 22 
RESOLVED, That our AMA- MSS rescind 630.008MSS, 630.016MSS, 630.037MSS, 23 
630.051MSS, 630.055MSS, 630.074MSS, 630.075MSS, 645.023MSS, 645.032MSS, 24 
and 645.034MSS; and be it further  25 
 26 
RESOLVED, That our AMA- MSS rescind all statements of formal support for AMA policies 27 
listed in the section “AMA- MSS St atements of Support for HOD Policies” of the MSS 28 
Digest of Policy Actions; and be it further  29 
 30 
RESOLVED, That our AMA- MSS will investigate strategies for (a) preserving institutional 31 
memory, which would document the results of MSS resolutions and actions taken by the 32 
AMA in response to policies passed by the AMA HOD and (b) reporting this information to 33 
the MSS.  34 
 35 
VRC testimony was absent. Your Reference Committee appreciates this thorough report 36 
and broadly agrees with proposals by the Task Force which serve, in part, to reduce 37 
redundant internal operating policy and remove policy which is no longer relevant for the 38 
functioning of our section. We propose clarifying amendments, grammatical amendments, 39 
and amendments which better outline functions of certain MSS roles. We discussed 40 
resolved clause one point 2 and preferred to clarify that feedback from the aforementioned 41 
members is particularly sought during the draft review phase while general MSS members 42 
still have opportunities for participation at other times. We discussed use and highlighting 43 
of MSS Action Items as a recommendation by the Reference Committee.   Location of 44 
“MSS action item” was determined by discussion aligning MSS AI with actions we can 45 
take to promote MSS member ideas, much like our “adoption,” “adoption as amended,” 46 
“adoption in lieu of,” and “referral.”   We discussed several possible mechanisms for 47 
determining the order of MSS Assembly business, considering how to prioritize items 48 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 49 of 142 
 
 
important to our section, reasonably add  work to existing roles, utilize the wisdom of 1 
members with House of Delegates experience, and promote collaborative discussion in 2 
this process.   We discussed the possibility of continuing MSS Caucus member review, 3 
having our seven Region Delegation Chairs  determine order, having our Section Delegate 4 
and Alternate Delegate decide order, having a random order, and having your Reference 5 
Committee determine the order of items in each category. Understanding that items 6 
extracted from the Reference Committee Report but not discussed revert to a position or 7 
not adopt, we thoroughly considered each possibility.   Ultimately, we determined that 8 
randomization of item order would not allow prioritization of key items for our section. Due 9 
to extensive review of each resolution and its corresponding testimony, we decided that 10 
the Reference Committee taking on the responsibility of determining order of items in each 11 
category does not overburden any MSS individual or committee while retaining multiple 12 
voices and opinions in discussion. We further note that any member still retains the ability 13 
to motion on MSS Assembly floor to extract an item to move it forward or backward in 14 
discussion, retaining broad representation of our MSS members voices and priorities each 15 
Meeting. On resolved clause one point six, we determined that two months was too 16 
prescriptive, noting the difference in policy cycle lengths between the Annual and Interim 17 
MSS Assembly meetings and preferred a broader timeline for updates, still to occur before 18 
our M SS Policy Cycles originates. We also discussed resolved clause three, amending 19 
645.031MSS “MSS Action Items,” and look forward to the role of the proposed MSS Task 20 
Force on MSS Standing Committees may or may not seek to implement MSS Action Items 21 
in the purview of Standing Committees where it may be indicated. Your Reference 22 
Committee agrees with reaffirmation and rescission of the mentioned policies and their 23 
justifications, noting that relevant portions were added to new resolved clauses of this 24 
report where appropriate. On resolved clause seven, we discussed that AMA members 25 
may have graduated out of the MSS by the time their original resolutions are heard by the 26 
AMA House of Delegates. We hope adding “original resolution authors” may encourage 27 
closed loop communication that allows authors to know the results of their work and be 28 
proud of the results. Finally, with the magnitude of these changes, we would like the 29 
Governing Council to re- evaluate the status of these recommendations in three years, a 30 
time t hat standard four -year medical students will be able to see the results of. Your 31 
Reference Committee recommends the Recommendations of GC Report B: Resolution 32 
Task Force be adopted as amended and the remainder of the report be filed. 33

Your Section Delegates further recommend the following resolutions be amended as 1 
indicated:  2 
1. 73 Mitigating Environmental Contributors to Disease and Sustainability of AMA 3

Your Section Delegates further recommend that the following resolutions be held in the 9 
queue 10 
for the duration of the current meeting due to other ongoing movement on related items:  11 
1. 160 Support of Research on Vision Screenings and Visual Aids for Adults Covered 12 
by Medicaid; 130 Establishing Comprehensive Dental Benefits Under State 13 
Medicaid Programs; 223 Medicaid Hearing Coverage 14 
2. 107 Abolishment of the Resolution Committee  15 
 16 
VRC testimony is absent.   Your Reference Committee applauds our Section Delegates 17 
for their work condensing resolutions and discharging items based on actions taken by the 18 
MSS at the AMA House of Delegates. While we agree with discharging MSS Transmittals 19 
132, 127, and 143 based on recent actions of the House of Delegates, we think it is 20 
prudent to maintain MSS Transmittal 37 in the queue at this time. The scope of the 21 
upcoming report on national meeting locations is much broader and not necessarily 22 
inclusive of MSS Transmittal 37. It will likely be necessary for the MSS to take specific 23 
actions on the resulting report to include MSS Transmittal 37 in the recommendations. 24 
Further, depending on the report recommendations it may be more prudent to send MSS 25 
Transmittal 37 as an independent resolution at a meeting after the recommendations of 26 
the pending report are decided. Therefore, to stay in concordance with past transmittal 27 
discharge procedures, your Reference Committee believes MSS Transmittal 37 should 28 
not be discharged until the proposal it proffers  is enacted or substantially debated by the 29 
House of Delegates. Your Reference Committee recommends the Recommendations of 30 
MSS Delegate Report A: Status of Pending MSS -Authored Resolutions to the HOD be 31 
adopted as amended and the remainder of the report be filed.  32

part of the investigation of those alleged infractions. The 19 
candidate is required to participate in the investigation. The 20 
Speaker and the Vice Speaker shall have the discretion to 21 
delegate any portion of the investigation to the Rules 22 
Committee. The extent of delegation can vary depending on 23 
the circumstances and the Speakers’ judgment. The final 24 
authority in making a decision regarding the matter shall rest 25 
in with the Speaker and Vice Speaker. For a reported 26 
infraction to be substantiated, both the Speaker and Vice 27 
Speaker must be in agreement. To arrive at a decision, the 28 
Speaker and Vice Speaker may involve the Rules Commi ttee 29 
as they see fit. No individual who is a candidate for the same 30

recommendation to the Assembly.  15 
 16 
RECOMMENDATION D: 17 
 18 
IOPETF Report A Section 6.5.12.5 be amended by addition and deletion to 19 
read as follows:  20 
 21 
6.5.12.5.  Appeals  Process.  Appeals occur after a determination of whether 22 
an infraction is substantiated or after a determination of whether a 23 
candidate should be disqualified . Appeals focus on the process of the 24 
investigation or determination. Should a candidate feel that due process 25 
was not followed in either of these cases and that an appeal is warranted, 26 
they must submit this in writing to the Chair of the MSS GC within twenty- 27 
four (24) hours of being notified of the result  and before the start of 28 
balloting . The GC, excluding investigator sing members  (Section 6.5.12.2) 29 
and candidates for the election being investigated, shall  promptly  convene 30 
to review the appeal and determine whether the previous decision should 31 
be reversed  prior to the start of balloting  to the close of the House of 32 
Delegates. Region Chairs and Acting Chairs shall be offered the 33 
opportunity to provide comments on whether the appeal is justified.  34 
Whenever possible, an appeal should be  completed  reviewed prior to the 35 
results of the investigation being released to the Assembly.  36 
 37 
RECOMMENDATION E: 38 
 39 
IOPETF Report be adopted as amended .  40 
 41

report recommendations.  43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023)

 1 
VRC testimony was limited. Your Reference Committee agreed with testimony offering 2 
amendments to the appeals process to create an environment whic h is fair to all 3 
candidates, for clarification of timing of appeals before balloting is to occur and allowing 4 
Regional Chairs to be included in the appeals process. Your Reference Committee was 5 
concerned about concentration of infraction decision making authority in a single individual 6 
and therefore recommends amendments making it necessary for both the Speaker and 7 
Vice Speaker to decide an infraction has occurred in order for it to be substantiated. We 8 
believe this diffusion of power adds a critical check on the infraction determination 9 
process, will improve fair consideration,  and is in line with the spirit of the VRC 10 
amendments that were reviewed by AMA Council members. Your Reference Committee 11 
acknowledges the  significant time and months spent by the Task Force, MSS Speakers, 12 
and members of the AMA Council on Constitution and Bylaws in order to refine these 13 
changes and improve our Section’s elections. Your Reference Committee recommends 14 
the Internal Operating Procedures & Election Task Force Report to be adopted as 15 
amended, and for the remainder of the report to be filed.   16

pregnancy prevention)  for their disabled patient patients with 1 
disabilities or vulnerable circumstances  in their care.  2 
 3 
VRC testimony was  limited. Your Reference Committee recommends amending the 4 
recommendation to internal policy. The internal amendment will allow the MSS to support 5 
broadening of language to oppose any forced sterilization and recognize the unique need 6 
of people with disabi lities concerning sterilization. Your Reference Committee 7 
recommends the Recommendations of MSS CDA WIM CBH be adopted as amended and 8

advanced technologies to improve the efficiency of 1 
care;  2 
(2) with the advice of specific specialty societies, 3 
advocate for the creation and funding of additional 4 
residency training positions in specialties that provide 5 
emergency and trauma care and for financial incentive 6 
programs, such as loan repayment program s, to 7 
attract physicians to these specialties;  8 
(3) continue to advocate for the following: a. Insurer 9 
payment to physicians who have delivered EMTALA - 10 
mandated, emergency care, regardless of in- network 11

for providing EMTALA -mandated care to uninsured 13 
patients, c. Bonus payments to physicians who 14 
provide emergency/trauma services to patients from 15 
physician shortage areas, regardless of the site of 16 
service, d. Federal and state liability protections for 17 
physicians providing EMTALA -mandated care;  18 
(4) disseminate these recommendations immediately 19

Labor Act (EMTALA) mandated care if an evaluation of 28 
a demonstration program, as called for in AMA Policy 29 
D-130.971(5), shows evidence that physicians would 30 
benefit by such extension; and  31 
(7) if an evaluation of a demonstration program, as 32 
called for in AMA Policy D -130.971(5), shows evidence 33 
that physicians would benefit by extension of the 34 
FTCA, our AMA will conduct a legislative campaign, 35 
coordinated with national specialty societies, targeted 36 
toward extending FTCA protections to all EMTALA - 37 
mandated care, and the AMA will assign high priority 38 
to this effort.  39

VRC testimony was supportive with amendments. Your Reference Committee agrees with 1 
testimony that labeling foods is quite difficult, expresses concerns about feasibility of 2 
implement ation, and is within the FDA’s purview. We agree that the asks of this resolution 3 
will not meaningfully change AMA advocacy efforts, and we recommend amendments to 4 
make this resolution internal. We agree that clause 4(b) of D -150.974 was struck without 5 
sufficient evidence from the whereas clauses and further clarified the resolution by 6 
amending to internal support. Your Reference Committee recommends Alternate 7 
Resolution 010 be adopted in lieu of Resolution 010.  8

VRC testimony was supportive with amendments. Your Reference Committee agrees with 18 
testimony that this resolution is very timely and should be amended to consolidate the ask. 19 
We agree with amendments to amend current MSS Transmittal 192 and clarify the ask s 20 
of the resolution while preserving original language. Amending the MSS transmittal will 21 
allow for the MSS to address the reduction of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 22 
(SNAP) in the wake of the “ending” of the COVID benefit expansion. Your Reference 23 
Committee recommends Alternate Resolution 017 be adopted in lieu of Resolution 017.  24

 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 64 of 142 
 
 
RESOLVED, That our AMA recognizes that there is a high- quality evidence gap for the 1 
screening, management, prevention, and treatment of American Indian and Alaska Native 2 
women with high- risk HPV infections; and be it further  3 
 4 
RESOLVED, That our AMA  will advocate to federal agencies to conduct epidemiological 5 
surveys of high- risk HPV subtypes most prevalent among American Indian and Alaska 6 
Native women.  7 
 8 
VRC testimony was supportive with amendments. Your Reference Committee agrees with 9 
testimony that reformulating the HPV vaccine to achieve broader coverage of high- risk 10 
strains in the AI/AN population would improve health outcomes. We have broadened the 11 
language to focus on many types of vulnerable populations including “racial, ethnic, 12 
socioeconomic, and geographic differences in high- risk HPV” and formatted the new 13 
Resolve as an amendment to current AMA policy “HPV Vaccine and Cervical Cancer 14 
Prevention Worldwide” (H -440.872). Your Reference Committee recommends Alternate 15 
Resolution 038 be adopted in lieu of Resolution 038.  16

of healthcare insurance scams and how to avoid them, and encourage them to distribute 32 
these resources to their patients; and be it further  33 
 34 
RESOLVED, That our AMA encourage hospitals to provide information or resources to 35 
patients about healthcare insurance scams. 36 
 37 
VRC testimony was supportive of the spirit of the resolution. Your Reference Comm ittee 38 
agrees with concerns that the resolution would not significantly impact AMA’s advocacy 39 
efforts. We agree that amendments to consolidate and redirect the ask within the AMA’s 40 
scope will improve the resolution’s feasibility. Amending the policy to an internal resolve 41 
clause allows the MSS to support the spirit of the resolution. Your Reference Committee 42 
recommends Alternate Resolution 061 be adopted in lieu of Resolution 061.  43

b) Demonstrated improved therapeutic benefit to patients over the predicate devices 20 
on which the exemption is based  21 
c) Extension of the requirement that an exemption may not be predicated on a device 22 
that has been recalled to include voluntary recalls  23 
 24 
VRC testimony was supportive of the spirit. Your Reference Committee agrees with 25 
testimony that the resolution should be amended as new internal policy. The asks of the 26 
resolution will be addressed in a Council on Science and Public Health report at the Annual 27 
2023 Meeting of the AMA House of Delegates that outlines the study of MSS transmittal 28 
270.040MSS. By amending the resolution to an internal ask, the MSS can take a stance 29 
on the upcoming CSAPH report. Your Reference Committee recommends Alternate 30

deletion to read as follows:  3 
 4 
Use of Language Interpreters in the Context of the Patient -Physician 5 
Relationship H -160.924  6 
1. AMA policy is that: (1) further research is necessary 7 
on how the use of interpreters-- both those who are 8 
trained and those who are not --impacts patient care; (b) 9 
treating physicians shall respect and assist the 10 
patients' choices whether to involve capable family 11 
members or friends to provide language assistance that 12 
is culturally sensitive and competent, with or without an 13 
interpreter who is competent and culturally sensitive; 14 
(c) physicians continue to be resourceful in their use of 15 
other appropriate means that can help facilitate 16 
communication-- including print materials, digital and 17 
other electronic or telecommunication services with the 18 
understanding, however, of these tools' limitations --to 19 
aid Limited English Proficiency (LEP) patients' 20 
involvement in meaningful decisions about their care; 21 
d) patients have expanded access to documentation 22 
and communications available in their preferred 23 
language, including appointment reminder 24 
calls/messages, post -appointment summaries, and 25 
electronic medical records, through access to trained 26 
interpreter and translator services; (d e) physicians 27 
cannot be expected to provide and fund these 28 
translation services for their patients, as the 29 
Department of Health and Human Services' policy 30 
guidance currently requires; when trained medical 31 
interpreters are needed, the costs of their services shall 32 
be paid directly to the interpreters by patients and/or 33 
third party payers and physicians shall not be required 34 
to participate in payment arrangements.  35 
2. Our AMA recognizes the importance of using medical 36 
interpreters as a means of improving quality of care 37 
provided to patients with LEP including patients with 38 
sensory impairments.  39 
3. Our AMA promote opportunities for physicians, 40 
trainees, and medical staff to receive medical 41 
interpreter training.  42

providing appointment reminder calls/messages, post -appointment summaries, electronic 4 
medical records, and any other documentation or communication in the patient’s preferred 5 
language by professional medical translators; and be it further 6 
 7 
RESOLVED, That our AMA advocates on a national level for the incorporation of these 8 
expanded interpreter services and supports an increase in hospital reimbursement of 9 
interpret ation costs by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to ensure access 10 
to quality interpretation services for all patients. 11

 19 
 20 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committees agrees with testimony to improve 21 
patient access to trained interpreters and promote opportunities for physicians, trainees, 22 
and medical staff to receive interpreter training. We agree with consolidation of related 23 
asks to decrease the number of items transmitted to the House of Delegates by our 24 
section. We agree that amendments to current policy H- 160.924 cover the asks of 25 
Resolution 056 and 080. Your Reference Committee recommends Alternate  Resolution 26

PE firms often has detrimental consequences for patients and providers; and be it further  11 
 12 
RESOLVED, That our AMA -MSS opposes the acquisition of healthcare practices by PE 13 
firms due to their detrimental effects on healthcare access, patient outcomes, and 14 
increased financial burden on the health care system.  15 
 16 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that there 17 
is not enough evidence outrightly oppose private equity acquisition of healthcare practices. 18 
The Council on Medical Service is doing a series of reports related to health care 19 
consolidation and a study will enable the MSS to establish a position on this specific 20 
component of that topic that will be useful going forward. We recommend that these HOD 21 
reports be considered along with further study from the MSS. Your Reference Committee 22 
recommends Resolution 015 be referred.  23

Medical -Legal Partnerships and greater incorporation of civil legal needs as Social 2 
Determinants of Health into medical school curricula, similar to the Health Justice 3 
Alliance at Georgetown University.  4 
 5 
VRC testimony was mixed. Resolution 024 and 063 address very similar topics. We agree 6 
that these two resolutions would be best combined and referred to study to 1.) address 7 
evaluating the impact of recognizing civil legal aid services as a social determinant of 8 
health, 2.) determine the work that other medical education stakeholders, such as The 9 
American Association of Medical Colleges, have done on medical -legal education and 10 
related topics, and 3.)  clarify the AMA's role in addressing this issue. We agree that referral 11 
will provide improved language and a clear path forward for AMA advocacy. Your 12

Page 70 of 142 
 
 
RESOLVED, Our AMA supports the use of language interpreters and translators 1 
in clinical and medical research participation to promote equitable data collection 2 
and outcomes; and be it further.  3 
The Reference Committee recommends the following questions for study: 1.) What 4 
potential training is required to provide specific research study interpretation and 5 
translation services? 2.) Do programs need to invest not just in the cost of medical 6 
interpreter services, but in training to meaningfully communicate information from clinical 7 
studies? 3.) What is the role of IRB and institutional guidelines in accomplishing the asks 8 
of this resolution? 4.) How can this item be strengthened with other possible mechanisms 9 
to inc rease equity in medical studies with greater inclusion of Limited English Proficiency 10 
individuals? Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 028 be referred.  11

(47) RESOLUTION 030 - ADVOCATING FOR METHADONE MAINTENANCE 13 
THERAPY DISPENSATION IN COMMUNITY PHARMACY SETTINGS  14 
 15 
RECOMMENDATION: 16 
 17 
Resolution 030 be referred.  18 
 19 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA support the ability of OTP clinicians, physicians holding 20 
board certification in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry, and other appropriately 21 
trained physicians such as primary care physicians to prescribe methadone for opioid 22 
use disorder that can be dispensed through a pharmacy for individuals for unsupervised 23 
use; and be it further  24 
  25 
RESOLVED, That our AMA amend Policy D -95.961 by addition and deletion to read as 26 
follows:  27 
 28 
Enabling Methadone Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder in Primary Care 29 
Settings D -95.961  30 
Our AMA: (1) will research current best practices and support pilot programs and 31 
other evidence- based efforts to expand and integrate primary care services for 32 
patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment; (2) supports further 33 
research to help define the population of patients who may be safely treated with 34 
advocate for the provision of methadone maintenance treatment via office -based 35 
treatment, including primary care; and (3) urges all payers, including health 36 
insurance companies, pharmacy benefit management companies, and state and 37 
federal agencies, to reduce prior authorization and other administrative burdens 38 
and to enhance the provision of primary care, counseling, and other medically 39 
necessary services for patients being treated with methadone maintenance 40 
treatment ; and (4) will advocate for methadone maintenance therapy doses to be 41 
dispensed in a community pharmacy setting for patients who are receiving 42

VRC testimony was mainly in opposition to the resolution as written. Your Reference 4 
Committee agrees with testimony that study would help refine language and bolster the 5 
asks with evidence before bringing this resolution forward to the House of Delegates. We 6 
agree with testimony to strike the first Resolve and recommend referring the second 7 
resolve clause to study. Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 030 be 8 
referred.   9 
 10 
(48) RESOLUTION 033 - RACIAL MISCLASSIFICATION  11 
 12 
RECOMMENDATION: 13 
 14 
Resolution 033 be referred.  15 
 16 
RESOLVED, Our AMA amend Improving Death Certification Accuracy and Completion 17 
H-85.953 by addition as follows:  18 
 19 
Improving Death Certification Accuracy and Completion H - 20 
85.953  21 
1. Our AMA: (a) acknowledges that the reporting of vital events is 22 
an integral part of patient care; (b) urges physicians to ensure 23 
completion of all state vital records carefully and thoroughly with 24 
special attention to the use of standard nomenclature, using 25 
legible writing and accurate diagnoses; and (c) supports notifying 26 
state medical societies and state departments of vital statistics of 27 
this policy and encouraging their assistance and cooperation in 28 
implementing it.  29 
2. Our AMA also: (a) supports the position that efforts to improve 30 
cause of death statistics are indicated and necessary; (b) 31 
endorses the concept that educational efforts to improve death 32 
certificates should be focused on physicians, particularly those 33 
who take care of patients in facilities where patients are likely to 34 
die, namely in acute hospitals, nursing homes and hospices; and 35 
(c) supports the concept that training sessions in completion of 36 
death certificates should be (i) included in hospital house staff 37 
orientation sessions and clinical pathologic conferences; (ii) 38 
integrated into continuing medical education presentations; (iii) 39 
mandatory in mortality conferences; and (iv) included as part of in- 40 
service training programs for nursing homes, hospices and 41 
geriatric physicians.  42 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 72 of 142 
 
 
3. Our AMA further: (a) promotes and encourages the use of ICD 1 
codes among physicians as they complete medical claims, 2 
hospital discharge summaries, death certificates, and other 3 
documents; (b) supports cooperating with the National Center for 4 
Health Statistics (NCHS) in monitoring the four existing models for 5 
collecting tobacco -use data; (c) urges the NCHS to identify 6 
appropriate definitions, categories, and methods of collecting risk - 7 
factor data, including quantification of exposure, for inclusion on 8 
the U.S. Standard Certificates, and that subsequent data be 9 
appropriately disseminated; and (d) continues to encourage all 10 
physicians to report tobacco use, exposure to environmental 11 
tobacco smoke, and other risk factors using the current standard 12 
death certificate format.  13 
4. Our AMA further: (a) support s HIPAA- compliant data linkages 14 
between Native Hawaiian and Tribal Registries, population- based 15 
and hospital -based clinical trial and disease registries, and local, 16 
state, tribal, and federal vital statistics databases aimed at 17 
minimizing racial misclassif ication.  18 
 19 
VRC testimony was mixed between support and referral. Your Reference Committee 20 
agrees with testimony that insufficient evidence was provided in the resolution to support 21 
data linkages between vital statistics databases and tribal registries/hospi tal-based 22 
databases. Your Reference Committee agrees that this resolution covers an important 23 
topic and recommends referral to ensure the ask is comprehensive. Your Reference 24 
Committee recommends the following questions be addressed by the MSS committees: 25 
1.) How would the AMA support creating a HIPAA -compliant data linkage system with 26 
reservations that do not have HIPAA laws? 2.) What are the effects of creating a data 27 
linkage system? 3.) Are there any unintended consequences? Your Reference Committee 28 
recommends Resolution 033 be referred.  29 
 30 
(49) RESOLUTION 035 - INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE PHARMACEUTICAL 31 
COVERAGE 32 
 33 
RECOMMENDATION: 34 
 35 
Resolution 035 be referred.  36 
 37 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA will advocate to the U.S. Department of Health and Human 38 
Services that essential FDA -approved pharmaceuticals mandated for coverage by 39 
Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program programs 40 
should also be covered by the Indian Health Service.  41 
 42 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 73 of 142 
 
 
RESOLVED, That our AMA will work with the Indian Health Service and appropriate 1 
agencies and organizations to ensure that their National Core Formulary includes at 2 
least two standard- of-care drugs proven to be equally effective in each therapeutic 3 
category or pharmacologic class, if available, to be used by the physician in deciding the 4 
best treatment options for their patients, including:  5 
i. antidepressants;  6 
ii. antipsychotics;  7 
iii. anticonvulsants;  8 
iv. immunosuppressants for treatment of transplant rejection;  9 
v. antiretrovirals;   10 
vi. antineoplastics;  11 
 12 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony in support 13 
of the resolution’s spirit yet shares concerns about feasibility and specific language 14 
proposed. We recommend that the  committees studying this resolution address the 15 
following questions: 1.) Does medication covered by all three insurance programs need to 16 
be covered by IHS or all medications covered by any of those programs? 2.) Is it necessary 17 
and feasible to include both Resolve 1 and 2 or would Resolve 2 be sufficient, as Resolve 18 
2 mirrors AMA policy for Medicare Part D? 3.) Does this introduce an added financial 19 
burden to AI/AN communities? Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 035 20 
be referred.   21

(50) RESOLUTION 043 - SUPPORT FOR INCREASED DIVERSITY IN GENETIC 23 
RESEARCH  24 
 25 
RECOMMENDATION: 26 
 27 
Resolution 043 be referred.  28 
 29 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA support the diversification of genetic research to include 30 
subjects from multiple genetic ancestries; and be it further 31 
 32 
RESOLVED, That our AMA support the recruitment of individuals from underrepresented 33 
genetic ancestry groups for participation in genetic research studies, especially those 34 
regarding genetic risk; and be it further  35 
 36 
RESOLVED, That our AMA encourage the NIH to increase funding for outreach and 37 
recruitment of members of underrepresented genetic ancestry groups and the sharing of 38 
such deidentified genetic data with the scientific community; and be it further  39 
 40 
RESOLVED, That our AMA promotes public education regarding PRSs and genetic 41 
research participation in order to aid in the recruitment of diverse ancestry cohorts for 42 
future genetic studies; and be it further  43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 74 of 142 
 
 
 1 
RESOLVED, That the AMA amend Policy H -460.909, “Comparative Effectiveness 2 
Research,” by addition and deletion to read as follows:  3 
 4 
Comparative Effectiveness Research H -460.909 5 
The following Principles for Creating a Centralized Comparative 6 
Effectiveness Research Entity are the official policy of our AMA:  7 
PRINCIPLES FOR CREATING A CENTRALIZED 8 
COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH ENTITY:  9 
A. Value. Value can be thought of as the best balance between 10 
benefits and costs, and better value as improved clinical 11 
outcomes, quality, and/or patient satisfaction per dollar spent. 12 
Improving value in the US health care system will require both 13 
clinical and cost information. Quality comparative clinical 14 
effectiveness research (CER) will improve health care value by 15 
enhancing physician clinical judgment and fostering the delivery of 16 
patient -centered care.  17 
B. Independence. A federally sponsored CER entity should be an 18 
objective, independent authority that produces valid, scientifically 19 
rigorous res earch.  20 
C. Stable Funding. The entity should have secure and sufficient 21 
funding in order to maintain the necessary infrastructure and 22 
resources to produce quality CER. Funding source(s) must 23 
safeguard the independence of a federally sponsored CER entity.  24 
D. Rigorous Scientifically Sound Methodology. CER should be 25 
conducted using rigorous scientific methods to ensure that 26 
conclusions from such research are evidence- based and valid for 27 
the population studied. The primary responsibility for the conduct 28 
of CER a nd selection of CER methodologies must rest with 29 
physicians and researchers.  30 
E. Transparent Process. The processes for setting research 31 
priorities, establishing accepted methodologies, selecting 32 
researchers or research organizations, and disseminating findings 33 
must be transparent and provide physicians and researchers a 34 
central and significant role.  35 
F. Significant Patient and Physician Oversight Role. The oversight 36 
body of the CER entity must provide patients, physicians (MD, 37 
DO), including clinical practic e physicians, and independent 38 
scientific researchers with substantial representation and a central 39 
decision- making role(s). Both physicians and patients are uniquely 40 
motivated to provide/receive quality care while maximizing value.  41 
G. Conflicts of Interest  Disclosed and Minimized. All conflicts of 42 
interest must be disclosed and safeguards developed to minimize 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 75 of 142 
 
 
actual, potential and perceived conflicts of interest to ensure that 1 
stakeholders with such conflicts of interest do not undermine the 2 
integrity and legitimacy of the research findings and conclusions.  3 
H. Scope of Research. CER should include long term and short 4 
term assessments of diagnostic and treatment modalities for a 5 
given disease or condition in a defined population of patients. 6 
Diagnostic and treatment modalities should include drugs, 7 
biologics, imaging and laboratory tests, medical devices, health 8 
services, o r combinations. It should not be limited to new 9 
treatments. In addition, the findings should be re- evaluated 10 
periodically, as needed, based on the development of new 11 
alternatives and the emergence of new safety or efficacy data. 12 
The priority areas of CER should be on high volume, high cost 13 
diagnosis, treatment, and health services for which there is 14 
significant variation in practice. Research priorities and 15 
methodology should factor in any systematic variations in disease 16 
prevalence or response across groups by race, ethnicity genetic 17 
ancestry,  gender, age, geography, and economic status; and be it 18 
further  19 
I. Dissemination of Research. The CER entity must work with 20 
health care professionals and health care professional 21 
organizations to effectively disseminate the results in a timely 22 
manner by significantly expanding dissemination capacity and 23 
intensifying efforts to communicate to physicians utilizing a variety 24 
of strategies and methods. All research findings must be readily 25 
and easily accessible to physicians as well as the public without 26 
limits imposed by the federally supported CER entity. The highest 27 
priority should be placed on targeting health care professionals 28 
and their organizations to ensure rapid dissemination to those who 29 
develop diagnostic and treatment plans.  30 
J. Coverage and Payment. The CER entity must not have a role in 31 
making or recommending coverage or payment decisions for 32 
payers.  33 
K. Patient Variation and Physician Discretion. Physician discretion 34 
in the treatment of individual patients remai ns central to the 35 
practice of medicine. CER evidence cannot adequately address 36 
the wide array of patients with their unique clinical characteristics, 37 
co-morbidities and certain genetic characteristics. In addition, 38 
patient autonomy and choice may play a significant role in both 39 
CER findings and diagnostic/treatment planning in the clinical 40 
setting. As a result, sufficient information should be made 41 
available on the limitations and exceptions of CER studies so that 42 
physicians who are making individualized treatment plans will be 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 76 of 142 
 
 
able to differentiate patients to whom the study findings apply from 1 
those for whom the study is not representative.  2 
 3 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that the 4 
resolution is not reaffirmation of existing policies H -460.909, D- 350.981, and H -460.911. 5 
The House Coordination Committee slated Resolution 043 as reaffirmation of current 6 
policy that supports diversity in clinical research, but we agree that the resolution focuses 7 
specifically on genetic ancestry which is distinct from race and includes not only clinical 8 
research but also basic science research. However, your Reference Committee has 9 
concerns about the impact of this resolution as many initiatives including the NIH All of Us 10 
Project are col lecting genetic and health data with an emphasis on including individuals 11 
that have historically not been included in this type of research. The Reference Committee 12 
questions the impact of AMA action in this realm and whether the proposals including 13 
“outreach” and “public education” are the most efficacious method to improve genetic 14 
ancestry representation in research. Referral of this item would allow our MSS to gather 15 
more research and find the best solution to the problem. Your Reference Committee 16 
recomm ends Resolution 043 be referred.   17 
 18 
(51) RESOLUTION 049 - ADDRESSING GENDER- BASED DISPARITIES ON 19 
HEALTH- RELATED CONSUMER GOODS (THE PINK TAX) 20 
 21 
RECOMMENDATION: 22 
 23 
Resolution 049 be referred.  24 
 25 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA recognizes the existence of a gender -based disparity in 26 
health- related consumer goods; and be it further  27 
 28 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA will work with state medical societies to raise awareness of 29 
substantially similar health- related products that are priced differently based on the 30 
gender of the consumers and advocate for further regional study of this disparity.   31 
 32 
VRC testimony  was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that the 33 
evidence presented to support the gender -based disparity in healthcare goods is 34 
insufficient and outdated.   Your Reference Committee recommends referral to strengthen 35 
the evidence for gender -based disparities specifically in healthcare goods, the effect of 36 
this disparity on health outcomes, and further clarify the AMA's role in addressing this 37 
issue. We recommend that our MSS standing committees study the following questions 38 
1.) Is this res olution feasible? 2.) Are the asks of this resolution within the scope of the 39 
AMA? Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 049 be referred.   40

Page 77 of 142 
 
 
 1 
RECOMMENDATION: 2 
 3 
Resolution 063 be referred.  4 
 5 
RESOLVED, That our AMA recognize health -promoting civil legal services include but 6 
are not limited to legal services that support access to healthcare, safe housing and 7 
work environments, safeguards against financial exploitation, and assistance with family 8 
issues such as protection from abusive relationships, child support, and custody; and be 9 
it further  10 
 11 
RESOLVED, That our AMA recognize access to health- promoting civil legal aid services 12 
as a social determinant  of health.  13 
 14 
VRC testimony was mixed. Resolution 024 and 063 address very similar topics. We agree 15 
that these two resolutions would be best combined and referred to study to 1.) address 16 
evaluating the impact of recognizing civil legal aid services as a social determinant of 17 
health, 2.) determine the work that other medical education stakeholders, such as The 18 
American Association of Medical Colleges, have done on medical -legal education and 19 
related topics, and 3.)clarify the AMA's role in addressing this issue. We agree that referral 20 
will provide improved language and a clear path forward for AMA advocacy. Your 21 
Reference Committee recommends Resolution 024 and 063 be referred.   22 
 23 
(53) RESOLUTION 065 - ADDRESSING THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF 24 
DISCRIMINATION AND REJECTION ON LGBTQ YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE  25 
 26 
RECOMMENDATION: 27 
 28 
Resolution 065 be referred.  29 
 30 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA recognizes that LGBTQ youth are disproportionately 31 
represented in foster care systems where they are vulnerable to unique forms of 32 
maltreatment that both cause and exacerbate disparities in physical health, mental 33 
health, and overall well -being outcomes; and be it further  34 
 35 
RESOLVED, That our AMA supports federal and state legislation that establishes 36 
nondiscrimination protections within the foster care system on the basis of sexual 37 
orientation and gender identity; and be it further  38 
 39 
RESOLVED, That our AMA supports efforts by the Department of Health and Human 40 
Services and other appropriate stakeholders to establish reporting requirements and 41 
necessary privacy protections for the collection of sexual orientation and gender identity 42 
data in the Foster  Care Analysis and Reporting System; and be it further  43 
 44 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 78 of 142 
 
 
RESOLVED, That our AMA encourages child welfare agencies to implement practices, 1 
policies, and regulations that: (a) provide training to child welfare professionals, social 2 
workers, and foster caregivers on how to establish safe, stable, and affirming care 3 
placements for LGBTQ youth; (b) adopt programs to prevent and reduce violence 4 
against LGBTQ youth in foster care; (c) improve recruitment and tracking of foster 5 
families that are affirming of LGBTQ youth; and (d) allow gender diverse youth to be 6 
placed in residential foster homes that best align with their gender identity.  7 
 8 
VRC testimony was mainly supportive with amendments. Your Reference Committee 9 
agrees that this issue needs to be addressed, but we have concerns about the practical 10 
implication of nondiscrimination protections . We recommend that this resolution be 11 
referred to address the following questions: 1.) If a parent is considered discriminatory 12 
what are the practical implications? Does that mean they no longer are able to receive any 13 
foster children, thus putting more pressure on a system that is already without enough 14 
foster parents?  2.) Is this currently feasible? Your Reference Committee recommends 15 
Resolution 065 be referred.  16 
 17 
(54) RESOLUTION  066 - SUPPORTING POLICIES WHICH INCREASE BIOSIMILAR 18 
PENETRATION  19 
 20 
RECOMMENDATION: 21 
 22 
Resolution 066 be referred.  23 
 24 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA encourage the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 25 
(CMS) to implement systems for economically encouraging the uptake of biosimilars by 26 
physicians, including but not limited to setting rewards for volume targets and via shared 27 
savings programs; and be it further  28 
 29 
RESOLVED, That our AMA encourage the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to 30 
consider modifying its guidelines for the biosimilar ‘interchangeability’ designation; and 31 
be it further  32 
 33 
RESOLVED, That our AMA encourage the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 34 
Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division to closely scrutinize long- term exclusive 35 
contracts signed between biologics originators and PBMs to ensure they do not impede 36 
biosimilar development and uptake.   37 
 38 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 79 of 142 
 
 
VRC testimony was mainly  in opposition. Your Reference Committee agrees with 1 
testimony that the resolution lacks evidence and has questionable feasibility. We 2 
recommend referral of this resolution to study the following questions: 1.) What are the 3 
ethical impacts of incentivizing physicians for utilization of these products? 2.) Is there 4 
enough evidence to go against current AMA policy H -125.976 on the need for switching 5 
trials? 3.) Is “consider modifying” a strong and clear enough directive to enable the AMA 6 
to engage on interchangability guidelines? 4.) Is the third resolve a good use of AMA 7 
resources? Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 066 be referred.  8 
 9 
(55) RESOLUTION 078 - COVERAGE FOR CARE PROVIDED AFTER SEXUAL 10 
ASSAULT  11 
 12 
RECOMMENDATION: 13 
 14 
Resolution 078 be referred.  15 
 16 
RESOLVED, That AMA policy H -80.999 “Sexual Assault Survivors”  be amended by 17 
addition to include coverage for additional services following a sexual assault to reduce 18 
patient costs, as follows:  19 
 20 
 Sexual Assault Survivors  H-80.999  21 
1. Our AMA supports the preparation and dissemination of 22 
information and best practices intended to maintain and improve 23 
the skills needed by all practicing physicians involved in providing 24 
care to sexual assault survivor s. 25 
2. Our AMA advocates for the legal protection of sexual assault 26 
survivors’ rights and work with state medical societies to ensure 27 
that each state implements these rights, which include but are not 28 
limited to, the right to: (a) receive a medical forensic  examination 29 
free of charge, which includes but is not limited to HIV/STD testing 30 
and treatment, pregnancy testing and prevention, drug testing,  31 
treatment of injuries, and collection of forensic evidence; (b) 32 
preservation of a sexual assault evidence collection kit for at least 33 
the maximum applicable statute of limitation; (c) notification of any 34 
intended disposal of a sexual assault evidence kit with the 35 
opportunity to be granted further preservation; (d) be informed of 36 
these rights and the policies governing the sexual assault 37 
evidence kit; and (e) access to emergency contraception 38 
information and treatment for pregnancy prevention.   39 
3. Our AMA will support efforts to cover the cost of all medical 40 
care involved in the immediate management of all patients 41 
presenting after a sexual assault, regardless of insurance status.  42 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 80 of 142 
 
 
4. Our AMA will collaborate with relevant stakeholders to develop 1 
recommendations for implementing best practices in the treatment 2 
of sexual assault survivors, including through engagement w ith 3 
the joint working group established for this purpose under the 4 
Survivor's Bill of Rights Act of 2016.  5 
5. Our AMA will advocate for increased post -pubertal patient 6 
access to Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners, and other trained and 7 
qualified clinicians, in the emergency department for medical 8 
forensic examinations.  9 
6. Our AMA will advocate at the state and federal level for (a) the 10 
timely processing of all sexual examination kits upon patient 11 
consent; (b) timely processing of “backlogged” sexual assault 12 
exam ination kits with patient consent; and (c) additional funding to 13 
facilitate the timely testing of sexual assault evidence kits.  14 
 15 
VRC testimony was in opposition. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that 16 
resolution is well -intended, but the asks are not feasible. We appreciate that Illinois has 17 
adopted legislation on this issue and believe it could potentially be used as a model to 18 
strengthen future language. We agree that the resolution would be strengthened through 19 
further study and would urge the committees to address the following questions: 1.) Is this 20 
resolution feasible? 2.) How would the costs of this medical care be covered? 3.) What is 21 
the evidence for adding “drug testing” in clause 2? Your Reference Committee 22 
recommends Resolution 078 be referred.  23 
 24 
(56) RESOLUTION 083 - INDIAN WATER RIGHTS  25 
 26 
RECOMMENDATION: 27 
 28 
Resolution 083 be referred.  29 
 30 
Resolved, That our AMA:  31 
(1) Recognizes access to water as a public health crisis in American Indian and Alaska 32 
Native reservations and villages;  33 
(2) Will make it an organizational priority to work with relevant American Indian and 34 
Alaska Native stakeholder organizations, Tribal governmental leaders, and Tribal federal 35 
relations staff to secure additional resources for American Indian and Alaska Native 36 
sanitation, water treatment, and environmental support and health services;  37 
(3) Will work with state medical societies and associations and American Indian and 38 
Alaska Native Tribes and Villages to support Indian Water Rights litigation and federal 39 
Indian Water Rights legislation.  40 
 41 
VRC testimony was supportive. Your Reference Committee agrees with support for the 42 
spirit of the resolut ion, but we noted that some whereas clauses lack credible evidence. 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 81 of 142 
 
 
In order to bolster these asks, ee recommend this resolution be referred for study to find 1 
credible sources, specifically documenting these issues in broader areas and areas not 2 
initially supported in the whereas clauses (i.e. more than CO, AK, and NM), and compile 3 
more information to justify the resolve clauses. Your Reference Committee recommends 4 
Resolution 083 be referred.   5

(57) RESOLUTION 091 - HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS TO RESETTLE REFUGEES 7 
 8 
RECOMMENDATION: 9 
 10 
Resolution 091 be referred.  11 
 12 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA support increases and oppose decreases to the annual 13 
refugee admissions cap in the United States.  14 
 15 
VRC testimony was supportive. Your Reference Committee agrees that evidence provided 16 
by the Whereas clauses is unclear and appears to conflict with the asks of the Resolve. 17 
We recommend this resolution be studied thoroughly with strong, clear evidence to 18 
substantiate the asks. Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 091 be 19

RECOMMENDED FOR NOT ADOPTION 1 
 2 
(58) RESOLUTION 002 - FREE, INDIVIDUALIZED THERAPY FOR MEDICAL 3 
STUDENTS  4 
 5 
RECOMMENDATION: 6 
 7 
Resolution 002 not be adopted.   8 
 9 
RESOLVED, That our AMA will work with the Council on Medical Education to support 10 
options for medical schools to provide free, individualized therapy to medical students as 11 
a means to improve their mental and emotional well -being.  12 
 13 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with concerns that the 14 
resolution could have unintended risks of increasing the cost of medical school tuition and 15 
burden on medical students. We agree that the amendments proposed would move the 16 
resolution to be reaffirmation of H -345.973 and H- 295.898. The Reference Committee 17 
agrees with testimony that the resolution did not adequately support the need for free 18 
mental health services over affordable mental health services. Your Reference Committee 19 
agrees that medical schools should not limit the options available to students, including 20 
outside sources of mental healthcare and school -provided mental healthcar e. Your 21 
Reference Committee has also noted that asking our AMA to work with the Council on 22 
Medical Education is not a feasible or actionable ask. Your Reference Committee 23 
recommends Resolution 002 not be adopted.  24 
 25 
(59) RESOLUTION 003 - ADDRESSING SELF -DISCHARG E AGAINST MEDICAL 26 
ADVICE  27 
 28 
RECOMMENDATION: 29 
 30 
Resolution 003 not be adopted.   31 
 32 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA supports research and early identification of patients 33 
vulnerable to self -discharge against medical advice and promote interventions that 34 
ameliorate such disparities; and be it further  35 
 36 
RESOLVED, That our AMA study the ethics of nonmaleficence, liability, and justice 37 
regarding discharge against medical advice.  38 
 39 
VRC testimony was in opposition. Your Reference Committee agrees with the concerns 40 
of impact, feasibility, and the possible stigmatization of patients who choose to discharge 41 
against medical advice. We agree with testimony that the first resolve is not impactful, and 42 
the second resolve is outside the scope of the AMA. The Reference Committee 43 
recommends Resolution 003 not be adopted.   44

(60) RESOLUTION 004 - AMENDING D- 90.990 “EVALUATE BARRIERS TO 1 
MEDICAL EDUCATION FOR TRAINEES WITH DISABILITIES” TO REFLECT 2 
UPDATED APPROACHES AND LCME/COCA REQUIREMENTS  3 
 4 
RECOMMENDATION: 5 
 6 
Resolution 004 not be adopted.   7 
 8 
RESOLVED, That our AMA amends by addition and deletion D -90.990 “Evaluate 9 
Barriers to Medical Education for Trainees with Disabilities” to read as follows:  10 
 11 
Evaluate Barriers to Medical Education for Trainees with 12 
Disabilities D -90.990  13 
1. Our AMA urges that the Liaison Committee of Medical 14 
Education, Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation, 15 
and other relevant stakeholders require  all medical schools and 16 
graduate medical education (GME) institutions and programs to  17 
create, review, and revise technical standards, concentrating on 18 
replacing “organic” standards with “functional” standards  or  19 
“competency -based” standards that emphasize abilities rather 20 
than limitations, and that those institutions also disseminate these 21 
standards and information on how to request accommodations for 22 
disabilities in a prominent and easily found location on their 23 
websites.  24 
2. Our AMA urges all medical schools and GME institutions to: a) 25 
make available to students and trainees a designated, qualified 26 
person or committee trained in the application of the Americans 27 
with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 28 
1973, and available support services; b) encourage students and 29 
trainees to avail themselves of any needed support services; and 30 
c) foster a supportive and inclusive environm ent where students 31 
and trainees with disabilities feel comfortable accessing support 32 
services. 33 
3. Our AMA encourages the National Board of Medical Examiners 34 
(NBME), National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners 35 
(NBOME), and member boards of the American Board of Medical 36 
Specialties and the American Osteopathic Association to evaluate 37 
and enhance their processes for reviewing requests for 38 
accommodations from applicants with disabilities in order to 39 
reduce delays in completion of licensing and initial board  40 
certification examinations. This should include an assessment of 41 
the experience of those applicants and the development of a 42 
transparent communication process that keeps applicants 43 
informed about the expected timeline to address their requests. 44 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 84 of 142 
 
 
These processes should require neither proof of accommodation 1 
nor proof of poor academic performance prior to the time at which 2 
a need for accommodation was requested. 3 
4. Our AMA encourages research and broad dissemination of 4 
results in the area of disabilities accommodation in the medical 5 
environment that includes: the efficacy of established 6 
accommodations; innovative accommodation models that either 7 
reduce barriers or provide educational approaches to facilitate the 8 
avoidance of barriers; impact of disabled learners and physicians 9 
on the delivery of health care to patients with disabilities; and 10 
research on the safety of established and potential 11 
accommodations for use in clinical programs and practice.  12 
5. Our AMA will collaborate with the NBME and the NBOME to 13 
facilitate a timely accommodations application.  14 
6. Our AMA recommends adherence to the ADA 15 
recommendations in section 36.309 that requires the 16 
documentation requested by a testing entity to evaluate a request 17 
for testing accommodations be both reasonable and limited to only 18 
the information needed to determine the nature of an examinee’s 19 
disability and their need for the requested testing 20 
accommodations, as noted by the Civil Rights Division of the 21 
Department of Justice in their 2014 interpretation of this ADA 22 
provision.  23 
7. Our AMA will collaborate with key stakeholders to raise 24 
awareness regarding the process for applying and preparing for 25 
examinations, inclusive of requests for accommodations.  26 
 27 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with test imony that the 28 
proposed amendments to existing policy do not significantly change AMA’s advocacy. 29 
Specifically, the update to “competency -based standards” is not a substantial change to 30 
D-90.990 from an advocacy perspective. Your Reference Committee agrees  with 31 
concerns that educational accreditation bodies do not institute technical standards. Your 32 
Reference Committee recommends Resolution 004 not be adopted.  33 
 34 
(61) RESOLUTION 007 - THE STIGMA SURROUNDING “NONCOMPLIANT” 35 
LANGUAGE IN PATIENT CHARTING  36 
 37 
RECOMMENDATION: 38 
 39 
Resolution 007 not be adopted.   40 
 41 
RESOLVED, That the AMA study whether the addition of a qualifying “due to” clause 42 
after including the terms “noncompliant” or “nonadherent” in a patient chart is effective in 43 
reducing bias and stigmatization of patients; and be it further    44 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 85 of 142 
 
 
  1 
RESOLVED, Tha t the AMA encourage the use of “I” statements and motivational 2 
interviewing by providers with patients labeled as “noncompliant” or “nonadherent” to 3 
identify potential barriers in their access to healthcare.   4 
 5 
VRC testimony was in opposition. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that 6 
the first resolve is too prescriptive and outside the scope of the AMA. Your Reference 7 
Committee also notes that the AMA is not a research organization and asking the AMA to 8 
study the ask is not actionable. The second resolve is covered by existing policy H -30.942 9 
and we agree with testimony that this ask is not feasible or actionable as written. Your 10 
Reference Committee recommends Resolution 007 not be adopted.  11 
 12 
(62) RESOLUTION 009 - TREATING TRAUMATIC INJURY SURVIVORSHIP  AS A 13 
CHRONIC CONDITION 14 
 15 
RECOMMENDATION: 16 
 17 
Resolution 009 not be adopted.   18 
 19 
RESOLVED, That our AMA -MSS recognizes (1) the impact of traumatic injury 20 
survivorship on our healthcare and social resources; (2) the chronicity of comprehensive 21 
rehabilitation following traumatic injury; and be it further   22 
  23 
RESOLVED, That our AMA supports efforts to increase access to comprehensive care 24 
and improved quality of life strategies and interventions for traumatic injury survivors 25 
including, but not limited to, resilience screenings, multidisciplinary clinics, and 26 
appropriate long term care plans.  27 
 28 
VRC testimony was opposed to the resolution as written. Your Reference Committee 29 
agrees with testimony that the AMA has extensive policy addressing   chronic pain 30 
management, traumatic injury, and disability covering the asks of this resolution. We agree 31 
that the second Resolve would not have a significant impact on AMA’s advocacy efforts 32 
as specialty societies are working to address the issue. The Reference Committee 33 
reviewed amendments proffered and concluded that amendments do not increase the 34 
novelty of the ask. Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 009 not be 35 
adopted.   36 
 37 
(63) RESOLUTION 019 - SUPPORT FOR DIVERSITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF 38 
FORMAL CLINICAL CRITERIA FOR HAIR CURL PATTERN 39

Resolution 019 not be adopted.   43 
 44 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 86 of 142 
 
 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA support hair diversity as a relevant factor in providing 1 
culturally competent dermatological care and education; and be it further  2 
 3 
RESOLVED, That our AMA support relevant medical societies’ efforts to develop formal 4 
clinical criteria in identify ing hair types to improve medical education and patient care.  5 
 6 
VRC testimony was mainly in opposition. Your Reference Committee agrees with 7 
testimony that the authors did not provide enough evidence to show a clear link between 8 
misclassification of hair curl patterns to adverse health effects. We agree with the spirit of 9 
resolution but have concerns about the resolution’s evidentiary basis. Your Reference 10 
Committee recommends Resolution 019 not be adopted.  11 
 12 
(64) RESOLUTION 021 - INCLUSION OF HARM REDUCTION CURRICULA IN 13 
UNDERGRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION  14 
 15 
RECOMMENDATION: 16 
 17 
Resolution 021 not be adopted.   18 
 19 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA promote the inclusion of Harm Reduction education within 20 
current UME curricula as a key component to developing a physician workforce that are 21 
confident in their ability to work with patients experiencing substance misuse in a 22 
humane and compassionate manner; and be it further  23 
 24 
RESOLVED, That our AMA will work with relevant stakeholders to encourage medical 25 
schools to incorporate Harm Reduction education as part of their current UME curricula, 26 
acknowledging that appropriate knowledge, skills, and a ttitudes regarding substance use 27 
disorders can improve patient outcomes and reduce public health burden; and be it 28 
further  29 
 30 
RESOLVED, That our AMA encourages the development of a curriculum inventory and 31 
database in Harm Reduction practices and philosophy for use by medical schools in 32 
UME; and be it further  33

services continue to be implemented in order to further develop best practices in 2 
this area; (c) encourages the education of health care workers , undergraduate 3 
medical students,  and people who use drugs about the use of naloxone and 4 
other Harm Reduction measures in preventing opioid and other drug -related 5 
overdose fatalities; and (d) will continue to monitor the progress of such initiatives 6 
and respond as appropriate. 7 
2.Our AMA will: (a) advocate for the appropriate education of at -risk patients and 8 
their caregivers in the signs and symptoms of a drug- related overdose; and (b) 9 
encourage the continued study and implementation of appropriate treatments 10 
and risk mitigation methods for patients at risk for a drug -related overdose.  11 
3. Our AMA will support the development and implementation of appropriate 12 
education programs for persons receiving treatment for a SUD or in recovery 13 
from a SUD and their friends/families that address Harm Reduction measures. 14 
4. Our AMA will advocate for and encourage state and county medical societies 15 
to advocate for Harm Reduction policies that provide civil and criminal immunity 16 
for the possession, distribution, and use of “drug paraphernalia” designed for 17 
Harm Reduction from drug use, including but not limited to drug contamination 18 
testing and injection drug preparation, use, and disposal supplies.  19 
 20 
VRC testimony was mixed . Your Reference Committee agrees with testim ony that the 21 
resolution is covered under current policy D -160.981 and D- 95.987. Additionally, we agree 22 
with testimony that there is a lack of evidence for the deficiency of harm reduction 23 
education in undergraduate medical education and this resolution wil l not significantly 24 
impact current AMA efforts. Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 021 not 25 
be adopted.  26

RESOLVED, That our AMA support notification of conservatees  of their option to 1 
pursue Restoration of Rights and allow for informal requests for restoration to 2 
increase access to these options.  3 
 4 
VRC testimony was mixed . The Reference Committee agrees with concerns surrounding 5 
the resolution’s lack of evidence and novelty. The notification of an informal request for 6 
rights restoration is not proven to solve the problem . Your Reference Committee 7 
recommends Resolution 025 not be adopted.  8

 16 
RESOLVED, That  our American Medical Association strongly encourage the 17 
implementation of environmental justice into medical curriculum, during both preclinical 18 
and clinical training.  19 
 20 
VRC testimony supports the spirit of the resolution. Your Reference Committee agrees 21 
with testimony that the resolution asks are sufficiently addressed in MSS Transmittal 238. 22 
Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that there is not sufficient evidence to 23 
support the effectiveness of environmental justice training in undergraduate m edical 24 
education. Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 026 not be adopted.   25

 3 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with concerns that the 4 
proposed amendments largely re- word the existing policy without changing the content.. 5 
Additionally, we agree with testimony that the author’s amendments are covered by 6 
existing policy and would not significantly impact AMA’s advocacy efforts. Your Reference 7

 19 
RESOLVED, That our AMA recognizes that those participating in athletic activities on 20 
artificial turf are at an increased risk of injury compared to those performing the same 21 
activities on well- maintained natural grass.  22 
 23 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that the 24 
resolution is outside of the scope of the AMA. We agree with the spirit of the resolution, 25 
but the AMA is not the appropriate body to address this issue. Your Reference Committee 26 
recom mends Resolution 031 not be adopted.  27

(69) RESOLUTION 032 - ADDRESSING INCREASING MICROPLASTICS 29 
POLLUTION IN WATER AND THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF PLASTIC ON 30 
HUMAN HEALTH 31 
 32 
RECOMMENDATION: 33 
 34 
Resolution 032 not be adopted.   35 
 36 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA support efforts by the US Environmental Protection Agency 37 
to encourage relevant stakeholders to research efforts to reduce microplastic pollution, 38 
including but not limited to wastewater treatment plants and laundry machine removal 39 
filters; and be it further  40 
 41

VRC testimon y was opposed to the resolution as written. Your Reference Committee 1 
agrees with testimony that MSS Transmittal 230 covers the asks of the resolution and the 2 
proposed amendments will not significantly change AMA advocacy. The AMA is also not 3 
a research organization and AMA advocacy to encourage research is minimally impactful. 4 
Additionally, the MSS transmitted Resolution 936 on single- use plastics to the Interim 5 
2022 Meeting of the AMA House of Delegates and a report is due back at the Interim 2023 6 
Meeting.  We find that our current internal policies will allow the MSS to engage in 7 
productive discussion once the Report is released. Your Reference Committee 8 
recommends Resolution 032 not be adopted.  9

(70) RESOLUTION 042 - ADVOCACY FOR RESEARCHING THE BENEFITS AND 11 
COST-EFFICACY OF PATIENT NAVIGATION PROGRAMS OUTSIDE THE 12 
REALM OF ONCOLOGY  13 
 14 
RECOMMENDATION: 15 
 16 
Resolution 042 not be adopted.   17 
 18 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA supports research into the benefits of patient navigation in 19 
other clinical specialties outside of oncology; and be it further  20 
 21 
RESOLVED, That our AMA supports research into the cost -efficacy of patient navigation 22 
programs in other fields outside of oncology to better understand if patient navigation is 23 
cost- effective for hospitals to implement.   24 
 25 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee questions the need for further 26 
research into these programs since this resolution is already well cited. We also agree 27 
that the AMA has existing policy on expanding patient navigation programs H -373.994, 28 
and this resolution does not add feasible asks. Your Reference Committee recommends 29 
Resolution 042 not be adopted. 30 
 31 
(71) RESOLUTION 044 - IMPROVING MEDIGAP PROTECTIONS  32 
 33 
RECOMMENDATION: 34 
 35 
Resolution 044 not be adopted.   36 
 37 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA advocates for annual Medigap open enrollment periods and 38 
guaranteed lifetime enrollment eligibility for those enrolled in Medicare; and be it further  39 
 40 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA advocates that Medigap insurers offer lifetime Community 41 
Rated policies to protect against premium adjustments for age and health -related 42 
changes amongst Medicare enrollees. 43 
 44 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that the first 45 
Resolve is reaffirmation of H -165.856 and the second Resolve is in direct conflict with 46 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023)

existing policy and has unintended consequences. Further, the second Resolved clause 1 
is unsupported by the Whereas clauses and the evidence is insufficient. Your Reference 2 
Committee recommends Resolution 044 not be adopted.  3

(72) RESOLUTION 050 - UTILIZING SOCIAL WORKERS TO ADDRESS AND 5 
PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE  6 
 7 
RECOMMENDATION: 8 
 9 
Resolution 050 not be adopted.   10 
 11 
RESOLVED, That our AMA recognize the importance of social workers in hospital -based 12 
violence intervention programs and support more extensive research on the importance 13 
of having them as a core resource of hospital- based violence intervention programs.  14 
 15 
VRC testimony was opposed to the resolution as written.  Your Reference Committee 16 
agrees with testimony that the intent of this resolution is covered by existing policy and the 17 
asks will not impact AMA’s advocacy efforts. The AMA has recently instituted a Gun 18 
Violence Task Force as a result of a previously -authored MSS resolution and thus, this 19 
issue is covered under current policy and efforts. Your Reference Committee recommends 20 
Resolution 050 not be adopted.  21 
 22 
(73) RESOLUTION 051 - SUPPORT FOR PERSONS WITH SKIN -RELATED 23 
DISORDERS AND DISABILITIES  24 
 25 
RECOMMENDATION: 26 
 27 
Resolution 051 not be adopted.   28 
 29 
RESOLVED, That our AMA encourages physicians, health and human professionals, 30 
and other relevant agencies that involve persons with dermatologic conditions to 31 
recognize the unique burdens of dermatologic di sorders due to the visibility of skin 32 
lesions, psychiatric and psychological comorbidities, and chronic, refractory disease 33 
course; and be it further  34 
 35 
RESOLVED, That our AMA supports the inclusion of mental health screenings and 36 
increased accessibility to mental health treatment services, given the psychiatric and 37 
psychological comorbidities of dermatologic disabilities; and be it further  38 
 39 
RESOLVED, That our AMA will work with the American Academy of Dermatology, 40 
Society for Investigative Dermatology, Ameri can Society of Dermatopathology, and 41 
public health organizations to improve awareness of cutaneous disability assessments 42 
as well as dermatologic disabilities, especially in under -resourced patients.  43 
 44 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agree s with testimony that the first 45 
and second Resolves are reaffirmation of current policies supporting those with 46 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023)

disabilities, and the third Resolve will not elicit significant advocacy efforts from the AMA. 1 
We agree that the asks of this resolution are cov ered by current efforts from specialty 2 
societies. Your Reference Committee recommends that Resolution 051 not be adopted.  3

(74) RESOLUTION 053 - SUPPORT FOR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN 5 
CONSTRUCTION/BUILDING SAFETY STANDARDS  6 
 7 
RECOMMENDATION: 8 
 9 
Resolution 053 not be adopt ed.  10 
 11 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA encourages construction industry employees to receive 12 
training in building safety, and establishing better reporting channels and mechanisms in 13 
collaboration with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to reduce the 14 
mortality due to preventable deaths.  15 
 16 
VRC testimony was mainly in opposition. Your Reference Committee agrees with 17 
concerns that current Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) safety 18 
mechanisms were not mentioned as there is extensive regulation on constructi on 19 
standards/regulation by OSHA on this issue. We agree that the asks of this resolution are 20 
outside the scope of the AMA and will not change advocacy efforts. Your Reference 21 
Committee recommends Resolution 053 not be adopted.   22 
 23 
(75) RESOLUTION 059 - ADDRESSING  MISINFORMATION WITH AUGMENTED 24 
INTELLIGENCE  25 
 26 
RECOMMENDATION: 27 
 28 
Resolution 059 not be adopted.   29 
 30 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA support research into the use of Augmented Intelligence- 31 
powered chatbots to address online medical misinformation; and be it further  32 
 33 
RESOLVED, That our AMA supports research into the use of Augmented Intelligence to 34 
detect misinformation- spreading bots and general misinformation online.  35 
 36 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with concerns arising from 37 
the changing nature of the field and the limited impact the resolution is likely to have by 38 
only supporting studies. The authors have proposed amendments to make the policy 39 
internal. However, these amendments also change the policy from supporting research to 40 
supporting the use of AI chatbots, which seems beyond the scope of the evidence and 41 
current capabilities of this technology.. We agree with testimony that the technology is not 42 
fully developed and may have unintended consequences. Chatbots cited in the whereas 43 
clauses mainly focused on COVID -19, while the resolve clauses call for use of augmented 44 
intelligence chatbots for all medical misinformation. Further, the authors mention a 45 
Colorado COVID- 19 chatbot with an accuracy rate of 91.1% which is a concerningly low 46 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023)

accuracy rate for a bot aimed to reduce misinformation. Your Reference Committee 1 
recommends Resolution 059 not be adop ted.  2

EDUCATION CURRICULUM  6 
 7 
RECOMMENDATION: 8 
 9 
Resolution 062 not be adopted.   10 
 11 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA amends policy H -295.923 Medical Training and Termination 12 
of Pregnancy by addition and deletion as follows: 13 
 14 
Medical Training and Termination of Pregnancy, H -295.923  15 
1. Our AMA supports the education of medical students, residents and young 16 
physic ians about the need for physicians who provide termination of pregnancy 17 
services, the medical and public health importance of access to safe termination 18 
of pregnancy, and the medical, ethical, legal and psychological principles 19 
associated with termination of pregnancy.  20 
2. Our AMA will advocate for the availability of abortion education and clinical 21 
exposure to medication and procedural abortion for medical students and 22 
resident/fellow physicians and opposes efforts to interfere with or restrict the 23 
availabi lity of this education and training. by collaborating with relevant 24 
stakeholders . 25 
3. Our AMA will collaborate with relevant stakeholders to define comprehensive 26 
reproductive health, with explicit mention of termination of pregnancy, and 27 
include comprehensive reproductive health as a required curriculum topic or 28 
subtopic in preclinical undergraduate medical education.  29 
4.3. In the event that medication and procedural abortion are limited or illegal in a 30 
home institution, our AMA will support pathways for medical students and 31 
resident/fellow physicians to receive this training at another l ocation.  32 
5.4. Our AMA will advocate for funding for institutions that provide clinical training 33 
on reproductive health services, including medication and procedural abortion, to 34 
medical students and resident/fellow physicians from other programs, so that 35 
they can expand their capacity to accept out -of-state medical students and 36 
resident/fellow physicians seeking this training.  37 
6.5. Our AMA encourages the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical 38 
Education to consistently enforce compliance with the standardization of abortion 39 
training opportunities as per the requirements set forth by the relevant Residency 40 
Review Committees. 41 
 42 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that the 43 
action requested is outside of the scope of the AMA. Current initiatives by several key 44 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 96 of 142 
 
 
stakeholders address the resolution’s asks and further AMA policy would likely not 1 
meaningfully change our organizations advocacy efforts in this area. The Association of 2 
Professors of Gynecology & Obstetrics are in support of comprehensive reproductive care 3 
education in clerkship training already. While advocating for curriculum changes are  4 
largely outside the scope of the AMA past precedent for AMA support of medical education 5 
curriculum was discussed. Your Reference Committee finds that the precedent is more 6 
generalized for broader topics of public health -related topics and general healthc are 7 
funding knowledge.   We consider support of reproduction- specific curriculum to be a 8 
significant departure from past AMA policy precedent. Your Reference Committee 9 
recommends Resolution 062 not be adopted.   10 
 11 
(77) RESOLUTION 071 – INCREASING EDUCATION ABOUT AND ACCESS TO 12 
SUPPORTED DECISION -MAKING AGREEMENTS (SDMAS)  13 
 14 
RECOMMENDATION: 15 
 16 
Resolution 071 not be adopted.   17 
 18 
RESOLVED, That our AMA advocates for the use of supported decision- making 19 
agreements (SDMAs) as an alternative to guardianship; and be it further  20 
 21 
RESOLVED, That our AMA encourages schools to promote the full range of decision- 22 
making options for students with disabilities, including supported decision- making 23 
agreements; and be it further  24 
 25 
RESOLVED, That our AMA will collaborate with the American Academy of Pediatrics to 26 
increase provider and trainee knowledge on the use of supported decision- making when 27 
caring for individuals with disabilities.  28 
 29 
VRC testimony was opposed to the resolution as written. Your Reference Committee 30 
agrees with concerns regarding evidence and feasibility. We believe that MSS Transmittal 31 
233, “Conservatorship and Guardianship Reform,” conflicts with the resolution because 32 
the transmittal calls for a study on supported decision- making as an alternative to 33 
guardianship.   We find that the first proposed resolved clause is broadly covered by AMA 34 
Code of Medical Ethics Opinions on Consent, Communication 2.1.2 "Decisions for Adult 35 
Patients Who Lack Capacity," and we felt that resolved clause two was a specific use of 36 
resolved clause one.   We were further concerned with the AMA's scope and that school 37 
and legal focused advocacy for minors is not an appropriate focus for our healthcare 38 
organization. Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 071 not be adopted.   39

RESOLVED, That  our AMA will amend policy H -315.967 “Inclusive Gender, Sex, and 5 
Sexual Orientation Options on Medical Documentation” by addition and deletion to read 6 
as follows:  7 
 8 
Inclusive Gender, Sex, and Sexual Orientation Options on 9 
Medical Documentation, H -315.967  10 
Our AMA: (1) supports the voluntary inclusion of a patient's 11 
biological sexcurrent clinical sex , sex assigned at birth, current 12 
gender identity, legal sex on identification documents, sexual 13 
orientation, preferred gender pronoun(s), preferred chosen name, 14 
and clinically relevant, sex specific anatomy in medical 15 
documentation, and related forms, including in electronic health 16 
records, in a culturally -sensitive and voluntary manner , with efforts 17 
to improve visibility and awareness of transgender and gender 18 
diverse patients’ chosen name and pronouns in all relevant EHR 19 
screens and to de -emphasize or conceal legal name except when 20 
required for insurance and billing purposes; (2) Will advocate for 21 
the inclusion of an organ inventory encompassing medical 22 
transition history and a list of current present organs in EHRs, with 23 
efforts to link organ -specific examinations and cancer screenings 24 
to the current organ inventory rather than sex or gender identity; 25 
(23) Will advocate for collection of patient data in medical 26 
documentation and in medical research studies, according to 27 
current best practices, that is inclusive of sexual orientation, 28 
gender identity, and other sexual and gender minority traits for the 29 
purposes of research into patient and population health; (34 ) Will 30 
research the problems related to the handling of sex and gender 31 
within health information technology (HIT) products and how to 32 
best work with vendors so their HIT products treat patients equally 33 
and appropriately, regardless of sexual or gender identity;  (45) 34 
Will investigate the use of personal health records to reduce 35 
physician burden in maintaining accurate patient information 36 
instead of having to query each patient regarding sexual 37 
orientation and gender identity at each encounter; and (56 ) Will 38 
advoc ate for the incorporation of recommended best practices into 39 
electronic health records and other HIT products at no additional 40 
cost to physicians  automatically.  41

RESOLVED, That our AMA advocates for increased education and training on usage of 1 
gender identity and related transgender- inclusive functions in electronic healthcare 2 
records within healthcare institutions; and be it further  3 
 4

be it further  8 
 9 
RESOLVED, That this resolution be immediately forwarded to the AMA House of 10 
Deleg ates.  11 
 12 
VRC testimony was mixed and supportive of the spirit of the resolution. Your Reference 13 
Committee agrees with testimony that the asks of the second and third Resolves are 14 
covered under existing policy and the first Resolve is not actionable. Your Ref erence 15 
Committee notes that the current policy being amended was presented to the AMA several 16 
years ago by the MSS. At the time "clinically relevant, sex specific anatomy in medical 17 
documentation, and related forms, including in electronic health records" was interpreted 18 
as an organ inventory. We agree that the additions to this existing policy will not 19 
meaningfully change AMA advocacy and neither will further amendments. Your Reference 20 
Committee recommends Resolution 072 not be adopted.   21

(79) RESOLUTION 077 – SUPPLEMENTAL BREAST CANCER SCREENING FOR 23 
PEOPLE WITH DENSE BREAST TISSUE 24 
 25 
RECOMMENDATION: 26 
 27 
Resolution 077 not be adopted.   28 
 29 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA encourage the development of patient education materials 30 
regarding breast density, including the increased risk of missing breast cancer on 31 
screening mammography and appropriate supplemental screening; and be it further  32 
 33 
RESOLVED, That our AMA supports education for healthcare professionals, both in 34 
training and in practice, regarding breast cancer screening guidelines for individuals with 35 
dense breasts; and be it further  36 
 37 
RESOLVED, That our AMA amend policy H -525.977 Breast Density Notification by 38 
addition as follows:  39 
 40 
Breast Density Notification, H -525.977  41 
1. Our AMA supports the inclusion of breast tissue density 42 
information in the mammography report when appropriate and 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 99 of 142 
 
 
education of patients about the clinical relevance of such 1 
information, but  opposes state requirements for mandatory 2 
notification of breast tissue density to patients.  3 
2. Our AMA encourages research on the benefits and harms of 4 
adjunctive screening for breast cancer for women identified to 5 
have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening 6 
mammogram, in order to guide appropriate and evidence- based 7 
care and insurance coverage of the service.  8 
3. Our AMA supports insurance coverage for and adequate 9 
access to supplemental screening recommended for patients with 10 
“dense breast” tiss ue following a discussion between the patient 11 
and their physician which integrates secondary risk 12 
characteristics. 13 
4. Our AMA recognizes that dense breast tissue is one of many 14 
secondary risk characteristics for breast cancer;  and be it further  15 
 16 
RESOLVED, That our AMA amend policy H -525.993 Screening Mammography by 17 
addition as follows:  18 
 19 
Screening Mammography, H -525.993  20 
Our AMA:  21 
a. recognizes the mortality reduction benefit of screening 22 
mammography and adjunctive screening methods and supports 23 
its use as a tool to detect breast cancer.  24 
b. recognizes that as with all medical screening procedures there 25 
are small, but not inconsequential associated risks including false 26 
positive and false negative results and overdiagnosis.  27 
c. favors participation in and support of the efforts of professional, 28 
voluntary, and government organizations to educate physicians 29 
and the public regarding the value of screening mammography 30 
and adjunctive screening methods in reducing breast cancer 31 
mortality, as well as its limita tions.  32 
d. advocates remaining alert to new epidemiological findings 33 
regarding screening mammography and encourages the periodic 34 
reconsideration of these recommendations as more 35 
epidemiological data become available.  36 
e. believes that beginning at the age of  40 years, all women 37 
should be eligible for screening mammography.  38 
f. encourages physicians to regularly discuss with their individual 39 
patients the benefits and risks of screening mammography, and 40 
whether screening is appropriate for each clinical situation given 41 
that the balance of benefits and risks will be viewed differently by 42 
each patient.  43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 100 of 142 
 
 
g. encourages physicians to inquire about and update each 1 
patient's family history to detect red flags for hereditary cancer and 2 
to consider other risk factors for breast cancer, so that 3 
recommendations for screening will be appropriate.  4 
h. encourages physicians and patients to consider supplemental 5 
screening modalities, such as screening MRI and breast 6 
ultrasound, for patients with dense breast tissue.  7 
i. supports insurance coverage for screening mammography.  8 
j. supports seeking common recommendations with other 9 
organizations, informed and respectful dialogue as guideline- 10 
making groups address the similarities and differences among 11 
their respective recommendations, and adherence to standards 12 
that ensure guidelines are unbiased, valid and trustworthy.  13 
k. reiterates its longstanding position that all medical care 14 
decisions should occur only after thoughtful deliberation between 15 
patients and physicians.  16 
 17 
VRC testimony was  mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that the first 18 
Resolve  is reaffirmation of H -525.977 and the second Resolve is reaffirmation of H - 19 
525.993. The third Resolve would not significantly impact the AMA’s advocacy efforts. The 20 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has practice guidelines for 21 
screening mammography and the fourth Resolve conflicts with them. We agree with 22 
testimony that the resolution is not actionable. Your Reference Committee recommends 23 
Resolution 077 not be ad opted.  24

(80) RESOLUTION 079 – EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEMORRHAGE CONTROL 26 
KITS 27 
 28 
RECOMMENDATION: 29 
 30 
Resolution 079 not be adopted.   31 
 32 
RESOLVED, That our AMA amend the existing policy H -130.935 “Support for 33 
Hemorrhage Control Training” to promote inclusivity by addition as follows:  34 
 35 
Support for Hemorrhage Control Training, H -130.935  36 
1. Our AMA encourages state medical and specialty societies to promote the 37 
training of both lay public and professional responders in essential techniques of 38 
bleeding control.  39 
2. Our AMA encourages, through state medical and specialty societies, the 40 
inclusion of hemorrhage control kits (including pressure bandages, hemostatic 41 
dressings, tourniquets and gloves) for all first responders. 42 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 101 of 142 
 
 
3. Our AMA supports the  increased availability of bleeding control supplies with 1 
adequate and relevant training in public and private schools, places of 2 
employment, and public buildings.  3 
4. Our AMA supports the increased availability of bleeding control supplies 4 
through a capacity -based approach in large private recreational spaces, including 5 
but not limited to entertainment venues, stadiums, and parks, implemented with 6 
collaboration from local, community, and state- level stakeholders.  7 
5. Our AMA supports, through local, communit y, and state -level stakeholders, the 8 
implementation of cost -reduction measures including but not limited to price locks 9 
and loaner kit programs to increase the affordability and accessibility of bleeding 10 
control supplies by the lay public. 11 
 12 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that the 13 
amendment to clause three is not impactful, the amendment by addition of clause four is 14 
covered by current language, and clause five has a weak evidentiary basis. Additionally, 15 
The American College of Surgeons has made this issue a priority and has an active “Stop 16 
the Bleed” campaign. Your Reference Committee feels that the proposed amendments to 17 
existing policy are unlikely to meaningfully change AMA advocacy efforts or contribute to 18 
ongoing campaigns by other medical organizations. Your Reference Committee 19 
recommends Resolution 079 not be adopted.   20 
 21 
(81) RESOLUTION 081 – PATIENT PROTECTIONS FOR IMPLANTABLE MEDICAL 22 
DEVICES AND PROSTHETICS 23 
 24 
RECOMMENDATION: 25 
 26 
Resolution 081 not be adopted.   27 
 28 
RESOLVED, That our AMA supports legislation requiring companies to inform patients 29 
of business decisions or news that could negatively affect the function, maintenance, 30 
and monitoring of their medical devices or prosthesis in a timely manner; and be it 31 
further  32 
 33 
RESOLVED, That our AMA supports legislation that requires that companies producing 34 
implantable devices and prosthetics designate a surrogate in the event a company fails 35 
or is unable to provide the necessary monitoring and maintenance services; and be it 36 
further  37 
 38 
RESOLVED, That our AMA supports legislation requiring transparency for expected 39 
medical device and prosthetic repair and maintenance services and their subsequent 40 
costs prior to the implantation of a device; and be it further  41 
 42 
RESOLVED, That our AMA supports legislation encouraging payers to cover the costs 43 
of device maintenance, required upgrades, and remote monitoring of implantable 44 
medical devices and prosthesis; and be it further  45 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 102 of 142 
 
 
 1 
RESOLVED, That our AMA opposes planned obsolescence, thrott ling of effectiveness, 2 
unnecessary monitoring fees, and all other types of predatory subscription based models 3 
for the use of all prosthetics and implantable medical devices; and be it further 4 
 5 
RESOLVED, That our AMA amends Resolution D -480.991 “Access to Medical Care” by 6 
addition to read as follows:  7 
 8 
D-480.991 Access to Medical Care  9 
Our AMA shall work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 10 
Services to maximize access to the devices and procedures 11 
available to Medicare patients by ensuring reimbursement  at least 12 
covers the cost of said device or procedure as well as its expected 13 
maintenance, support, and monitoring fees . 14 
 15 
VRC testimony was opposed to the resolution as written. Your Reference Committee 16 
agrees with testimony Resolves 1 and 2 are not feasible; Additionally, there lacks evidence 17 
that patients are losing or struggling to access device maintenance after a company is 18 
unable to do so and lacks evidence supporting the designation of surrogates.   19 
 20 
Resolves 3, 4, and 6 are reaffirmation of existing policy; and Resolve 5 does not have a 21 
strong evidentiary basis. Our AMA has policy on device transparency D155.987 and 22 
coverage for devices H -480.943 and D -480.991; therefore, resolves 3, 4 and 6 will not 23 
meaningfully change AMA advocacy efforts. We agree with VRC testimony that there 24 
lacks evidence for planned obsolescence, throttling effectiveness, and unnecessary 25 
monitoring fees for prosthetics and implantable medical devices and therefore will not well 26 
received in the HOD.   27

United States, and how nutritional interventions integrated into clinical care can greatly 38 
benefit patients with complex, severe, or chronic illnesses; and be it further  39 
 40 
RESOLVED, That our AMA supports further research through larger -scale studies that 41 
investigate the cost -effectiveness of coverage, delivery, and efficacy of Food is Medicine 42 
interventions.  43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 103 of 142 
 
 
 1 
VRC testimony was in opposition to the resolution as written. Your Reference Committee 2 
agrees with testimony that recognizing the burden of chronic health conditions and  3 
supporting research into nutrition will not lead to substantial AMA advocacy efforts as our 4 
AMA has significant policy on improving access to healthy foods to fight chronic disease 5 
and improve public health. We agree that the resolution is well -written, b ut none of the 6 
amendments proffered increase the impact or actionability of the resolution and note that 7 
a resolution introduced for the 2023 AMA Annual Meeting addresses largely overlapping 8 
asks of this resolution. Further, the AMA is not a research organization and AMA support 9 
for research is minimally impactful. Your Reference Committee recommends Resolution 10 
082 not be adopted.   11

RECOMMENDATION: 16 
 17 
Resolution 086 not be  adopted.   18 
 19 
RESOLVED, The AMA will collaborate with the American Academy of Pediatrics in their 20 
efforts to increase the use of evidence- based supports for AI/AN parents and young 21 
children by promoting the use of home v isiting models, high- quality child care, and 22 
comprehensive pediatric care; and be it further  23 
 24 
RESOLVED, The AMA will collaborate with the Indian Health Service, Center for 25 
Medicare and Medicaid Services, Tribal authorities, state public health agencies, and 26 
relevant community organizations to increase the distribution of appropriate American 27 
Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) infant health and safe parenting materials in the spirit 28 
of self -determination to reduce infant mortality and improve overall health outcomes of 29 
AI/AN children.  30 
 31 
VRC testimony  was mixed. The House Coordination Committee placed Resolution 086 on 32 
the reaffirmation calendar due to its overlap with D -245.994, H -245.998, H -245.992, H - 33 
245.986, and H -350.976. Your Reference Committee agrees with  testimony that the first 34 
resolve details existing efforts and will not impact AMA efforts. Policy H- 350.976 covers 35 
the second resolve by supporting innovations to the betterment of AI/AN health needs. 36 
The Reference Committee recommends Resolution 086 not be adopted.  37

RESOLVED, That our AMA encourages wellness resources to include strategies for 10

 12 
VRC testimony was mixed between opposition and reaffirmation. Your Reference 13 
Committee agrees with the House Coordination Committee that the first and second 14 
Resolves are reaffirmation of existing policies H- 295.894 and H -60.930. Furthermore, we 15 
agree that resolution is not actionable because the first Resolve is a statement of fact and 16 
the third Resolve is not evidence- based and is not actionable. Your Reference Committee 17 
also notes that the third Resolved clause was not supported by evidence demonstrating 18 
that wellness resources which include strategies to improve sleep are  an effective means 19 
of increasing sleep quantity and quality. Your Reference Committee recommends 20 
Resolution 087 not be adopted.  21

Resolution 089 not be adopted.   28 
 29 
RESOLVED, That our  AMA promote mobile mammography units to screen eligible 30 
individuals for breast cancer in under -resourced regions, including but not limited to rural 31 
areas, medically underserved areas, and regions with limited mammography facilities, in 32 
order to address socioeconomic and geographic disparities in breast cancer screening; 33 
and be it further  34 
 35 
RESOLVED, That our AMA encourage the identification of optimal locations for mobile 36 
mammography units to increase access to breast cancer screening in under -resourced 37 
regions.  38 
 39 
VRC testimony was in opposition to the resolution. Your Reference Committee agrees 40 
with testimony that the resolution does not clearly quantify the problem and prove that 41 
mobile mammography units are an evidence- based, cost -effective   solution. We agree 42 
that there is not enough data on mobile mammography units to support the asks of the 43 
resolution. The Reference Committee reviewed amendments proffered to R2 and 44 
concluded that the amendments were neither well -supported nor feasible. There was also 45

deletion and the remainder of the report be filed:  14 
 15 
RESOLVED, That our AMA support federal and state efforts to make HIV Pre - 16 
Exposure Prophylaxis ( PrEP ) and Post -Exposure P rophylaxis (PEP)  prescribable 17 
by pharmacists through the establishment of Collaborative Practice Agreements 18 
with physicians. with evidence of a recent negative HIV test in accordance with 19 
best practice guidelines, including efforts to make rapid HIV tests available and 20 
affordable to patients requesting PrEP; and be it further  21 
 22 
RESOLVED, That our AMA support federal and state efforts to make HIV Post - 23 
Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) prescribable by pharmacists.  24 
 25 
VRC testimony was limited. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that the 26 
report lacks evidence to prove that the implementation of Collaborative Practice 27 
Agreements (CPAs) will improve accessibility to PrEP/PEP and patient outcomes. The 28 
report did not sufficiently address concerns of physician liability, feasibility, or 29 
administrative burden. Your Reference Committee noted several statistics lacking 30 
appropriate citations. Your Reference Committee believes this report will raise many 31 
concerns from AMA physicians of implications on expanding pharmacist scope of practice, 32 
including downstream effects on microbial resistance and patient follow -up. Your 33 
Reference Committee recommends  MSS COLA LBGTQ Report A not be adopted.  34

societies and professional organizations and relevant US departments such as the United 11 
States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement to 12 
ensure  that all asylum seekers can access screenings for torture and forensic medical and 13 
psychological evaluations free of charge by clinicians with relevant expertise in 14 
documenting experiences of torture in ways that identify the best approaches for medical 15 
intervention, including helping aid victims maintain legal residency status and avoid re- 16 
traumatization.   17 
 18 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that 19 
supports the spirit of the resolution; however, the asks of the resolution are already 20 
covered under existing policy H -65.981 which “urges appropriate support for victims of 21 
torture.” We find that existing AMA policy is sufficiently broad for the AMA to act on this 22 
issue already without adoption of new policy, which could result in limiting the ways in 23 
which the AMA could act on this specific case in this future Your Reference Committee 24 
recommends Policy H -65.981 be reaffirmed in lieu of Resolution 012.   25

 3 
VRC testimony was in support of reaffirmation. Your Reference Committee agrees with 4 
testimony from the House Coordination Committee that the resolution is covered under 5 
existing policy H -515.965. We agree that the resolution is vague and contradictory; the 6 
AMA has extensive policy on family and intimate partner violence and the asks of the 7 
resolution will not meaningfully impact our advocacy efforts. Your Reference Committee 8 
recommends Policy H -515.965 be reaffirmed in lieu of Resolution 014.   9 
 10 
Family and Intimate Partner Violence H -515.965 11 
(1) Our AMA believes that all forms of family and intimate partner 12 
violence (IPV) are major public health issues and urges the 13 
profession, both individually and collectively, to work with other 14 
interested parties to prevent such violence and to address the 15 
needs of survivors. Physicians have a major role in lessening the 16 
prevalence, scope and severity of child maltreatment, intimate 17 
partner violence, and elder abuse, all of which fall under the rubric 18 
of family violence. To suppor physi cians in practice, our AMA will 19 
continue to campaign against family violence and remains open to 20 
working with all interested parties to address violence in US society.  21 
(2) Our AMA believes that all physicians should be trained in issues 22 
of family and intimate partner violence through undergraduate and 23 
graduate medical education as well as continuing professional 24 
development. The AMA, working with state, county and specialty 25 
medical societies as well as academic medical centers and other 26 
appropriate groups s uch as the Association of American Medical 27 
Colleges, should develop and disseminate model curricula on 28 
violence for incorporation into undergraduate and graduate medical 29 
education, and all parties should work for the rapid distribution and 30 
adoption of such curricula. These curricula should include coverage 31 
of the diagnosis, treatment, and reporting of child maltreatment, 32 
intimate partner violence, and elder abuse and provide training on 33 
interviewing techniques, risk assessment, safety planning, and 34 
procedur es for linking with resources to assist survivors. Our AMA 35 
supports the inclusion of questions on family violence issues on 36 
licensure and certification tests.  37 
(3) The prevalence of family violence is sufficiently high and its 38 
ongoing character is such that physicians, particularly physicians 39 
providing primary care, will encounter survivors on a regular basis. 40 
Persons in clinical settings are more likely to have experienced 41 
intimate partner and family violence than non- clinical populations. 42 
Thus, to improve clinical services as well as the public health, our 43 
AMA encourages physicians to: (a) Routinely inquire about the 44 
family violence histories of their patients as this knowledge is 45 
essential for effective diagnosis and care; (b) Upon identifying 46 
patients currently experiencing abuse or threats from intimates, 47 
assess and discuss safety issues with the patient before he or she 48 
leaves the office, working with the patient to develop a safety or exit 49 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee (Annual  2023 ) 
Page 108 of 142 
 
 
plan for use in an emergency situation and making appropriate 1 
referrals to address intervention and safety needs as a matter of 2 
course; (c) After diagnosing a violence- related problem, refer 3 
patients to appropriate medical or health care professionals and/or 4 
community -based trauma- specific resources as soon as possible; 5 
(d) Have written lists of resources available for survivors of violence, 6 
providing information on such matters as emergency shelter, 7 
medical assistance, mental health services, protective services and 8 
legal aid; (e) Screen patients for psychiatric sequel ae of violence 9 
and make appropriate referrals for these conditions upon identifying 10 
a history of family or other interpersonal violence; (f) Become aware 11 
of local resources and referral sources that have expertise in 12 
dealing with trauma from IPV; (g) Be al ert to men presenting with 13 
injuries suffered as a result of intimate violence because these men 14 
may require intervention as either survivors or abusers themselves; 15 
(h) Give due validation to the experience of IPV and of observed 16 
symptomatology as possible sequelae; (i) Record a patient's IPV 17 
history, observed traumata potentially linked to IPV, and referrals 18 
made; (j) Become involved in appropriate local programs designed 19 
to prevent violence and its effects at the community level.  20 
(4) Within the larger comm unity, our AMA:  21 
(a) Urges hospitals, community mental health agencies, and other 22 
helping professions to develop appropriate interventions for all 23 
survivors of intimate violence. Such interventions might include 24 
individual and group counseling efforts, supp ort groups, and 25 
shelters.  26 
(b) Believes it is critically important that programs be available for 27 
survivors and perpetrators of intimate violence.  28 
(c) Believes that state and county medical societies should convene 29 
or join state and local health departments , criminal justice and 30 
social service agencies, and local school boards to collaborate in 31 
the development and support of violence control and prevention 32 
activities.  33 
(5) With respect to issues of reporting, our AMA strongly supports 34 
mandatory reporting of s uspected or actual child maltreatment and 35 
urges state societies to support legislation mandating physician 36 
reporting of elderly abuse in states where such legislation does not 37 
currently exist. At the same time, our AMA oppose the adoption of 38 
mandatory reporting laws for physicians treating competent, non- 39 
elderly adult survivors of intimate partner violence if the required 40 
reports identify survivors. Such laws violate basic tenets of medical 41 
ethics. If and where mandatory reporting statutes dealing with 42 
competent adults are adopted, the AMA believes the laws must 43 
incorporate provisions that: (a) do not require the inclusion of 44 
survivors’ identities; (b) allow competent adult survivors to opt out 45 
of the reporting system if identifiers are required; (c) provide that 46 
reports be made to public health agencies for surveillance purposes 47 
only; (d) contain a sunset mechanism; and (e) evaluate the efficacy 48 
of those laws. State societies are encouraged to ensure that all 49 
mandatory reporting laws contain adequate protect ions for the 50

reporting physician and to educate physicians on the particulars of 1 
the laws in their states.  2 
(6) Substance abuse and family violence are clearly connected. For 3 
this reason, our AMA believes that:  4 
(a) Given the association between alcohol and family violence, 5 
physicians should be alert for the presence of one behavior given a 6 
diagnosis of the other. Thus, a physician with patients with alcohol 7 
problems should screen for family violence, while physicians with 8 
patients presenting with problems of  physical or sexual abuse 9 
should screen for alcohol use.  10 
(b) Physicians should avoid the assumption that if they treat the 11 
problem of alcohol or substance use and abuse they also will be 12 
treating and possibly preventing family violence.  13 
(c) Physicians should be alert to the association, especially among 14 
female patients, between current alcohol or drug problems and a 15 
history of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. The association is 16 
strong enough to warrant complete screening for past or present 17 
physical, emotional, or sexual abuse among patients who present 18 
with alcohol or drug problems.  19 
(d) Physicians should be informed about the possible 20 
pharmacological link between amphetamine use and human violent 21 
behavior. The suggestive evidence about barbiturates and  22 
amphetamines and violence should be followed up with more 23 
research on the possible causal connection between these drugs 24 
and violent behavior.  25 
(e) The notion that alcohol and controlled drugs cause violent 26 
behavior is pervasive among physicians and other health care 27 
providers. Training programs for physicians should be developed 28 
that are based on empirical data and sound theoretical formulations 29 
about the relationships among alcohol, drug use, and violence.  CSA 30

disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer; (2) initiatives to reduce 8 
processed meats consumed in public schools, hospitals, food 9 
markets and restaurants while promoting healthy alternatives such 10 
as a whole foods and plant -based nutrition; (3) public awareness of 11 
the risks of processed meat consumption; and (4) educational 12

Education of Medical Students and Residents about Domestic 21 
Violence Screening H -295.912  22 
The AMA will continue its support for the education of medical 23 
students and residents on domestic violence by advocating that 24 
medical schools and graduate medical education programs 25 
educate students and resident physicians to sensitively inquire 26 
about family abuse with all patients, when appropriate and as part 27 
of a comprehensive history and physical examination, and provide 28 
information about the available community resources for the 29 
management of the patient  and any secondary victims . 30 
 31 
VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that existing 32 
AMA policy covers the asks of this resolution broadly as secondary victims are considered 33 
victims of domestic and intimate partner violence. Your Reference Committee thus does 34 
not find   the Resolved clauses to be novel or leading to new advocacy efforts. Your 35 
Reference Committee recommends that Poli cies H -515.965, H -185.976, H -515.952 be 36

1. Our AMA recognizes trauma -informed care as a practice that 1 
recognizes the widespread impact of trauma on patients, identifies 2 
the signs and symptoms of trauma, and treats patient s by fully 3 
integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, and 4 
practices and seeking to avoid re- traumatization.  5 
2. Our AMA supports:  6 
a. evidence- based primary prevention strategies for Adverse 7 
Childhood Experiences (ACEs);  8 
b. evidence -based trauma- informed care in all medical settings that 9 
focuses on the prevention of poor health and life outcomes after 10 
ACEs or other trauma at any time in life occurs;  11 
c. efforts for data collection, research, and evaluation of cost - 12 
effective ACEs screening tools without additional burden for 13 
physicians.  14 
d. efforts to educate physicians about the facilitators, barriers and 15 
best practices for providers implementing ACEs screening and 16 
trauma -informed care approaches into a clinical setting; and  17 
e. funding for schools, behavioral and mental health services, 18 
professional groups, community, and government agencies to 19 
support patients with ACEs or trauma at any time in life; and  20 
f. increased screening for ACEs in medical settings, in recognition 21 
of the intersectionali ty of ACEs with significant increased risk for 22 
suicide, negative substance use- related outcomes including 23 
overdose, and a multitude of downstream negative health 24 
outcomes.  25 
3. Our AMA supports the inclusion of ACEs and trauma -informed 26 
care into undergraduate and graduate medical education curricula.  27

1. Our AMA acknowledges that structural racism and bias 1 
negatively impact the ability to provide optimal health care, 2 
including maternity care, for people of color. 3 
2. Our AMA encourages physicians to raise awareness among 4 
colleagues, residents and fellows, staff, and hospital admi nistrators 5 
about the prevalence of racial and ethnic inequities and the effect 6 
on health outcomes, work to eliminate these inequities, and 7 
promote an environment of trust.  8 
3. Our AMA encourages physicians to pursue educational 9 
opportunities focused on embedding equitable, patient -centered 10 
care for patients who are pregnant and/or within 12 months 11 
postpartum into their clinical practices and encourages physician 12 
leaders of health care teams to support similar appropriate 13 
professional education for all members of their teams.  14 
4. Our AMA will continue to monitor and promote ongoing research 15 
regarding the impacts of societal (e.g., racism or unaffordable 16 
health insurance), geographical, facility -level (e.g., hospital quality), 17 
clinician -level (e.g., implicit bia s), and patient -level (e.g., 18 
comorbidities, chronic stress or lack of transportation) barriers to 19 
optimal care that contribute to adverse and disparate maternal 20 
health outcomes, as well as research testing the effectiveness of 21 
interventions to address each of these barriers.  22 
5. Our AMA will promote the adoption of federal standards for 23 
clinician collection of patient -identified race and ethnicity 24 
information in clinical and administrative data to better identify 25 
inequities. The federal data collection standards should be: (a) 26 
informed by research (including real -world testing of technical 27 
standards and standardized definitions of race and ethnicity terms 28 
to ensure that the data collected accurately reflect diverse 29 
populations and highlight, rather than obscure, critical distinctions 30 
that may exist within broad racial or ethnic categories), (b) carefully 31 
crafted in conjunction with clinician and patient input to protect 32 
patient privacy and provide non -discrimination protections, and (c) 33 
lead to the dissemination of best practices to guide respectful and 34 
non-coercive collection of accurate, standardized data relevant to 35 
maternal health outcomes.  36 
6. Our AMA supports the development of a standardized definition 37 
of maternal mortality and the allocation of resources  to states and 38 
Tribes to collect and analyze maternal mortality data (i.e., Maternal 39 
Mortality Review Committees and vital statistics) to enable 40 
stakeholders to better understand the underlying causes of 41 
maternal deaths and to inform evidence -based policies to improve 42 
maternal health outcomes and promote health equity. 43

7. Our AMA encourages hospitals, health systems, and state 1 
medical associations and national medical specialty societies to 2 
collaborate with non -clinical community organizations with close 3 
ties to minoritized and other at -risk populations to identify 4 
opportunities to best support pregnant persons and new families.  5 
8. Our AMA encourages the development and funding of resources 6 
and outreach initiatives to help pregnant individuals, their families, 7 
their communities, and their workplaces to recognize the value of 8 
comprehensive prepregnancy, prenatal, peripartum, and 9 
postpartum care. These resources and initiatives should encourage 10 
patients to pursue both physical and behavioral health care, strive  11 
to reduce barriers to pursuing care, and highlight care that is 12 
available at little or no cost to the patient.  13 
9. Our AMA supports adequate payment from all payers for the full 14 
spectrum of evidence- based prepregnancy, prenatal, peripartum, 15 
and postpartum physical and behavioral health care.  16 
10. Our AMA encourages hospitals, health systems, and states to 17 
participate in maternal safety and quality improvement initiatives 18 
such as the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health program and 19 
state perinatal quality collaboratives.  20 
11. Our AMA will advocate for increased access to risk -appropriate 21 
care by encouraging hospitals, health systems, and states to adopt 22 
verified, evidence- based levels of maternal care,  including low- 23 
intervention, patient -centered approaches for the intrapartum 24 
management of low -risk women in spontaneous labor; and be it 25 
further  26

VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with the House 31 
Coordination Committee that Resolution 020 is reaffirmation of existing policy H -185.917. 32 
While we support the spirit of the resolution, policy H -185.917 advocates for evidence- 33 
based maternal care. If the asks of this resolution are evidence- based, then they are 34 
covered by this existing AMA policy. Alternatively, if they are not evidence- based, your 35 
Reference Committee would be concerned that they may not be appropriate 36 
recommendations. Taken this together, your Reference Committee recommends Policy 37 
H-185.917 be reaffirmed in lieu of Resolution 020.  38

Legislation: Our AMA: (1) supports the development of model 22 
legislation which would provide for school education programs to 23 
teach adolescents about the dangers of drinking and driving and 24 
which would mandate the following penalties when a driver under 25 
age 21 drives with any blood alcohol level  (except for minimal blood 26 
alcohol levels, such as less than .02 percent, only from medications 27 
or religious practices): (a) for the first offense - mandatory 28 
revocation of the driver's license for one year and (b) for the second 29 
offense - mandatory revocation of the driver's license for two years 30 
or until age 21, whichever is greater; (2) urges state medical 31 
associations to seek enactment of the legislation in their 32 
legislatures; (3) urges all states to pass legislation mandating all 33 
drivers convicted of first and multiple DUI offenses be screened for 34 
alcoholism and provided with referral and treatment when indicated; 35 
(4) urges adoption by all states of legislation calling for 36 
administrative suspension or revocation of driver licenses after 37 
conviction for d riving under the influence, and mandatory 38

VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that existing 7 
policy H- 135.998 covers the asks of the resolution to address air pollution for subway cars 8 
and tunnels. H -135.998 specifically includes “particulates” as addressed in this resolution 9 
and calls for the “Maximum feasible reduction of all forms of air pollution” which would 10 
include air pollution both outdoors and in facilities including subway tunnels. Your 11 
Reference Committee recommends Policy H -135.998 be reaffirmed in lieu of Resolution 12 
036.  13 
 14 
AMA Position on Air Pollution H -135.998  15 
Our AMA urges that: (1) Maximum feasible reduction of all forms of 16 
air pollution, including particulates, gases, toxicants, irritants, smog 17 
formers, and other biologically and chemically active pollutants, 18 
should be sought by all responsible parties.  19 
 (2) Community control programs should be implemented wherever 20 
air pollution produces widespread environmental effects or 21 
physiological responses, particularly if these are accompanied by a 22 
significant incidence of chronic respiratory diseases in the affected 23 
community.  24 
 (3) Prevention programs should be implemented in areas where 25 
the above conditions can be predicted from population and 26 
industrial trends.  27 
 (4) Governmental control programs should be implemented 28 
primarily at  those local, regional, or state levels which have 29 
jurisdiction over the respective sources of air pollution and the 30 
population and areas immediately affected, and which possess the 31 
resources to bring about equitable and effective control.  32

VRC testimony was mixed. Your Reference Committee agrees with testimony that the 2 
asks of the resolution are covered under existing policy D -345.974. This policy specifically 3 
calls for the AMA to “prioritize education and outreach to those populations at highest risk 4 
for suicide attempts, suicide completions, and self -injurious behavior. ” People in 5 
occupations with access to lethal means are included within the highest risk population 6 
referenced in current AMA policy. In fact current AMA policy is stronger than the proposed 7 
resolution as it promotes education rather than supporting only research on this topic. 8

Truth and Transparency in Pregnancy Counseling Centers H - 7 
420.954  8 
1. It is AMA’s position that any entity that represents itself as 9 
offering health- relate d services should uphold the standards of 10 
truthfulness, transparency, and confidentiality that govern 11 
health care professionals.  12 
2. Our AMA urges the development of effective oversight for 13 
entities offering pregnancy -related health services and 14 
counseling.  15 
3. Our AMA advocates that any entity offering crisis pregnancy 16

and in their advertising, and before any services are provided to 20 
an individual patient; and b. be transparent with respect to their 21 
funding and sponsorship relationships.  22 
4. Our AMA advocates that any entity licensed to provide medical 23 
or health services to pregnant women a. ensure that care is 24 
provided by appropriately qualified, licensed personnel; and b. 25 
abide by federal health information privacy laws.  26 
5. Our AMA urges that public funding only support programs that 27 
provide complete, non- directive, medically accurate health 28 
information to support patients’ informed, voluntary decisions.  29

Improving Health Care of American Indians H -350.976  41 
Our AMA recommends that: (1) All individuals, special interest 42 
groups, and levels of government recognize the American Indian 43 
people as full citizens of the U.S., entitled to the same equal rights 44 
and privileges as other U.S. citizens.  45 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee (Annual  2023 ) 
Page 129 of 142 
 
 
(2) The federal government provide sufficient funds t o support 1 
needed health services for American Indians.  2 
(3) State and local governments give special attention to the health 3 
and health- related needs of nonreservation American Indians in an 4 
effort to improve their quality of life.  5 
(4) American Indian religions and cultural beliefs be recognized and 6 
respected by those responsible for planning and providing services 7 
in Indian health programs.  8 
(5) Our AMA recognize the "medicine man" as an integral and 9 
culturally necessary individual i n delivering health care to American 10 
Indians.  11 
(6) Strong emphasis be given to mental health programs for 12 
American Indians in an effort to reduce the high incidence of 13 
alcoholism, homicide, suicide, and accidents.  14 
(7) A team approach drawing from traditional health providers 15 
supplemented by psychiatric social workers, health aides, visiting 16 
nurses, and health educators be utilized in solving these problems.  17 
(8) Our AMA continue its liaison with the Indian Health Service and 18 
the National Indian Health Board and establish a liaison with the 19 
Association of American Indian Physicians.  20 
(9) State and county medical associations establish liaisons with 21 
intertribal health councils in those states where American Indians 22 
reside.  23 
(10) Our AMA supports and encourages fur ther development and 24 
use of innovative delivery systems and staffing configurations to 25 
meet American Indian health needs but opposes overemphasis on 26 
research for the sake of research, particularly if needed federal 27 
funds are diverted from direct services f or American Indians.  28 
(11) Our AMA strongly supports those bills before Congressional 29 
committees that aim to improve the health of and health -related 30 
services provided to American Indians and further recommends 31 
that members of appropriate AMA councils and c ommittees provide 32 
testimony in favor of effective legislation and proposed regulations. 33

Indian Health Service H -350.977  37 
The policy of the AMA is to support eff orts in Congress to enable 38 
the Indian Health Service to meet its obligation to bring American 39 
Indian health up to the general population level. The AMA 40 
specifically recommends: (1) Indian Population: (a) In current 41 
education programs, and in the expansion of educational activities 42 
suggested below, special consideration be given to involving the 43 
American Indian and Alaska native population in training for the 44 
various health professions, in the expectation that such 45 
professionals, if provided with adequate pr ofessional resources, 46 
facilities, and income, will be more likely to serve the tribal areas 47 
permanently; (b) Exploration with American Indian leaders of the 48 
possibility of increased numbers of nonfederal American Indian 49 
health centers, under tribal sponsor ship, to expand the American 50 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee (Annual  2023 ) 
Page 130 of 142 
 
 
Indian role in its own health care; (c) Increased involvement of 1 
private practitioners and facilities in American Indian care, through 2 
such mechanisms as agreements with tribal leaders or Indian 3 
Health Service contracts, as wel l as normal private practice 4 
relationships; and (d) Improvement in transportation to make 5 
access to existing private care easier for the American Indian 6 
population.  7 
(2) Federal Facilities: Based on the distribution of the eligible 8 
population, transportatio n facilities and roads, and the availability of 9 
alternative nonfederal resources, the AMA recommends that those 10 
Indian Health Service facilities currently necessary for American 11 
Indian care be identified and that an immediate construction and 12 
modernization program be initiated to bring these facilities up to 13 
current standards of practice and accreditation.  14 
(3)Manpower: (a) Compensation for Indian Health Service 15 
physicians be increased to a level competitive with other Federal 16 
agencies and nongovernmental se rvice; (b) Consideration should 17 
be given to increased compensation for service in remote areas; (c) 18 
In conjunction with improvement of Service facilities, efforts should 19 
be made to establish closer ties with teaching centers, thus 20 
increasing both the avail able manpower and the level of 21 
professional expertise available for consultation; (d) Allied health 22 
professional staffing of Service facilities should be maintained at a 23 
level appropriate to the special needs of the population served; (e) 24 
Continuing educat ion opportunities should be provided for those 25 
health professionals serving these communities, and especially 26 
those in remote areas, and, increased peer contact, both to 27 
maintain the quality of care and to avert professional isolation; and 28 
(f) Consideration should be given to a federal statement of policy 29 
supporting continuation of the Public Health Service to reduce the 30 
great uncertainty now felt by many career officers of the corps.  31 
(4)Medical Societies: In those states where Indian Health Service 32 
facilit ies are located, and in counties containing or adjacent to 33 
Service facilities, that the appropriate medical societies should 34 
explore the possibility of increased formal liaison with local Indian 35 
Health Service physicians. Increased support from organized 36 
medicine for improvement of health care provided under their 37 
direction, including professional consultation and involvement in 38 
society activities should be pursued.  39 
(5) Our AMA also support the removal of any requirement for 40 
competitive bidding in the Indian Health Service that compromises 41 
proper care for the American Indian population.  42

 13 
Reducing Inequities and Improving Access to Insurance for 14 
Maternal Health Care H -185.917  15 
1. Our AMA acknowledges that structural racism and bias 16 
negatively impact the ability to provide optimal health care, 17 
including maternity care, for people of color. 18 
2. Our AMA encourages physicians to raise awareness among 19 
colleagues, residents and fellows, staff, and hospital administrators 20 
about the prevalence of racial and ethnic inequities and  the effect 21 
on health outcomes, work to eliminate these inequities, and 22 
promote an environment of trust.  23 
3. Our AMA encourages physicians to pursue educational 24 
opportunities focused on embedding equitable, patient -centered 25 
care for patients who are pregnant and/or within 12 months 26 
postpartum into their clinical practices and encourages physician 27 
leaders of health care teams to support similar appropriate 28 
professional education for all members of their teams. 29 
4. Our AMA will continue to monitor and promote ongoing research 30 
regarding the impacts of societal (e.g., racism or unaffordable 31 
health insurance), geographical, facility -level (e.g., hospital quality), 32 
clinician -level (e.g., implicit bias), and patient -level (e.g., 33 
comorbidities, chronic stress or lack of transportation) barriers to 34 
optimal care that contribute to adverse and disparate maternal 35 
health outcomes, as well as research testing the effectiveness of 36 
interventions to address each of these barriers. 37 
5. Our AMA will promote the adoption of federal  standards for 38 
clinician collection of patient -identified race and ethnicity 39 
information in clinical and administrative data to better identify 40 
inequities. The federal data collection standards should be: (a) 41 
informed by research (including real -world test ing of technical 42 
standards and standardized definitions of race and ethnicity terms 43 
to ensure that the data collected accurately reflect diverse 44 
populations and highlight, rather than obscure, critical distinctions 45 
that may exist within broad racial or ethnic categories), (b) carefully 46 
crafted in conjunction with clinician and patient input to protect 47 
patient privacy and provide non -discrimination protections, and (c) 48 
lead to the dissemination of best practices to guide respectful and 49

non-coercive collectio n of accurate, standardized data relevant to 1 
maternal health outcomes.  2 
6. Our AMA supports the development of a standardized definition 3 
of maternal mortality and the allocation of resources to states and 4 
Tribes to collect and analyze maternal mortality data (i.e., Maternal 5 
Mortality Review Committees and vital statistics) to enable 6 
stakeholders to better understand the underlying causes of 7 
maternal deaths and to inform evidence -based policies to improve 8 
maternal health outcomes and promote health equity. 9 
7. Our AMA encourages hospitals, health systems, and state 10 
medical associations and national medical specialty societies to 11 
collaborate with non -clinical community organizations with close 12 
ties to minoritized and other at -risk populations to identify 13 
opportunities to best support pregnant persons and new families.  14 
8. Our AMA encourages the development and funding of resources 15 
and outreach initiatives to help pregnant individuals, their families, 16 
their communities, and their workplaces to recognize the value of 17 
comprehensive prepregnancy, prenatal, peripartum, and 18 
postpartum care. These resources and initiatives should encourage 19 
patients to pursue both physical and behavioral health care, strive 20 
to reduce barriers to pursuing care, and highlight care that is 21 
available at little or no cost to the patient.  22 
9. Our AMA supports adequate payment from all payers for the full 23 
spectrum of evidence- based prepregnancy, prenatal, peripartum, 24 
and postpartum physical and behavioral health care.  25 
10. Our AMA encourages hospitals, health systems, and states to 26 
participate in maternal safety and quality improvement initiatives 27 
such as the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health program and 28 
state perinatal quality collaboratives. 29 
11. Our AMA will advocate for increased access t o risk -appropriate 30 
care by encouraging hospitals, health systems, and states to adopt 31 
verified, evidence- based levels of maternal care.  Joint 32

Policy H -515.965  be reaffirmed in lieu of Resolution 088.  39 
 40 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA amends Family and Intimate Partner Violence, H- 515.965 by 41 
addition and deletion to include explicit mentions to emotional abuse as a form of intimate 42 
partner violence (IPV), the explicit identification, diagnosis, and treatment of perpetrators 43 
of IPV, including primary prevention strategies, and further research on emotional abuse, 44 
and IPV primary prevention strategies, as follows:  45 
 46 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 133 of 142 
 
 
(1) Our AMA believes that all forms of family and intimate partner 1 
violence (IPV)  including emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and 2 
physical abuse,  are major public health issues and urges the 3 
profession, both individually and collectively, to work with other 4 
interested parties to prevent such violence and abuse  and to 5 
address the needs of survivors. Physicians have a major r ole in 6 
lessening the prevalence, scope and severity of child maltreatment, 7 
intimate partner violence, and elder abuse, all of which fall under 8 
the rubric of family violence. To support physicians in practice, our 9 
AMA will continue to campaign against family violence and abuse,  10 
and remains open to working with all interested parties to address 11 
violence and abuse  in US society.  12 
(2) Our AMA believes that all physicians should be trained in issues 13 
of family and intimate partner violence through undergraduate and 14 
graduate medical education as well as continuing professional 15 
development. The AMA, working with state, county and specialty 16 
medical societies as well as academic medical centers and other 17 
appropriate groups such as the Association of American Medical 18 
Colleges, should develop and disseminate model curricula on 19 
violence abuse including emotional, sexual, and physical abuse for 20 
incorporation into undergraduate and graduate medical education, 21 
and all parties should work for the rapid distribution and adoption of 22 
such curricula. These curricula should include coverage of the 23 
diagnosis, treatment, and reporting of child maltreatment, intimate 24 
partner abuse and  violence, and elder abuse, and provide training 25 
on interviewing techniques, risk assessment for those at risk of 26 
perpetrating or experiencing IPV , relationship health education for 27 
all patients,  safety planning for those at risk of violence, the 28 
intersection of IPV risk factors with marginalized identity, and 29 
procedures to connect for linking  with resourc es to assist survivors 30 
and abusers with resources appropriate to each. Our AMA supports 31 
the inclusion of questions on family violence issues, including all 32 
forms of abuse,  on licensure and certification tests.  33 
(3) The prevalence of family violence and abus e is sufficiently high 34 
and its ongoing character is such that physicians, particularly 35 
physicians providing primary care, will encounter survivors and 36 
perpetrators on a regular basis. Persons in clinical settings are 37 
more likely to have experienced intimate partner and family violence 38 
than non- clinical populations. Thus, to improve clinical services as 39 
well as the public health, our AMA encourages physicians to: (a) 40 
Routinely inquire about the relationship health and family violence 41 
abuse histories of their  patients as this knowledge is essential for 42 
effective diagnosis and care; (b) Upon identifying patients currently 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 134 of 142 
 
 
experiencing abuse  or threats  from intimate  partner s, assess and 1 
discuss safety issues with the patient before he or she they leaves 2 
the office, working with the patient to develop a safety or exit plan 3 
for use in an emergency situation and making appropriate referrals 4 
to address intervention and safety needs as a matter of course;  (c) 5 
Upon identifying patients at risk of perpetrating violence or abuse 6 
towards intimate partners, educate the patient on healthy 7 
relationships and the lifelong impacts that these behaviors can have 8 
on those around them, and refer and strongly encourage the patient 9 
to join community primary prevention programs; (cd) After 10 
diagnosing an abuseviolence- related problem, ensure to educate 11 
the patient about the spectrum of abuse including emotional abuse, 12 
and refer patients to appropriate medical or health care 13 
professionals and/or community -based trauma- specific informed  14 
resources as soon as possible; (de ) Have Keep and maintain written 15 
lists of resources available for survivors of violence and abuse, 16 
providing information on such matters as emergency shelter, 17 
medical assistance, mental health services, protective services and 18 
legal aid, as well as resources to educate and empower survivors ; 19 
(ef) Screen patients for psychiatric  sequelae of  trauma caused by  20 
violence or abuse  and make appropriate referrals for these 21 
conditions upon identifying a history of family or other inter personal 22 
violence and abuse; (f g) Become aware ofSeek out  local resources 23 
and referral sources that have expertise in dealing with trauma from 24 
IPV; (g h) Be alert to men presenting with injuries suffered as a result 25 
of intimate violence because these men may require intervention as 26 
either survivors or abusers themselves; (hi ) Give due validation to 27 
the experience of IPV and of observed symptomatology as possible 28 
sequelae; (ij ) Record a patient's IPV history, observed trauma 29 
potentially linked to IPV, and r eferrals made; (j k) Become actively  30 
involved in appropriate local programs designed to prevent violence 31 
and abuse and its effects at the community level.  32 
(4) Within the larger community, our AMA:  33 
(a) Urges hospitals, community mental health agencies, and o ther 34 
helping professions to develop appropriate interventions for all 35 
survivors of intimate partner violence and preventative health 36 
education for all patients at risk of perpetrating violence and abuse. 37 
Such interventions might include individual and group counseling 38 
efforts, support groups, and shelters.  39 
(b) Believes it is critically important that programs be available for 40 
survivors and perpetrators of intimate violence. 41 
(c) Believes that state and county medical societies should convene 42 
or join state and local health departments, criminal justice and 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 135 of 142 
 
 
social service agencies, and local school boards to collaborate in 1 
the development and support of violence control and prevention 2 
activities. (d) Believes it is critically important to recognize emotional 3 
abuse as a more pervasive and common form of IPV than physical 4 
or sexual abuse, and to promote research to better understand 5 
emotional abuse, its prevention, and its impacts on the mental 6 
health of patients.  7 
(e) Believes it is critically important to pursue r esearch to deepen 8 
our understanding of the psychological and behavioral risk factors 9 
and sequelae associated with perpetration of violence and abuse in 10 
addition to primary prevention already mentioned in policy.  11 
 12 
VRC testimony was opposed to the resolution as written. Your Reference Committee 13 
agrees with testimony that Resolution 088 is reaffirmation of existing policy H -515.965 as 14 
emotional abuse is widely known to be a type of intimate partner violence. Your Reference 15 
Committee feels this resolution would not lead to meaningful change in AMA’s advocacy 16 
efforts and recommends Policy H- 515.965 be reaffirmed in lieu of Resolution 088.   17 
 18 
Family and Intimate Partner Violence H -515.965  19 
(1) Our AMA believes that all forms of family and intimate  partne r 20 
violence (IPV) are major public health issues and  urges the 21 
profession, both individually and collectively, to   work with other 22 
interested parties to prevent such violence  and to address the 23 
needs of survivors. Physicians have a  major role in lessening the 24 
prevalence, scope and severity of child maltreatment, intimate 25 
partner violence, and elder abuse, all of which fall under the rubric 26 
of family violence. To support physicians in practice, our AMA will 27 
continue to campaign against family violence and remains open to 28 
working with all interested parties to address violence in US society.  29 
(2) Our AMA believes that all physicians should be trained in issues 30 
of family and intimate partner violence through undergraduate and 31 
graduate medical education as well  as continuing professional 32 
development. The AMA, working with state, county and specialty 33 
medical societies as well as academic medical centers and other 34 
appropriate groups such as the Association of American Medical 35 
Colleges, should develop and disseminate model curricula on 36 
violence for incorporation into undergraduate and graduate medical 37 
education, and all parties should work for the rapid distribution and 38 
adoption of such curricula. These curricula should include coverage 39 
of the diagnosis, treatment, and reporting of child maltreatment, 40 
intimate partner violence, and elder abuse and provide training on 41 
interviewing techniques, risk assessment, safety planning, and 42 
procedures for linking with resources to assist survivors. Our AMA 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee (Annual  2023 ) 
Page 136 of 142 
 
 
supports the inclusion of questions on family violence issues on 1 
licensure and certification tests.  2 
(3) The prevalence of family violence is sufficiently high and its 3 
ongoing character is such that physicians, particularly physicians 4 
providing primary care, will encounter survi vors on a regular basis. 5 
Persons in clinical settings are more likely to have experienced 6 
intimate partner and family violence than non- clinical populations. 7 
Thus, to improve clinical services as well as the public health, our 8 
AMA encourages physicians to:  (a) Routinely inquire about the 9 
family violence histories of their patients as this knowledge is 10 
essential for effective diagnosis and care; (b) Upon identifying 11 
patients currently experiencing abuse or threats from intimates, 12 
assess and discuss safety issues with the patient before he or she 13 
leaves the office, working with the patient to develop a safety or exit 14 
plan for use in an emergency situation and making appropriate 15 
referrals to address intervention and safety needs as a matter of 16 
course; (c) After  diagnosing a violence- related problem, refer 17 
patients to appropriate medical or health care professionals and/or 18 
community -based trauma- specific resources as soon as possible; 19 
(d) Have written lists of resources available for survivors of violence, 20 
providing information on such matters as emergency shelter, 21 
medical assistance, mental health services, protective services and 22 
legal aid; (e) Screen patients for  23 
psychiatric sequelae of violence and make appropriate referrals for 24 
these conditions upon identifyi ng a history of family or other 25 
interpersonal violence; (f) Become aware of local resources and 26 
referral sources that have expertise in dealing with trauma from IPV; 27 
(g) Be alert to men presenting with injuries suffered as a result of 28 
intimate violence bec ause these men may require intervention as 29 
either survivors or abusers themselves; (h) Give due validation to 30 
the experience of IPV and of observed symptomatology as possible 31 
sequelae; (i) Record a patient's IPV history, observed traumata 32 
potentially linked to IPV, and referrals made; (j) Become involved in 33 
appropriate local programs designed to prevent violence and its 34 
effects at the community level.  35 
(4) Within the larger community, our AMA: (a) Urges hospitals, 36 
community mental health agencies, and other helping professions 37 
to develop appropriate interventions  38 
for all survivors of intimate violence. Such interventions might 39 
include individual and group counseling efforts, support groups, and 40 
shelters. (b) Believes it is critically important that programs be 41 
available for survivors and perpetrators of intimate violence. (c) 42 
Believes that state and county medical societies should convene or 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee (Annual  2023 ) 
Page 137 of 142 
 
 
join state and local health departments, criminal justice and social 1 
service agencies, and local school boards to collaborate in the 2 
development and support of violence control and prevention 3 
activities. (5) With respect to issues of reporting, our AMA strongly 4 
supports mandatory reporting of suspected or actual child 5 
maltreatment and urges state societies to support legisl ation 6 
mandating physician reporting of elderly abuse in states where such 7 
legislation does not currently exist. At the same time, our AMA 8 
oppose the adoption of mandatory reporting laws for physicians 9 
treating competent, non- elderly adult survivors of inti mate partner 10 
violence if the required reports identify  11 
survivors. Such laws violate basic tenets of medical ethics. If and 12 
where mandatory reporting statutes dealing with competent adults 13 
are adopted, the AMA believes the laws must incorporate 14 
provisions t hat: (a) do not require the inclusion of 15 
survivors   identities; (b) allow competent adult survivors to opt out 16 
of the repoprovide that reports be made to public health agencies 17 
for surveillance purposes only; (d) contain a sunset mechanism; 18 
and (e) evaluat e the efficacy of those laws. State societies are 19 
encouraged to ensure that all mandatory reporting laws contain 20 
adequate protections for the reporting physician and to educate 21 
physicians on the particulars of the laws in their states.  22 
(6) Substance abuse and family violence are clearly connected. For 23 
this reason, our AMA believes that:  24 
(a) Given the association between alcohol and family violence, 25 
physicians should be alert for the presence of one behavior given a 26 
diagnosis of the other. Thus, a physician with patients with alcohol 27 
problems should screen for family violence, while physicians with 28 
patients presenting with problems of physical or sexual abuse 29 
should screen for alcohol use. (b) Physicians should avoid the 30 
assumption that if they treat the problem of alcohol or substance 31 
use and abuse they also will be treating and possibly preventing 32 
family violence. (c) Physicians should be alert to the association, 33 
especially among female patients, between current alcohol or drug 34 
problems and a history of phy sical, emotional, or sexual abuse. The 35 
association is strong enough to warrant complete screening for past 36 
or present physical, emotional, or sexual abuse among patients 37 
who present with alcohol or drug problems. (d) Physicians should 38 
be informed about the  possible pharmacological link between 39 
amphetamine use and human violent behavior. The suggestive 40 
evidence about barbiturates and amphetamines and violence 41 
should be followed up with more research on the possible causal 42 
connection between these drugs and v iolent behavior. (e) The 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee ( Annual  2023) 
Page 138 of 142 
 
 
notion that alcohol and controlled drugs cause violent behavior is 1 
pervasive among physicians and other health care providers. 2 
Training programs for physicians should be developed that are 3 
based on empirical data and sound theoreti cal formulations about 4 
the relationships among alcohol, drug use, and violence.  CSA Rep. 5

Medical Spectrum of Gender D -295.312  4 
Given the medical spectrum of gender identity and sex, our AMA: 5 
(1) will work with appropriate medical organizations and community 6 
based organizations to inform and educate the medical community 7 
and the public on the medical spectrum of gender identity; (2) will 8 
educate state and federal poli cymakers and legislators on and 9 
advocate for policies addressing the medical spectrum of gender 10 
identity to ensure access to quality health care; and (3) affirms that 11 
an individual’s genotypic sex, phenotypic sex, sexual orientation, 12 
gender and gender identity are not always aligned or indicative of 13 
the other, and that gender for many individuals may differ from the 14 
sex assigned at birth.  Res. 003, A -17; Modified: Res. 005, I -18. 15

Health Care Needs of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and 34 
Queer Populations H -160.991  35 
1. Our AMA: (a) believes that the physician's nonjudgmental 36 
recognition of patients' sexual orientations, sexual behaviors, and 37 
gender identities enhances the ability to render optimal patient care 38 
in health as well as in illness. In the case of lesbian, gay, bisexual, 39 
transgender, queer/questioning, and other (LGBTQ) patients, this 40 
recognition is especially important to address the specific health 41 
care needs of people who are or may be LGBTQ; (b) is committed 42 
to taking a leadership role in: (i) educating physicians on the current 43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee (Annual  2023 ) 
Page 140 of 142 
 
 
state of research in and knowledge of LGBTQ Health and the need 1 
to elicit relevant gender and sexuality information from our patients; 2 
these efforts should start in medical school, but must also be a part 3 
of continuing medical educ ation; (ii) educating physicians to 4 
recognize the physical and psychological needs of LGBTQ patients; 5 
(iii) encouraging the development of educational programs in 6 
LGBTQ Health; (iv) encouraging physicians to seek out local or 7 
national experts in the health care needs of LGBTQ people so that 8 
all physicians will achieve a better understanding of the medical 9 
needs of these populations; and (v) working with LGBTQ 10 
communities to offer physicians the opportunity to better 11 
understand the medical needs of LGBTQ pat ients; and (c) opposes, 12 
the use of "reparative" or "conversion" therapy for sexual orientation 13 
or gender identity.  14 
2. Our AMA will collaborate with our partner organizations to 15 
educate physicians regarding: (i) the need for sexual and gender 16 
minority indiv iduals to undergo regular cancer and sexually 17 
transmitted infection screenings based on anatomy due to their 18 
comparable or elevated risk for these conditions; and (ii) the need 19 
for comprehensive screening for sexually transmitted diseases in 20 
men who have s ex with men; (iii) appropriate safe sex techniques 21 
to avoid the risk for sexually transmitted diseases; and (iv) that 22 
individuals who identify as a sexual and/or gender minority (lesbian, 23 
gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning individuals) 24 
experienc e intimate partner violence, and how sexual and gender 25 
minorities present with intimate partner violence differs from their 26 
cisgender, heterosexual peers and may have unique complicating 27 
factors.  28 
3. Our AMA will continue to work alongside our partner 29 
organizations, including GLMA, to increase physician competency 30 
on LGBTQ health issues.  31 
4. Our AMA will continue to explore opportunities to collaborate with 32 
other organizations, focusing on issues of mutual concern in order 33 
to provide the most comprehensive and up -to-date education and 34 
information to enable the provision of high quality and culturally 35 
competent care to LGBTQ people.  36

 1 
RECOMMENDATION: 2 
 3 
Policy D -430.997 be reaffirmed in lieu of MSS MIC CGPH Report A.  4 
 5 
Your Minority Issues Committee and Committee on Global and Public Health recommend 6 
adoption of the following recommendations in lieu of the proposed Resolve clause and the 7 
remainder of this report be filed:  8 
 9 
RESOLVED, That  our AMA supports conducting mental health 10 
screening, with validated measures, of all individuals entering or 11 
reentering the prison system in order to improve diversion practices 12 
as well as treatment access; and be it further  13 
 14 
RESOLVED, That our AMA advoca tes for the continuation of 15 
mental health care for individuals post -incarceration and the 16 
assessment of mental health needs by screening individuals upon 17 
release; and be it further  18 
 19 
RESOLVED, That our AMA supports continued research into other 20 
methods, including but not limited to universalized method and 21 
implementation of effective screening to identify mental health 22 
needs of incarcerated and post -incarcerated individuals.  23 
 24 
VRC testimony was limited. Your Reference Committee agrees that National Commission  25 
on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) guidelines are used as evidence to support the 26 
need for mental health screenings in prisons and existing policy D -430.997 already 27 
explicitly supports the NCCHC guidance including on mental health services. Further, this  28 
Report states “Subject -matter experts have been advocating for mental health screening 29 
in prisons and jails for decades.”   It is clear that the need for mental health resources in 30 
prisons and jails continues to exist; However, it is unclear that these proposed additions 31 
to AMA Policy would alter AMA advocacy in this area or that further AMA advocacy would 32 
significantly benefit initiatives by other invested federal organizations.  Your Reference 33 
Committee recommends that Policy D -430.997 be reaffirmed in lieu of MSS MIC CGPH 34 
Report A.   35 
 36 
Support for Health Care Services to Incarcerated Persons D- 37 
430.997  38 
Our AMA will:  39 
(1) express its support of the National Commission on Correctional 40 
Health Care Standards that improve the quality of health care 41 
services, includ ing mental health services, delivered to the nation's 42 
correctional facilities;  43 
the Medical Student Section Reference Committee (Annual  2023 ) 
Page 142 of 142 
 
 
(2) encourage all correctional systems to support NCCHC 1 
accreditation;  2 
(3) encourage the NCCHC and its AMA representative to work with 3 
departments of corrections and public offi cials to find cost effective 4 
and efficient methods to increase correctional health services 5 
funding;   6 
(4) continue support for the programs and goals of the NCCHC 7 
through continued support for the travel expenses of the AMA 8 
representative to the NCCHC, wit h this decision to be reconsidered 9 
every two years in light of other AMA financial commitments, 10 
organizational memberships, and programmatic priorities;  11 
(5) work with an accrediting organization, such as National 12 
Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCC HC) in developing a 13 
strategy to accredit all correctional, detention and juvenile facilities 14 
and will advocate that all correctional, detention and juvenile 15 
facilities be accredited by the NCCHC no later than 2025 and will 16 
support funding for correctional facilities to assist in this effort; and   17 
(6) support  an incarcerated person’s right to: (a) accessible, 18 
comprehensive, evidence- based contraception education; (b) 19 
access to reversible contraceptive methods; and (c) autonomy over 20 
the decision- making proces s without coercion.  21
