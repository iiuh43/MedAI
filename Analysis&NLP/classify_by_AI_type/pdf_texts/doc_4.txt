COMMUNITY RESOURCE GUIDE
Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation
State of Hawai i
2024 

Since the late 1990s, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (formerly known as the 
Department of Public Safety) has published a list of agencies and community service providers
available to assist offenders transitioning back into the community. With each passing year, 
these resources, both within government and in the community, experience change. While
there have been continuous improvements to the types of services available, this year's
publication remains focused on updating the existinglists in each of the individual counties
statewide.
The 2024 Community Resource Guide continues to be maintained by the Department's
Reentry Coordination Office whose mission is, to establish a process of transition for those
incarcerated, to utilize available and known resources, both in-facility and in collaboration with
community service providers, and to create arealisticbut sustainable model for success within 
the community. The purpose of this guide is to provide offenders and their families a listing of 
contact information for programs and services, as up to date at the timeof publication, as they
work towards a successful reentry.
The latest version of the Community Resource Guide can be located on our website at
www.dcr.hawaii.gov.Mahalo!

 BACKGROUND
The mission of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR) is to provide a secure correctional 
environment for comprehensive rehabilitative, holistic, and wraparound re-entry services, including 
culturally based approaches, to persons sentenced to our custody and care with professionalism, 
integrity, respect, and fairness. Our goal is to reduce recidivism and enhance the safety and security of 
our communities.  DCR oversees the state’s jails and prisons.   
 
Administration: Handles everything from training and staff development, personnel 
management, management of the operating budget, and capital 
improvements program budget. 
Corrections:  Oversees the state’s jails and prisons. Represents 85 percent of the 
department’s annual operating costs.
Rehabilitation Incorporates a variety of programs, resources, and services including 
Services and            education, substance abuse, job training, furlough opportunities, state 
Programs:               identification, and birth certificates. 
The department oversees four (4) jails and four (4) prisons in Hawai‘i that imprison roughly 5,300 of 
the state’s citizens. That includes approximately 1,450 prisoners in mainland facilities.
 
Jails:  Hawai‘i Community Correctional Center, Kaua i Community Correctional Center, Maui 
Community Correctional Center, and the O ahu Community Correctional Center. 
Prisons:  H lawa Correctional Facility, K lani Correctional Facility, Waiawa Correctional Facility, 
and the Women’s Community Correctional Center. All four prisons are located on the 
island of O ahu. 
 
The department submits annual reports to the Hawai‘i Legislature on its various programs.
 
The creation of this directory was influenced by an Offender Workforce Development Specialist (OWDS) 
Training Initiative which promoted collaboration between criminal justice agencies and community 
organizations to increase positive offender employment outcomes. In addition to the training, specific 
workgroups were created to address barriers related to offender reentry. Hence, the workgroup that laid 
the groundwork for this directory is called, “Pacific Resource.”  This directory is one of many strategies 
that will assist individuals in making a successful transition from prison/jail to the community. The 
development of this directory would not have been possible without the partnerships of and collaboration 
with many government and community agencies. Therefore, we would like to thank all those involved 
who worked tirelessly on this effort.  
 
This updated 2024 version has added a description of many of the agencies to help promote better usage 
of this directory. In addition, there has been great effort to list services across all counties.

Family Peace Centers promote peace and safety for Hawaii’s 
families and communities by providing support and education for 
those who use violence, survivors, and their children. Violent and

skills assures safety for survivors and children, promotes offender 
accountability, and solidifies an end to the cycle of violence in 
families and communities. Family Peace Centers emphasize 
partnership, equality and respect among and between all family 
members.

FINANCIAL AID 
Visit your school counselor for help in applying for financial aid. 
 
To receive federal student aid, you must meet the eligibility requirements listed on the Free Application for Federal 
Student Aid (FAFSA) website. If you were convicted for the possession or sale of illegal drugs before you enrolled in
