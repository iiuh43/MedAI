Survey Protocol 
Introduction  
(Rev. 37, Issued:  10-17- 08; Effective/Implementation Date:  10 -17-08) 
 
Hospitals are required to be in compliance with the Federal requirements set forth in the Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoP) in order to receive Medicare/Medicaid payment.  The goal of a hospital survey is to determine if the hospital is in compliance with the CoP set forth at 42 CFR Part 482
.  Also, where appropriate, the hospital must be in 
compliance with the PPS exclusionary criteria at 42 CFR 412.20 Subpart B  and the 
swing -bed requirements at 42 CFR 482.66  
 Certification of hospital compliance with the CoP is accomplished through observations, interviews, and document/record reviews.  The survey process focuses on a hospital’s performance of patient -focused and organizational functions and processes.  The hos pital 
survey is the means used to assess compliance with Federal health, safety, and quality standards that will assure that the beneficiary receives safe, quality care and services.  
 Regulatory and Policy Reference  
 
• The Medicare Conditions of Participation for hospitals are found at 42CFR Part 482
. 
 
• Survey authority and compliance regulations can be found at 42 CFR  Part 488 
Subpart A . 
 
• Should an individual or entity (hospital) refuse to allow immediate access upon reasonable request to either a State Agency or CMS surveyor, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) may exclude the hospital from participation in all Federal healthcare programs in accordance with 42 CFR 1001.1301
.  
 
• The regulatory authority for the photocopying of records and information during the 
survey is found at 42 CFR 489.53(a)(13).  
 
• The CMS State Operations Manual (SOM) provides CMS policy regarding survey 
and certification activities.  
 Surveyors assess the hospital’s compliance with the CoP for all services, areas and locations in which the provider receives reimbursement for patient care services billed under its provider number.  Although the survey generally occurs during daytime working hours (Monday through Friday), surveyors may conduct the survey at other times.  This may include weekends and times outside of normal daytime (Monday through Friday) working hours.  When the survey begins at times outside of normal work times, the survey team modifies the survey, 
if needed, in recognition of patients’ activities and the staff available.  
 All hospital surveys are unannounced.  Do not provide hospitals with advance notice of the survey.  Tasks in the Survey Protocol  Listed below, and discussed in this document, are the tasks that comprise the survey protocol for hospital.   
Task 1  Off-Site Survey Preparation  
Task 2  Entrance Activities  
Task 3  Information Gathering/ Investigation  
Task 4  Preliminary Decision Making and Analysis of Findings  
Task 5  Exit Conference  
Task 6  Post-Survey Activities  
 
Survey Modules for Specialized Hospital Services  
 The modules for PPS -exempt units (psychiatric and rehabilitation), psychiatric hospitals, 
rehabilitation hospitals and swing- bed hospitals are attached to this document.  The survey 
team is expected to use all the modules that apply to the hospital being s urveyed.  For 
example, if the hospital has swing- beds, a PPS excluded rehabilitation unit, and a PPS 
excluded psychiatric unit, the team will use those three modules in addition to this protocol to conduct the survey.  If the hospital is a rehabilitation hospital, the team will use the rehabilitation hospital module in addition to this protocol to conduct the survey.  If the hospital is a psychiatric hospital and if the survey team will be assessing the hospital’s compliance with both the hospital CoPs and psychiatric hospital special conditions, the team will use the psychiatric hospital module in addition to this protocol to conduct the survey.  
 Survey Team  
 Size and Composition  
 The SA (or the RO for Federal teams) decides the composition and size of the team. In general, a suggested survey team for a full survey of a mid- size hospital would include two-
four surveyors who will be at the facility for 3 or more days. Each hospital s urvey team 
should include at least one RN with hospital survey experience, as well as other surveyors who have the expertise needed to determine whether the facility is in compliance.  Survey team size and composition are normally based on the following fa ctors:  
 
• Size of the facility to be surveyed, based on average daily census;  
 
• Complexity of services offered, including outpatient services;  
 
• Type of survey to be conducted;   
• Whether the facility has special care units or off -site clinics or locations;  
 
• Whether the facility has a historical pattern of serious deficiencies or complaints; and 
 
• Whether new surveyors are to accompany a team as part of their training.  
 Training for Hospital Surveyors  
 Hospital surveyors should have the necessary training and experience to conduct a hospital survey.  Attendance at a Basic Hospital Surveyor Training Course is suggested.  New surveyors may accompany the team as part of their training prior to completing the Basic Hospital Surveyor Training Course. 
 Team Coordinator  
 
The survey is conducted under the leadership of a team coordinator.  The SA (or the RO for Federal teams) should designate the team coordinator.  The team coordinator is responsible 
for assuring that all survey preparation and survey activities are completed within the 
specified time frames and in a manner consistent with this protocol, SOM, and SA 
procedures.  Responsibilities of the team coordinator include:  
 
• Scheduling the date and time of survey activities;  
 
• Acting as the spokesperson for the team;  
 
• Assigning staff to areas of the hospital or tasks for the survey;  
 
• Facilitating time management; 
 
• Encouraging on- going communication among team members;  
 
• Evaluating team progress and coordinating daily team meetings;  
 
• Coordinating any ongoing conferences with hospital leadership (as determined 
appropriate by the circumstances and SA/RO policy) and providing on- going 
feedback, as appropriate, to hospital leadership on the status of the survey;  
 
• Coordinating Task 2, Entrance Conference;  
 
• Facilitating Task 4, Preliminary Decision Making; 
 
• Coordinating Task 5, Exit Conference; and  
 
• Coordinating the preparation of the Form CMS -2567.  
 
Task 1 - Off-Site Survey Preparation  
 General Objective  
 The objective of this task is to analyze information about the provider in order to identify areas of potential concern to be investigated during the survey and to determine if those areas, or any special features of the provider (e.g., provider -based clinics, remote locations, 
satellites, specialty units, PPS -exempt units, services offered, etc.) require the addition of 
any specialty surveyors to the team.  Information obtained about the provider will also allow the SA (or the RO for Federal teams) to determine survey team size and com position, 
and to develop a preliminary survey plan.  The type of provider information needed includes:  
 
• Information from the provider file (to be updated on the survey using the Hospital/CAH Medicare Database Worksheet), such as the facility’s ownership, the type(s) of services offered, any prospective payment system (PPS) exclusion(s), whether the facility is a provider of swing- bed services, and the number, type and 
location of any off -site locations; 
 
• Previous Federal and state survey results for patterns, number, and nature of deficiencies, as well as the number, frequency, and types of complaint investigations and the findings;  
 
• Information from CMS databases available to the SA and CMS.  Note the exit date of the most recent survey;  
 
• Waivers and variances, if they exist.  Determine if there are any applicable survey directive(s) from the SA or the CMS Regional Office (RO); and  
 
• Any additional information available about the facility (e.g., the hospital’s Web site, 
any media reports about the hospital, etc). 
 Off-Site Survey Preparation Team Meeting  
 The team should prepare for the survey offsite so they are ready to begin the survey immediately upon entering the facility. The team coordinator should arrange an off- site 
preparation meeting with as many team members as possible, including specialty surveyors.  This meeting may be a conference call if necessary.   During the meeting, discuss at least the following:  
• Information gathered by the team coordinator;  
• Significant information from the CMS databases that are reviewed;  
 
• Update and clarify information from the provider file so a surveyor can update the 
Medicare database using the “Hospital/CAH Medicare Database Worksheet,” 
Exhibit 286;
 
 
• Layout of the facility (if available);  
 
• Preliminary team member assignments;  
• Date, location and time team members will meet to enter the facility;  
• The time for the daily team meetings; and  
 
• Potential date and time of the exit conference.  
 Gather copies of resources that may be needed.  These may include:  
• Medicare Hospital CoP and Interpretive Guidelines ( Appendix A
); 
 
• Survey protocol and modules; 
 
• Immediate Jeopardy ( Appendix Q ); 
 
• Responsibilities of Medicare Participating Hospitals in Emergency Cases 
(Appendix V ); 
 
• Hospital Swing -Bed Regulations and Interpretive Guidelines ( Appendix T );  
 
• Hospital/CAH Medicare Database Worksheet, Exhibit 286 ; 
 
• Exhibit 287 ,  Authorization by Deemed Provider/Supplier Selected for 
Accreditation Organization Validation Survey; and 
 
• Worksheets for swing-bed, PPS exclusions, and restraint/seclusion death reporting. 
 
Task 2 - Entrance Activities  
 
General Objectives  
 The objectives of this task are to explain the survey process to the hospital and obtain the 
information needed to conduct the survey.  
 
General Procedures  
 Arrival  
 The entire survey team should enter the hospital together.  Upon arrival, surveyors should present their identification.  The team coordinator should announce to the Administrator, or whoever is in charge, that a survey is being conducted.  If the Administ rator (or person in 
charge) is not onsite or available (e.g., if the survey begins outside normal daytime Monday- Friday working hours), ask that they be notified that a survey is being conducted.  
Do not delay the survey because the Administrator or other hospital staff is/are not on site or available.  
 Entrance Conference  
 The entrance conference sets the tone for the entire survey.  Be prepared and courteous, and make requests, not demands. The entrance conference should be informative, concise, and brief; it should not utilize a significant amount of time. Conduct the entrance  conference 
with hospital administrative staff that is available at the time of entrance.  During the entrance conference, the Team Coordinator should address the following:  
 
• Explain the purpose and scope of the survey;  
 
• Briefly explain the survey process;  
 
• Introduce survey team members, including any additional surveyors who may join the team at a later time, the general area that each will be responsible for, and the various documents that they may request;  
 
• Clarify that all hospital areas and locations, departments, and patient care settings under the hospital provider number may be surveyed, including any contracted patient care activities or patient services located on hospital campuses or hospital provider  based locations;  
 
• Explain that all interviews will be conducted privately with patients, staff, and 
visitors, unless requested otherwise by the interviewee;  
 
• Discuss and determine how the facility will ensure that surveyors are able to obtain 
the photocopies of material, records, and other information as they are needed;   
• Obtain the names, locations, and telephone numbers of key staff to whom questions should be addressed;  
 
• Discuss the approximate time, location, and possible attendees of any meetings to be held during the survey.  The team coordinator should coordinate any meetings with facility leadership; and  
 
• Propose a preliminary date and time for the exit conference.  
 During the entrance conference, the Team Coordinator will arrange with the hospital administrator, or available hospital administrative supervisory staff if he/she is unavailable to obtain the following:  
 
• A location (e.g., conference room) where the team may meet privately during the survey;  
 
• A telephone for team communications, preferably in the team meeting location;  
 
• A list of current inpatients , providing each patient’s name, room number, 
diagnosis(es), admission date, age, attending physician, and other significant 
information as it applies to that patient. The team coordinator will explain to the hospital that in order to complete the survey wit hin the allotted time it is important 
the survey team is given this information as soon as possible, and request that it be no later than 3 hours after the request is made. SAs may develop a worksheet to give to the facility f or obtaining this information;  
 
• A list of department heads with their locations and telephone numbers;  
 
• A copy of the facility’s organizational chart;  
 
• The names and addresses of all off -site locations operating under the same provider 
number;  
 
• The hospital’s infection control plan;  
 
• A list of employees; 
 
• The medical staff bylaws and rules and regulations;   
• A list of contracted services; and  
 
• A copy of the facility’s floor plan, indicating the location of patient care and 
treatment areas;  
 
Arrange an interview with a member of the administrative staff to complete the 
Hospital/CAH Medicare Database Worksheet that will be used to update the provider’s file in the Medicare database.  The worksheet may not be given to hospital personnel for comp letion.   
 Hospital Tours  
 Guided tours of the hospital are not encouraged and should be avoided.  While a tour of a small facility may take place in less than one -man hour, a tour of a large facility could 
consume several man hours of allocated survey time and resources that are needed to conduct the survey.  
 Initial On -Site Team Meeting  
 After the conclusion of the Entrance Conference, the team will meet in order to evaluate information gathered, and modify surveyor assignments, as necessary.  Do not delay the continuation of the survey process waiting for information from the provider, but adjust survey activities as necessary.  During the on- site team meeting, team members should: 
 
• Review the scope of hospital services;  
 
• Identify hospital locations to be surveyed, including any off -site locations; 
 
• Add survey protocol modules and adjust surveyor assignments, as necessary, based on new information;  
 
• Discuss issues such as change of ownership, sentinel events, construction activities, 
and disasters, if they have been reported;  
 
• Make an initial patient sample selection (The patient list may not be available 
immediately after the entrance conference, therefore the team may delay completing the initial patient sample selection a few hours as meets the needs of the survey team); and  
 
• Set the next meeting time and date.  
 Sample Size and Selection  
 To select the patient sample, review the patient list provided by the hospital and select patients who represent a cross -section of the patient population and the services provided.  
Patient logs (ER, OB, OR, restraint, etc) may be used in conjunction with the patient list to assure the sample is reflective of the scope of services provided by the hospital.  Whenever possible and appropriate, select patients who are in the facility during the time of survey (i.e., open records).  Open records allow surveyors to conduct a patient -focused 
survey and enable surveyors to validate the information obtained through r ecord reviews 
with observations and patient and staff interviews.  There may be situations where closed records are needed to supplement the open records reviewed (e.g., too few open records, complaint investigation, etc), surveyors should use their profes sional judgment in these 
situations and select sample that will enable them to make compliance determinations.  If it is necessary to remove a patient from the sample during the survey, (e.g., the patient refuses to participate in an interview), replace th e patient with another who fits a similar profile.  
This should be done as soon as possible in the survey.  
Select the number of patient records for review based on the facility’s average daily census.  The sample should be at least 10 percent of the average daily census, but not fewer than 30 inpatient records.  For small general hospitals (this reduction does not apply to surgical or other specialty hospitals) with an average daily census of 20 patients or less, the sample should not be fewer than 20 inpatient records, provided that number of records is adequate to determine compliance.  Within the sample, sele ct at least one patient from each nursing 
unit (e.g., med/surg, ICU, OB, pediatrics, specialty units, etc).  In addition to the inpatient sample, select a sample of outpatients in order to determine compliance in outpatient departments, services, and locat ions.  The sample size may be expanded as needed to assess 
the hospital’s compliance with the CoP.  
 If a complaint is being investigated during the survey, include patients who have been identified as part of the complaint in the sample.  Issues or concerns identified through complaints may be an area of focus when selecting the patient sample.  
 Give each patient in the sample a unique identifier.  Appropriate identifiable information should be kept on a separate identifier list. Do not use medical record numbers, Social Security numbers, care unit or billing record numbers to identify patients.  
 To conduct an initial survey of a hospital there must be enough inpatients currently in the hospital and patient records (open and closed) for surveyors to determine whether the hospital can demonstrate compliance with all the applicable CoP. The number of  current 
and discharged inpatients and outpatients in relation to the complexity of care provided to patients and the length of stay of those patients needs to be large enough for surveyors to evaluate the manner and degree to which the hospital satisfies all the standards within each CoP including any CoP applying to optional services offered by the hospital.  Utilize the same sample size and selection methods as previously discussed.  
 
Task 3 - Information Gathering/Investigation  
 
General Objective  
 
The objective of this task is to determine the hospital’s compliance with the Medicare CoP through observations, interviews, and document review.  Guiding Principles  
 
• Focus attention on actual and potential patient outcomes, as well as required processes.  
 
• Assess the care and services provided, including the appropriateness of the care and services within the context of the regulations.    
• Visit patient care settings, including inpatient units, outpatient clinics, anesthetizing locations, emergency departments, imaging, rehabilitation, remote locations, satellites, etc.   
• Observe the actual provision of care and services to patients and the effects of that 
care, in order to assess whether the care provided meets the needs of the individual 
patient.  
• Use the interpretive guidelines and other published CMS policy statements to guide the survey.   
• Use Appendix Q
 for guidance if Immediate Jeopardy is suspected.  
 General Procedures  
 Survey Locations 
 
For hospitals with either no or a small number of off-campus provider-based locations, survey all departments, services, and locations that bill for services under the hospital’s provider number and are considered part of the hospital.  For hospitals with many provider-based locations survey:  
• All hospital departments and services at the primary hospital campus and on the campuses of other remote locations of the hospital; 
 
• All satellite locations of the hospital; 
 • All inpatient care locations of the hospital; 
 • All out-patient surgery locations of the hospital; 
 • All locations where complex out-patient care is provided by the hospital; and 
 • Select a sample of each type of other services provided at additional provider-
based locations. 
 On any Medicare hospital survey, contracted patient care activities or patient services (such as dietary services, treatment services, diagnostic services, etc.) located on hospital campuses or hospital provider based locations should be surveyed as part of the hospital for compliance with the conditions of participation.  During the Survey  
 
• Observe what activities are taking place and assess the CoP that represent the scope 
and complexity of the patient care services located at each location, as well as, any 
other CoP that apply to those locations.  Expand the survey activities as necessary.  
 
• The SA and surveyors have discretion whether to allow, or to refuse to allow, facility personnel to accompany the surveyors during a survey.  Surveyors should make a decision whether to allow facility personnel to accompany them based on the circumstances at the time of the survey.   
• The team should meet at least daily in order to assess the status of the survey, progress of completion of assigned tasks, areas of concern, and to identify areas for additional investigations.  The team meetings should include an update by each surveyor t hat addresses findings and areas of concern that have been identified. If 
areas of concern are identified in the discussion, the team should coordinate efforts to obtain additional information. Additional team meetings can be called at any time during the survey to discuss crucial problems or issues.   
• All significant issues or significant adverse events must be brought to the team 
coordinator’s attention immediately.  
 
• Maintain open and ongoing dialogue with the facility staff throughout the survey 
process.  Conferences with facility staff may be held in order to inform them of survey findings.  This affords facility staff the opportunity to present additional informatio n or to offer explanations concerning identified issues.  Survey 
information must not be discussed unless the investigation process and data collection for the specific concerns is completed.  
 
• Surveyors should always maintain a professional working relationship with facility staff.  
 
• Surveyors need to respect patient privacy and maintain patient confidentiality at all times during the survey.  
 
• Surveyors should maintain their role as representatives of a regulatory agency.  Although non- consultative information may be provided upon request, the surveyor 
is not a consultant. 
 Patient Review  
 A comprehensive review of care and services received by each patient in the sample should be part of the hospital survey.  A comprehensive review includes observations of care/services provided to the patient, patient and/or family interview(s), staff inte rview(s), 
and medical record review.  After obtaining the patient’s permission, observe each sample patient receiving treatments (e.g., intravenous therapy, tube feedings, wound dressing changes) and observe the care provided in a variety of treatment sett ings, as necessary, to 
determine if patient needs are met.  
 Observations   Observations provide first -hand knowledge of hospital practice.  The regulations and 
interpretive guidelines offer guidance for conducting observations.  Observation of the care environment provides valuable information about how the care delivery system w orks and 
how hospital departments work together to provide care.  Surveyors are encouraged to make observations, complete interviews, and review records and policies/procedures by stationing themselves as physically close to patient care as possible.  Whil e completing a 
chart review, for instance, it may be possible to also observe the environment and the patients, as far as care being given, staff interactions with patients, safety hazards, and 
infection control practices.  When conducting observations, particular attention should be 
given to the following:  
 
• Patient care, including treatments and therapies in all patient care settings; 
 
• Staff member activities, equipment, documentation, building structure, sounds and smells;  
 
• People, care, activities, processes, documentation, policies, equipment, etc., that are present that should not be present, as well as, those that are not present that should be present;   
 
• Integration of all services, such that the facility is functioning as one integrated 
whole;  
 
• Whether quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) is a facility -
wide activity, incorporating every service and activity of the provider and whether 
every facility department and activity reports to, and receives reports from, the facility’s cen tral organized body managing the facility- wide QAPI program; and 
 
• Storage, security and confidentiality of medical records.  
 
A surveyor should take complete notes of all observations and should document: the date and time of the observation(s); location; patient identifiers, individuals present during the observation, and the activity being observed (e.g., therapy, treatment modality, etc).  
 A surveyor should have observations verified by the patient, family, facility staff, other 
survey team member(s), or by another mechanism. For example, when finding an out -dated 
medication in the pharmacy, ask the pharmacist to verify that the drug is out -dated.  In 
addition, a surveyor should integrate the data from observations with data gathered through interviews and document reviews.  
 Surveyors must not examine patients by themselves, although in certain circumstances, in order to determine a patient’s health status and whether appropriate health care is being provided, especially to ensure a patient’s welfare where he/she appears to be  in immediate 
jeopardy, it is permissible and necessary to examine the patient. After obtaining permission from the patient, the surveyor should request that a staff member of the facility examine the patient in the surveyor’s presence.  The health and dignity of the patient is always of paramount concern.  A surveyor must respect the patient’s right to refuse to be examined.  
 Interviews  
 Interviews provide a method to collect information, and to verify and validate information obtained through observations. Informal interviews should be conducted throughout the duration of the survey.  Use the information obtained from interviews to determ ine what 
additional observations, interviews, and record reviews are necessary.   When conducting interviews, observe the following:  
 
• Maintain detailed documentation of each interview conducted.  Document the interview date, time, and location; the full name and title of the person interviewed; and key points made and/or topics discussed.  To the extent possible, document quotes from the  interviewee.  
 
• Interviews with facility staff should be brief.  Use a few well- phrased questions 
to elicit the desired information.  For example, to determine if a staff member is aware of disaster procedures and his/her role in such events, simply ask, “If you 
smelled s moke, what would you do?”  
 
• When interviewing staff, begin your interviews with staff that work most closely 
with the patient.  
 
• Conduct patient interviews regarding their knowledge of their plan of care, the implementation of the plan, and the quality of the services received.  Other topics for patient or family interview may include patient rights, advanced directives, and the facility’s grievance/complaint procedure.  
 
• Interviews with patients must be conducted in privacy and with the patient’s prior permission.  
 
• Use open -ended questions during your interview.  
 
• Validate all information obtained.  
 
• Telephone interviews may be conducted if necessary, but a preference should be made for in - person interviews. 
 
• Integrate the data from interviews with data gathered through observations and document reviews.  
 Staff interviews should gather information about the staff’s knowledge of the patient’s needs, plan of care, and progress toward goals.  Problems or concerns identified during a patient or family interview should be addressed in the staff interview in orde r to validate the 
patient’s perception, or to gather additional information.   Patient interviews should include questions specific to the patient’s condition, reason for hospital admission, quality of care received, and the patients knowledge of their plan of care.  For instance, a surgical patient should be questioned about the process for preparation for surgery, the patient’s knowledge of and consent for the procedure, pre -operative patient 
teaching, post -operative patient goals and discharge plan.  
 Document Review  
 Document review focuses on a facility’s compliance with the CoP.  When conducting a document review, document the source and date of the information obtained.  When making document copies, identify the original date of the document and indicate the date and time the copies were made.  Once a document review is completed, integrate the data obtained with data gathered through observations and interviews to decide if the hospital is in compliance with the CoP.  Documents reviewed may be both written and elect ronic and 
include the following:   
• Patient’s clinical records, to validate information gained during the interviews, as 
well as for evidence of advanced directives, discharge planning instructions, and patient teaching.  This review will provide a broad picture of the patient’s care. Plans of care and discharge plans should be initiated immediately upon admission, and be modified as patient care needs change. The record review for that patient who has undergone surgery would include a review of the pre -surgical assessment, 
informed consent, operative report, and pre -, inter -, and post -operative anesthesia 
notes.  Although team members may have a specific area assigned during the survey, the team should avoid duplication of efforts during review of medical records and each surveyor should revi ew the record as a whole instead of targeting 
the assigned area of concern.  Surveyors should use open patient records rather than closed records, whenever possible;  
 
• Closed medical records may be used to determine past practice, and the scope or 
frequency of a deficient practice.  Closed records should also be reviewed to provide 
information about services that are not being provided by the hospital at the time of 
the survey.   For example, if there are no obstetrical patients in the facility at the time of the survey, review closed OB records to determine care practices, or to evaluate past activities that cannot be evaluated using open records. In the review of closed clinical records, review all selected medical records for an integrated plan of  
care, timelines of implementation of the plan of care, and the patient responses to the interventions.   
 
• Personnel files to determine if staff members have the appropriate educational requirements, have had the necessary training required, and are licensed, if it is required;  
 
• Credential files to determine if the facility complies with CMS requirements and State law, as well as, follows its own written policies for medical staff privileges and credentialing;  
 
• Maintenance records to determine if equipment is periodically examined and to determine if it is in good working order and if environmental requirements have been met;  
 
• Staffing documents to determine if adequate numbers of staff are provided according to the number and acuity of patients;  
 
• Policy and procedure manuals.  When reviewing policy and procedure manuals, 
verify with the person in charge of an area that the policy and procedure manuals are 
current; and  
 
• Contracts, if applicable, to determine if patient care, governing body, QAPI, and other CoP requirements are included.  
 Photocopies  
 
Surveyors should make photocopies of all documents needed to support survey findings.  The surveyor needs access to a photocopier where he/she can make their own photocopies of needed documents.  If requested by the hospital, the surveyor should make the hospital a copy of all items photocopied.  All photocopies need to be dated and timed as to when photocopied, and identified such as “hospital restraint policy-  2/17/04 page 3” or “Patient # 
6, progress note - 2/17/04.”  
 Completion of Hospital/CAH Medicare Database Worksheet  
 Arrange an interview with a member of the administrative staff to update and clarify information from the provider file.  The Hospital/CAH Medicare Database Worksheet will be used to collect information about the hospital’s services, locations, and staffing by Medicare surveyors during hospital surveys.  The worksheet will be completed by the surveyors using observation, staff interviews, and document review.  The worksheet will not be given to hospital staff to complete.  The worksheet is used to collect i nformation that 
will later be entered into the Medicare database.  During the interview clarify any inconsistencies from prior information or information gathered during the survey.  
 
Task 4 - Preliminary Decision Making and Analysis of Findings  
 General Objectives  
 The general objectives of this task are to integrate findings, review and analyze all 
information collected from observations, interviews, and record reviews, and to determine 
whether or not the hospital meets the Conditions of Participation found at 42 CFR Part 482 
and, as appropriate, the PPS exclusionary criteria at 42 CFR Part 412 Subpa rt B, and the 
swing -bed requirements at 42 CFR 482.66.  The team’s preliminary decision- making and 
analysis of findings assist it in preparing the exit conference report.  Based on the team’s decisions, additional activities may need to be initiated.  
 General Procedures  
 Preparation  
 Prior to beginning this Task, each team member should review his/her notes, worksheets, records, observations, interviews, and document reviews to assure that all investigations are complete and organized for presentation to the team.  Discussion Meeting  
 At this meeting, the surveyors will share their findings, evaluate the evidence, and make team decisions regarding compliance with each requirement.  Proceed sequentially through the requirements for each condition appropriate to the facility as they appea r in regulation.  
For any issues of noncompliance, the team needs to reach a consensus.  Decisions about deficiencies are to be team decisions, with each member having input. The team should document their decisions, the substance of the evidence, and the numbers of patients impacted, in order to identify the extent of facility noncompliance.  The team must ensure that their findings are supported by adequate documentation of observations, interviews and document reviews and includes any needed evidence suc h as photocopies.  Any additional 
documentation or evidence needed to support identified non compliance should be gathered prior to the exit conference but at a minimum, prior to exiting the hospital.  Determining the Severity of Deficiencies  
 
The regulations at 42 CFR 488.26 state, “The decision as to whether there is compliance with a particular requirement, condition of participation, or condition for coverage, depends upon the manner and degree to which the provider or supplier satisfies the  various standards 
within each condition.”  When noncompliance with a condition of participation is noted, the determination of whether a lack of compliance is at the Standard or Condition level depends upon the nature (how severe, how dangerous, how criti cal, etc.) and extent (how prevalent, 
how many, how pervasive, how often, etc.) of the lack of compliance.  The cited level of the noncompliance is determined by the interrelationship between the nature and extent of the noncompliance.  
 A deficiency at the Condition level may be due to noncompliance with requirements in a single standard or several standards within the condition, or with requirements of noncompliance with a single part (tag) representing a severe or critical health or saf ety 
breach.  Even a seemingly small breach in critical actions or at critical times can kill or severely injure a patient, and represents a critical or severe health or safety threat.  
 A deficiency is at the Standard level when there is noncompliance with any single requirement or several requirements within a particular standard that are not of such character as to substantially limit a facility’s capacity to furnish adequate care, or w hich 
would not jeopardize or adversely affect the health or safety of patients if the deficient 
practice recurred.  
When a deficient practice (noncompliance) is determined to have taken place prior to the 
survey and the hospital states that it has corrected the deficient practice/issue (noncompliance), issues for the survey team to consider would include:  
 
• Is the corrective action superficial or inadequate, or is the corrective action adequate 
and systemic?  
 
• Has the hospital implemented the corrective intervention(s) or action(s)?  
 • Has the hospital taken a QAPI approach to the corrective action to ensure 
monitoring, tracking and sustainability?  
 The survey team uses their judgment to determine if any action(s) taken by the hospital prior to the survey is sufficient to correct the noncompliance and to prevent the deficient practice from continuing or recurring.  If the deficient practice is correct ed prior to the 
survey, do not cite noncompliance.  However, if the noncompliance with any requirements is noted during the survey, even when the hospital corrects the noncompliance during the survey, cite noncompliance.  
 All noted noncompliance must be cited even when corrected on site during the survey.  Citing noncompliance at the appropriate level is important to the integrity of the survey process.  Citing too high a level is unfair to the hospital.  Citing noncompliance at a level below the noted degree and manner of the noncompliance does not ensure that the hospital will develop acceptable plans of correction and implement corrective actions, and does not depict accurately whether the care provided adversely affects the health and safety of patients; and continued deficient practices may lead to adverse patient outcomes such as injury or death.  
 Gathering Additional Information  
 If it is determined that the survey team needs additional information to determine facility 
compliance or noncompliance, the team coordinator should decide the best way to conduct the additional review.  
 
Task 5 - Exit Conference  
 General Objective  
 The general objective of this task is to inform the facility staff of the team’s preliminary findings.  Prior to the Exit Conference  
 
• The team coordinator is responsible for organization of the presentation of the exit. 
 
• The team determines who will present the findings.  
 
• If the team feels it may encounter a problem during the exit, they should contact 
their immediate supervisor.  
 
Discontinuation of an Exit Conference  
 It is CMS’ general policy to conduct an exit conference at the conclusion of each survey.  However, there are some situations that justify refusal to continue or to conduct an exit conference. For example:  
 
• If the provider is represented by counsel (all participants in the exit conference should identify themselves), surveyors may refuse to conduct the conference if the lawyer tries to turn it into an evidentiary hearing; or  
 
• Any time the provider creates an environment that is hostile, intimidating, or 
inconsistent with the informal and preliminary nature of an exit conference, 
surveyors may refuse to conduct or continue the conference.  Under such 
circumstances, it is suggested that the team coordinator stop the exit conference and call the State agency for further direction.  
 Recording the Exit Conference  
 If the facility wishes to audio tape the conference, it must provide two tapes and tape recorders, recording the meeting simultaneously. The surveyors should take one of the tapes at the conclusion of the conference.  Video taping is also permitted if it i s not disruptive to 
the conference, and a copy is provided at the conclusion of the conference.  It is at the sole discretion of the surveyor(s) to determine if video taping is permitted.   General Principles  
 The following general principles apply when conducting an exit conference:  
 
• The facility determines which hospital staff will attend the exit conference.   
• The identity of an individual patient or staff member must not be revealed in discussing survey results.  Identity includes not just the name of an individual patient or staff member, but also includes any reference by which identity might be deduced.  
 
• Because of the ongoing dialogue between surveyors and facility staff during the survey, there should be few instances in which the facility is unaware of surveyor concerns or has not had an opportunity to present additional information prior to the exit co nference.  
 
Exit Conference Sequence  The following discusses the sequence of events in conducting an exit conference.  
 Introductory Remarks:  
 
• Thank everyone for cooperation during the survey.  
• Introduce all team members, mentioning any that have concluded their portion of 
the survey and have left the facility.  
 
• Briefly mention the reason for the survey.  
 
• Explain that the exit conference is an informal meeting to discuss preliminary 
findings.  
• Indicate that official findings are presented in writing on the Form CMS -2567. 
 Ground Rules  
 
• Explain how the team will conduct the exit conference and any ground rules.    
• Ground rules may include waiting until the surveyor finishes discussing each deficiency before accepting comments from facility staff.  
 
• State that the provider will have an opportunity to present new information after the exit conference for consideration after the survey.  
 
Presentation of Findings  
 
• Avoid referring to data tag numbers.  
 
• Present the findings of noncompliance, explaining why the findings are a violation.  If the provider asks for the regulatory basis, provide it.  
• Refrain from making any general comments (e.g., “Overall the facility is very good”).  Stick to the facts.  Do not rank findings.  Treat requirements as equal as possible.    
• Do not identify unmet requirements as condition or standard level.  Avoid 
statements such as, “the condition was not met” or “the standard was not met.”  It is 
better to state “the requirement is not met.”   
• If immediate jeopardy was identified, explain the significance and the need for immediate correction.  Follow instructions in Appendix Q
. 
• Assure that all findings are discussed at the exit conference.  
 
Closure  
• Explain that a statement of deficiencies (Form CMS -2567) will be mailed within 10 
working days to the hospital.   
• Explain that the Form CMS-2567 is the document disclosed to the public about the facility’s deficiencies and what is being done to remedy them.  The Form CMS-2567 is made public no later than 90 calendar days following completion of the survey.  It documents specific deficiencies cited, the facility’s plans for correction and timeframes, and it provides an opportunity for the facility to refute survey findings and furnish documentation that requirements are met.  
• Inform the facility that a written plan of correction must be submitted to the survey agency within 10 calendar days following receipt of the written statement of deficiencies.  
 
• Explain the required characteristics of a plan of correction.  The characteristics include: 
 
Corrective action to be taken for each individual affected by the deficient practice, including any system changes that must be made; 
 
• The position of the person who will monitor the corrective action and the frequency of monitoring; 
 
• Dates each corrective action will be completed;  
 
• The administrator or appropriate individual must sign and date the Form CMS -2567 before returning it to the survey agency; and 
 
• The submitted plan of correction must meet the approval of the State agency, or in some cases the CMS Regional Office for it to be acceptable.  
 
• If the exit conference was audio or video taped, obtain a copy of the tape in its entirety before leaving the facility.  
 
All team members should leave the facility together immediately following the exit 
conference.  If the facility staff provides further information for review, the team 
coordinator should decide the best way to conduct the further review.  It is usually prudent for at least two individuals to remain.   
 
Task 6 – Post-Survey Activities  
 General Objective  
 The general objective of this task is to complete the survey and certification requirements, in accordance with the regulations found at 42 CFR Part 488
. 
 General Procedures  
 Each State agency and Federal Regional Office should follow directives in the State Operations Manual. The procedures include:  
• Timelines for completing each step of the process;  
• Responsibilities of the team coordinator and other team members to complete the Form CMS -2567, “Statement of Deficiencies,” following the “Principles of 
Documentation”;  
• Notification to the facility staff regarding survey results;  
• Additional survey activities based on the survey results (e.g., revisit, forwarding 
documents to the Regional Office for further action/direction); 
 
• Completion of “Hospital Restraint/Seclusion Death Reporting Worksheet,” as appropriate;  
• Compilation of documents for the provider file; 
 
• Signed Authorization by Deemed Provider/Supplier Selected for Accreditation Organization Validation Survey is forwarded to RO; and 
 
• Enter the information collected on the Hospital/CAH Medicare Database Worksheet 
into the Medicare database.  
 Plan of Correction  Regulations at 42 CFR 488.28(a)
 allow certification of providers with deficiencies at the 
Standard or Condition level “only if the facility has submitted an acceptable plan of Correction [POC] for achieving compliance within a reasonable period of time acceptable to the Secretary.”  Fai lure to submit a POC may result in termination of the provider 
agreement as authorized by 
42 CFR 488.28(a)  and §489.53(a)(1) .  After a POC is 
submitted, the surveying entity makes the determination of the appropriateness of the POC. 
 
Psychiatric Hospital Survey Module  
 Background  State survey agencies are given the responsibility for conducting surveys of psychiatric hospitals to determine compliance with the two special conditions of participation.  However, most are not staffed with the personnel with the psychiatric expertise ne cessary to 
conduct the surveys.  In light of this, CMS has contracted out this function  for many years, 
and a panel of contracted psychiatric consultants has conducted the majority of surveys of 
psychiatric hospitals. 
 
General Procedures  
 When conducting a validation survey or other full survey of a psychiatric hospital using the hospital A-tags located in Appendix A of the SOM, the SA is also expected to conduct a review of the two special conditions of participation for psychiatric hospit als if: 
 
• The State survey agency has the expertise (i.e., at a minimum a Masters prepared  psychiatric nurse or an RN with inpatient psychiatric nursing experience) to serve on the team.  The surveyors should conduct the survey of the two special conditions as outlined in Appendix AA
 of the State Operations Manual.  
 It is strongly recommended that when the State survey agency does not have the clinical expertise to conduct surveys of psychiatric hospitals, the SA should request, through its regional office, the assistance of the contracted psychiatric surveyors.  
 Regulatory Authority and Requirements for Psychiatric Hospitals  
 The following regulations describe the special requirements for psychiatric hospitals:  
• 42 CFR 482.60 -- Special provisions applying to psychiatric hospitals;  
• 42 CFR 482.61 -- Special medical record requirements for psychiatric hospitals; and  
 
• 42 CFR 482.62 -- Special staff requirements for psychiatric hospitals.  
 The focus of the survey is on the “outcome” experienced by the patient and how the provider implements the plan of care.  The survey process includes seven (7) tasks.  When these tasks are viewed in total, they give a clear indication of how the provider i s meeting 
or not meeting the requirements.  Appendix AA
 of the State Operations Manual (SOM) 
gives detailed instructions on how to perform these tasks.  The seven tasks are: 
 
• Representative sample of patients -- selection methodology; 
 
• Record review of individuals in the sample; 
 
• Other record review;  
 
• Direct patient observation;  
• Interviews;  
• Visit to each area of the hospital serving certified patients; and  
 
• Team assessment of compliance.  
 
Survey Preparation When Surveying the Two Special Conditions  
 When the SA is preparing to perform a survey of the special conditions while conducting a full survey (A-tags) of a psychiatric hospital, include in the preparation for the survey a review of Appendix A of the SOM, “Interpretive Guidelines and Survey Procedures for Hospitals,” and a review of Appendix AA
, “Interpretive Guidelines and Survey Procedures 
for Psychiatric Hospitals.” Appendix AA includes the following exhibits: 
 
• Exhibit 1, “Medicare/Medicaid Psychiatric Hospital Survey Data,” Form CMS -724 
(this form must be completed by the hospital and survey team.) 
 
• Exhibit 2, “Surveyor Worksheet for Psychiatric Hospital Review: Two Special 
Conditions,” Form CMS-725 (*optional)  
• Exhibit 3, “CMS Death Record Review Data Sheet,” Form CMS-726 (*optional)  
• Exhibit 4, “CMS Nursing Complement Data,” Form CMS-727 (*optional) 
 
• Exhibit 5, “CMS Total Nursing Staff Data,” Form CMS-728 (*optional) 
 
• Exhibit 6, “Data Collection Medical Staff Coverage,” Form CMS-729 (*optional) 
 *Although these forms are optional, they are useful for data collection purposes and will assist in determining the hospital’s compliance status.  
 Identify all remote and satellite locations of the psychiatric hospital.  
 Survey Methods  
 Follow the interpretive guidelines and survey protocol in Appendix AA
 to determine 
compliance with the two special conditions.  As judged appropriate by the survey team, patients selected for the survey of the two special conditions may be used to meet the patient selection requirements in the hospital survey protocol.  Surveyors should select patients using the sample selection methodology in Appendix AA of the psychiatric hospital survey protocol and, using the hospital survey protocol patient selection methods, should select any remaining or additional patients needed to determine the hospital’s compliance with the hospital CoP. 
 Identify any psychiatric hospital satellite(s), remote locations, or other provider based location(s).  Record the location, name, address, and telephone number for every satellite, remote location, or provider based location on the Hospital/CAH Medicare D atabase 
Worksheet for updating the Medicare database.  
 Post-Survey Activities  
 Follow the directions and procedures in the SOM for post-survey activities.  The findings for deficiencies noted for the A-tags and B-tags must be documented on separate Form CMS -2567. 
 
Psychiatric Unit Survey Module  
 When conducting a full survey of an accredited or non- accredited hospital that has a PPS 
excluded psychiatric unit, conduct a survey of the psychiatric unit using the survey methods in this module to assess the hospital’s compliance with the excluded psychiatric unit requirements.    Excluded unit surveys utilizing these methods will count as annual validation compliance surveys of the hospital’s self-attestation of compliance with the excluded psychiatric unit requirements.  
 Background  The PPS excluded psychiatric unit is part of the hospital and is included as part of the overall hospital survey.  The term “exclusion” is a reimbursement term.  Patient care in a 
PPS excluded psychiatric unit is reimbursed at the PPS psychiatric unit excluded rate rather 
than the hospital PPS rate.  In order for a hospital to receive the excluded rate for 
psychiatric care provided in its excluded unit, the unit must comply with the excluded psychiatric unit requirements found 
at 42 CFR 412.27 . 
 A PPS excluded psychiatric unit is regulated by both the hospital CoP at 42 CFR 482
 (also 
found in Appendix A of the SOM) and the PPS excluded psychiatric unit requirements at 42 
CFR 412.27.  The actual psychiatric unit requirements are based on the Special Conditions 
of Participation for Psychiatric Hospitals found in §§482.60, 482.61, and 482.62 . 
 Requirements for PPS Excluded Psychiatric Units  
 
• 42 CFR 482
 - Conditions of Participation for hospitals; 
• 42 CFR 412.25  - Excluded hospital units:  Common Requirements; and 
 
• 42 CFR 412.27  - Excluded psychiatric units:  Additional Requirements 
 Activities Conducted Prior to Psychiatric Unit Survey  
 
• Contact the RO to determine if the hospital has approval for a PPS excluded 
psychiatric unit. 
 
• Contact the RO to determine the unit’s cost-reporting period. 
 
• If possible, establish the location or locations of the psychiatric unit.  Determine if 
the unit has a satellite or satellites in other locations.  Determination or verification of this information may have to wait until the survey team is onsite.  
 
• Do not conduct the survey of the PPS excluded psychiatric unit requirements within 90 days of the end of the hospital’s cost reporting period. 
 
• Review the “Psychiatric Unit Criteria Worksheet,” Form CMS -437. 
 
Survey Tool  The “Psychiatric Unit Criteria Worksheet,” Form CMS -437. 
 Survey Procedures for Determining Compliance with the PPS Excluded Psychiatric Unit Requirements  
 
• The surveyor of the psychiatric unit requirements should be an RN. 
 
• Select 10 percent of the unit’s average daily census or a minimum of two patients for the patient sample.  
 
• The selected patients should be included in the patient sample used for the full hospital survey. 
 
• Hospital survey activities should be conducted concurrently with the survey of the 
PPS excluded psychiatric unit requirements. 
 
• Using the “Psychiatric Unit Criteria Worksheet,” Form CMS -437, verify whether  
the requirements have been met by checking the appropriate boxes marked “YES” 
and “NO.” Under the column “Explanatory Statement,” document specifics of the findings.  Additional findings can be documented in a narrative note that should be attached to the worksheet.  
 
• Select additional patients (open or closed records) as needed to determine 
compliance with the excluded psychiatric unit requirements. 
 
• If there are patients on the unit who were admitted the day before or on the day of the survey, verify that all applicable requirements have been completed or are already in place.  These patients are in addition to the number of patients needed to establi sh the minimum patient sample size.  
 
• If there are no patients on the unit at the time the survey is conducted, review closed patient records of unit patients treated within 6 months of the date of the survey. 
 
• Identify if the psychiatric unit has a satellite or satellites.  Record the location, name, 
address, and telephone number for every satellite on the Hospital/CAH Medicare 
Database Worksheet for updating the Medicare database.  
 Exit Conference  
 
• Inform the hospital of findings of noncompliance with the excluded psychiatric unit requirements.  
 
• Inform the hospital that the SA will forward the completed CMS Form-437 to the hospital at the same time as the completed CMS Form-2567. 
 Post-Survey Activities  
 
• Do not include the survey findings of the excluded psychiatric unit requirements on the Form CMS-2567 that is used to document the hospital survey findings. 
 
• If there are requirements that have not been met, notify the RO.  Document survey findings of PPS psychiatric unit requirements on the Form CMS-437.  Submit the completed Form CMS- 437 to the RO within the same time frame as the completion 
of the Form CMS-2567 and at least 60 days prior to the end of the hospital’s cost reporting period. 
 
• Follow the procedures in the SOM for post- survey activities.  
 
Rehabilitation Hospital Survey Module  
 
When conducting a full survey of an accredited or non- accredited rehabilitation hospital, 
conduct a survey of the hospital’s compliance with rehabilitation hospital excluded requirements using the survey methods in this module.  Surveys of the PPS excluded rehabilitation hospital requirements utilizing these methods 
will count as annual validation compliance surveys of the hospital’s self- attestation of 
compliance with the excluded requirements.  
 
Background  The term “exclusion” is a reimbursement term.  Patient care in a PPS excluded rehabilitation hospital is reimbursed at the PPS rehabilitation hospital excluded rate rather than at the hospital PPS rate.  In order for a hospital to receive the excluded rate for rehabilitation care provided, the hospital must comply with the excluded requirements found at 42 CFR 412
. 
 A PPS excluded rehabilitation hospital is regulated by both the hospital CoP at 42 CFR  482 
(also found in Appendix A of the SOM) and the PPS excluded rehabilitation hospital 
requirements at 42 CFR 412.

• Follow the requirements in the SOM for post- survey activities.  
 Hospital Swing -Bed Survey Module  
 When conducting a full survey of an accredited or unaccredited hospital that has swing-bed 
approval, conduct a survey of the hospital swing-bed requirements found at 42 CFR 482.66.  
These requirements, as well as interpretive guidelines, are found in Appendix T
 of the 
SOM.  An optional survey worksheet, also found in Appendix T, may be used. 
 Background  Swing -bed patients are hospital patients who are situated in the hospital but for whom the 
hospital is receiving reimbursement for skilled nursing services, as opposed to acute- care 
reimbursement.  The reference to swing -bed is a patient care and reimburse ment status and 
has no relationship to geographic location in the facility.  The patient may be in acute- care 
status one day and change to swing-bed status the next day.  It is not necessary for the patient to change location in the hospital when the reimbursement status changes, but moving to a different location is allowed.  A 3-day qualifying stay for the same spell of illness in any hospital or critical access hospital (CAH) is required prior to admission to swing -bed status.  The 3-day qualifying stay does not need to be from the same facility as 
the swing-bed admission.  Regulatory Authority and Requirements for Hospital Providers of Extended Care Services (“Swing -beds”)  
 Hospital swing -bed care is regulated by both the hospital requirements at 42 CFR Part 482 
(reprinted at Appendix A of the SOM) and the swing- bed requirements at 42 CFR 482.66
 
(also in Appendix T , along with an optional surveyor worksheet).  The actual swing-bed 
survey requirements are referenced in the Medicare Nursing Home requirements at 42 CFR Part 483. 
 Section 1883 of the Act authorizes payment under Medicare for post-hospital SNF services provided by any hospital that meets certain requirements.  By regulation, the Secretary has specified these requirements at 42 CFR 482.66: 
 
• The hospital has a Medicare provider agreement;  
 
• The facility has fewer than 100 hospital beds, excluding beds for newborns and beds 
in intensive care type inpatient units;  
 
• The hospital is located in a rural area.  This includes all areas not delineated as 
“urbanized” areas by the Census Bureau, based on the most recent census; 
 
• The hospital does not have in effect a 24-hour nursing waiver granted under 42 CFR 
§488.54(c);  
• The hospital has not had a swing-bed approval terminated within the two years previous to application; and  
• The hospital meets the swing -bed CoP on Resident Rights; Admission, Transfer, 
and Discharge Rights; Resident Behavior and Facility Practices; Patient Activities; Social Services; Discharge Planning; Specialized Rehabilitative Services; and Dental Services.  
 Activities Conducted Prior to Swing -Bed Survey  
 Prior to conducting the swing-bed survey, verify the following: 
 
• The hospital continues to be located in a rural census tract;  
• The hospital does not have a 24-hour nursing waiver in place; and  
• The hospital’s swing-bed approval is in effect and has not been terminated within the two previous years. 
 Survey Procedures  
 In conducting the survey, verify that the hospital has fewer than 100 hospital beds, excluding beds for newborns and beds in intensive care units.  A hospital licensed for more than 100 beds may be eligible for swing-bed approval if it utilizes and staffs for fewer than 100 beds.  Count the staffed beds in each nursing unit.  Do not count beds in recovery rooms, intensive care units, operating rooms, newborn nurseries or stretchers in emergency departments.  
 Assess the hospital’s compliance with the swing -bed requirements at 42 CFR 482.66, 
found in Appendix T
 of the SOM, and the hospital survey methods contained in the hospital 
survey protocol.  Swing-bed requirements apply to any patient discharged from the hospital and admitted to a swing-bed for skilled nursing services.  The requirements for acute- care 
hospitals also apply. 
 If swing -bed patients are present during the on-site inspection, conduct an open record 
review and an environmental assessment.  Include patient interviews and observations of care and services.  However, if no swing-bed patients are present during the on- site 
inspection, review two closed records for compliance with swing-bed requirements.  In all cases, review policies, procedures, and contracted services to assure that the hospital has the capability to provide the services needed.  It is important for surveyors to maintain on -going documentation of their findings during 
the course of the survey for later reference.  Surveyors may use the optional swing-bed worksheet as a note-taking tool to document and record their findings on the survey.  Exit Conference  
 
Any findings of noncompliance may be discussed during the time of the hospital exit conference.  
 
Post-Survey Activities  
 
The findings for swing- bed deficiencies must be documented on a separate Form CMS -
2567, even though the swing- bed survey is being conducted simultaneously with the 
hospital survey.

§482.1   Basis and scope.  
 
(a) Statutory basis. (1) Section 1861(e) of the [Social Security] Act provides that — 
 
(i) Hospitals participating in Medicare must meet certain specified requirements; and  
 (ii) The Secretary may impose additional requirements if they are found necessary in the interest of the health and safety of the individuals who are furnished services in hospitals.  
. . .  (b) Scope. Except as provided in subpart A of part 488 of this chapter, the provisions of this part serve as the basis of survey activities for the purpose 
of determining whether a 
hospital qualifies for a provider agreement under Medicare and Medicaid.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.1(a)(1)  
 Hospital Definition and Regulatory Enforcement Authorities  
 In order to qualify for a provider agreement as a hospital (other than a psychiatric hospital as defined at section 1861(f) of the Act) under Medicare and Medicaid , an entity must meet 
and continue to meet all of the statutory provisions of §1861(e) of the Act, including the Condition of Participation (CoP) requirements. See also 42 CFR 488.3(a)(1) and 42 CFR 489.12.   This means the entity must:  
 
• Be primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of physicians, to 
inpatients  (A) diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, 
treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or (B) rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons;  
 
• Maintain clinical records on all patients[addressed in 42 CFR 482.24, Medical 
Records];  
 
• Have medical staff bylaws [42 CFR 482.12, Governing Body, and 42 CFR 482.22, 
Medical Staff];  
 
• Have a requirement that every patient with respect to whom payment may be made 
under  Title XVIII must be under the care of a physician except that a patient receiving qualified psychologist services (as defined in section 1861(ii) of the Act) may be under the care of a clinical psychologist with respect to such services to the extent permitted under State law [42 CFR 482.12, Governing Body];  
• Provide 24-hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a registered professional nurse, and has a licensed practical nurse or registered professional nurse on duty at all times…[42 CFR 482.23, Nursing Services]; 
 
• Have in effect a hospital utilization review plan which meets the requirements of section 1861(k) of the Act [42 CFR 482.30, Utilization Review]; 
 
• Have in place a discharge planning process that meets the requirements of section 
1861(ee) of the Act [42 CFR 482.43, Discharge Planning]; 
 
• If located in a state in which state or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hospitals, be licensed under such law or be approved by the agency of the State or locality responsible for licensing hospitals as meeting the standards established for such licensing [42 CFR 482.11, Compliance with Federal, State, and Local Laws];  
• Have in effect an overall plan and budget that meets the requirements of section 1861(z) of the Act [42 CFR 482.12, Governing Body]; and   
• Meet any other requirements as the Secretary finds necessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services in the institution [42 CFR Parts 482 and 489, among others].  
Primarily Engaged  Generally, a hospital is primarily engaged in providing inpatient services under section 1861(e)(1) of the Act  when it is directly providing such services to inpatients. Having the capacity or potential capacity to provide inpatient care is not the equiva lent of actually 
providing such care.  Inpatient hospital services are defined under section 1861(b) of the Act and in the regulations at 42 CFR Part 409, Subpart B.  CMS guidance describes an inpatient as  
“a person who has been admitted to a hospital for bed occupancy for purposes of receiving inpatient hospital services …. Generally, a patient is considered an inpatient if formally admitted as an inpatient with the expectation that he or she will require hospital care that is expected to span at least two midnights  and occupy a bed even though it later 
develops that the patient can be discharged or transferred to another hospital and not actually use a hospital bed overnight.” (Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 1, §10, (
https://www.cms.gov/Regulations- and-
Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/bp102c01.pdf ) 
The “expectation of a two midnight stay” for an inpatient is that the intent of the physician was that the patient be admitted to the hospital for an inpatient stay as opposed to that of observation status which is an outpatient service.   Therefore, an average length of stay (ALOS) of two midnights would be one of the benchmarks considered for certification as a hospital.  
• In making a determination of whether or not a facility is primarily engaged in providing inpatient services and care to inpatients, CMS considers multiple factors and will make a final determination based on an evaluation of the facility in totality.  Such  factors include, but are not limited to, average daily census 
(ADC), average length of stay (ALOS), the number of off -campus outpatient 
locations, the number of provider based emergency departments, the number of 
inpatient beds related to the size of the facility and scope of services offered, volume of outpaient sur gical procedures compared to inpatient surgical 
procedures, staffing patterns, patterns of ADC by day of the week, etc.  Hospitals are not required to have a specific inpatient to outpatient ratio
 in order 
to meet the definition of primarily engaged.  
 
In order for surveyors to determine whether or not a hospital is in compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements of Medicare participation, including the definition of a hospital, they must observe the provision of care.  Medicare requirements  at 42 CFR 
488.26(c)(2) state that “The survey process uses resident and patient outcomes as the primary means to establish the compliance process of facilities and agencies. Specifically, surveyors will directly observe the actual provision of care and se rvices to resident s and/or 
patient s, and the effects of that care, to assess whether the care provided meets the needs of 
individual residents and/or patients.”  
 Because §488.26(c)(2) and section 1861(e) of the Act refer to patients (plural) hospitals must have at least two inpatients at the time of the survey in order for surveyors to conduct 
the survey.  However, just because a facility has two inpatients at the time of a survey does 
not necessarily mean that the facility is primarily engaged in inpatient care and satisfies all 
of the statutory requirements to be considered a hospital for Medicare purposes.  Having two patients at the time of a survey is merely a starting point in the overall survey and certification process.  
 If a hospital does not have at least two inpatients at the time of a survey, a survey will not be conducted at that time and an initial review of the facility’s admission data will be performed by surveyors while onsite to determine if the hospital has had an ADC of at least two and an ALOS of at least two midnights over the last 12 months.  Average daily census is calculated by adding the midnight daily census for each day of the 12 month period and then dividing the total number by the number of days in t he year.  For facilities that have 
multiple campuses operating under the same CMS Certification Number (CCN), the ADC is not calculated individually at each campus.  All locations make up the entire facility and 
the ADC will be based on the total inpatient census from all campuses.  This also includes 
PPS excluded psychiatric and rehabilitation units that are part of the facility.  
 
In order to be considered primarily engaged in providing inpatient services, prospective hospital providers and currently participating hospitals should  also be able to maintain an ALOS of two midnights or greater.  The ALOS is calculated by dividing the total number of inpatient hospital days (day of admission to day of discharge, including day of death) by the total number of discharges in the hospital over 12 months.  For facilities that have not been operating for 12 months at the time of the survey, a n ADC calculated using 12 months as 
the denominator may falsely result in an ADC of less than two.  Therefore, facilities that have been operating less than 12 months at the time of the survey, should calculate its ADC based on the number of months the fac ility has been operational but no less than three 
months.  This does not mean that a facility must be operational for at least three months before a survey can be completed.   It merely means that the ADC cannot be calculated 
using a denominator of less tha n three months. 
 
• If the ADC and ALOS is two or more, the State Survey Agency (SA) or Accrediting 
Organization (AO) makes the determination that a second survey will be attempted 
at a later date.  
 
• If the facility does not have a minimum ADC of two inpatients and an ALOS of two 
over the last 12 months (or less than 12 months for facilities that have not been 
operational for at least 12 months), the facility is most likely not primarily engaged in providing care to inpatients and the SA or AO may not conduct the survey.  The 
SA or AO must immediately contact the RO to inform them that a survey could not 
be completed and the CMS Regional Office will review additional information 
provided by the SA or AO to determine whether a second survey should be attempted.  
 
• When the ADC and ALOS are NOT a minimum of two, the SA or AO do not make the final determination whether a second survey will be attempted.  Instead, the SA or AO must obtain further information from the facility (other factors described below), review the  information and make a recommendation to the RO regarding 
whether a second survey should be attempted.  The SA or AO must provide its recommendation in writing to the RO along with the supporting information used to make the recommendation.  The RO must r eview the recommendation and 
information and make a determination on whether a second survey will be conducted and communicate its decision to the SA or AO within seven business days of receipt of the recommendation.  AO communication to the RO must be via  
the current established process used for all other written communication to the RO.  
• If during a second survey attempt, the facility does not have two inpatients, the survey will not be conducted and the SA or AO must cite condition level non-compliance with §482.1. In addition, the SA or AO must immediately notify the RO of the situation.  The RO will then proceed with either denial of certification (for initial applicants) in the Medicare program or termination of the provider agreement (for currently participating hospitals).  For currently participating hospitals, the RO will base any t ermination action on the totality of the situation including 
consideration of any access to care issues.  
 
Other factors that the CMS Regional Office should consider in determining whether to (1) conduct a second survey or (2) recommend denial of an initial applicant or termination of a current provider agreement, include but are not limited to:  
 
• The number of provider -based off -campus emergency departments (EDs).  An 
unusually large number of off -campus EDs may suggest that a facility is not 
primarily engaged in inpatient care and is instead primarily engaged in providing outpatient emergency serv ices. 
 
• The number of inpatient beds in relation to the size of the facility and services offered.  
 
• The volume of outpatient surgical procedures compared to inpatient surgical procedures.  
 
• If the facility considers itself to be a “surgical” hospital, are procedures mostly 
outpatient?  
 
• Does the information indicate that surgeries are routinely scheduled early in 
the week and does it appear this admission pattern results in all or most patients being discharged prior to the weekend (for example does the facility routinely operate in a manner that its designated “inpatient beds” are not in use on weekends)?  
 
• Patterns and trends in the ADC by the day of the week.  For example, does the ADC consistently drop to zero on Saturdays and Sundays?  Therefore suggesting that the facility is not consistently and primarily engaged in providing care to inpatients.  
• Staffing patterns.  A review of staffing schedules should demonstrate that nurses, 
pharmacists, physicians, etc. are scheduled to work to support 24/7 inpatient care 
versus staffing patterns for the support of outpatient operations. 
 
• How does the facility advertise itself to the community?  Is it advertised as a “specialty” hospital or “emergency” hospital?  Does the name of the facility include terms such as “clinic” or “center” as opposed to “hospital”? 
 
The CMS RO should consider all of the above factors (and other factors as necessary) to make a determination as to whether or not a facility is truly operating as a hospital for Medicare purposes. A determination of non- compliance with § 482.1 will not be based on a 
single factor, such as failing to have two inpatients at the time of a survey.  
 It is important to note that CMS has the final authority to make the determination of whether or not a facility has met the statutory definition of a hospital after considering the facility’s entire situation, the recommendations of the SA or AO surveyors as well as the 
evidence submitted by the SAs and AOs.  As stated previously, a facility that meets State requirements for obtaining State status as a hospital is not automatically considered a hospital for federal survey and certification purposes without further evaluation and consideration of all relevant CMS requirements.  In addition, approval by the Medicare administrative contractor of an enrollment application does not convey hospital status for CMS purposes.  Hospital status is only conveyed and approved by the CMS RO after a survey has been completed and the results clearly demonstrate that the facility has met all the federal requirements, including the statutory definition.  
 Survey Procedures §482.1(a)(1)  
 
• Verify there are at least two inpatients currently in the hospital at the time of survey  
 
• If yes, proceed with evaluating the whether the hospital is primarily engaged in providing the requisite services of a hospital, as well as in the Conditions of Participation.  
 
• If there are currently no inpatients in the hospital, no survey is to be conducted and surveyors should ask to see the following, in order to make the proper determination of the hospital’s status and to make the proper recommendations to the RO:  
 
o ADC over the last 12 months (or less for facilities operational for less than 12 months)  
 
 Look for patterns and trends in the ADC by the day of the week.  
 
o ALOS over the last 12 months (or less for facilities operational for less than 12 months)  
 
o The number of provider -based off -campus emergency departments.  
 
o The volume of outpatient surgical procedures compared to inpatient surgical procedures  
 
o Staffing schedules by day of week and shift over the last 12 months (or less 
for facilities operational for less than 12 months)  
 
o Verify the facility is providing the appropriate types and adequate numbers 
of staff to support 24/7 inpatient services (i.e. nursing, pharmacy, physicians, 
etc.) 
 
o Review the number of inpatient beds in relation to the size of the facility and 
services offered.  
  
o Determine if the number of inpatient beds could support emergency or 
unplanned admissions from the volumes of other services offered by the facility, such as ED patients or outpatient surgery patients?  
 
• If the initial review of the above information indicates that the facility is most likely not providing care to inpatients, then a second survey will not be conducted.  However, if the review of the information indicates the facility has had an ADC and ALOS of two over the last 12 months (or less for facilities operational for less than 12 months) and there are no other concerns regarding facility’s eligibility to be surveyed as a hospital, then a second survey will be scheduled for a future unannounced date after consulting with the RO.  
 
• Whenever the SA or AO is unable to complete a survey because the hospital did not have a sufficient number of inpatients that is a representative sample of the different types of services and patient populations that are treated at that hospital, it must immediately report this information to the RO.  
 
• Determine through interview, observation, and record review that the hospital meets the statutory requirements as defined by 1861(e), including the CoPs  Verify the facility does the following: 
 
• Maintains clinical records on all patients; 
 
• Has medical staff bylaws;  
 
• Has a requirement that every patient with respect to whom payment may be 
made under  this title must be under the care of a physician except that a patient receiving qualified psychologist services (as defined in section 1861(ii) of the Act) may be under t he care of a clinical psychologist with respect to such 
services to the extent permitted under State law;  
 
• Provides 24- hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a registered 
professional nurse, and has a licensed practical nurse or registered professional 
nurse on duty at all times…;  
 
• Has in effect a hospital utilization review plan which meets the requirements of section 1861(k) of the Act;  
 
• Has in place a discharge planning process that meets the requirements of section 1861(ee) of the Act;  
 
• If located in a state in which state or applicable local law provides for the 
licensing of hospitals, be licensed under such law or be approved by the agency of the State or locality responsible for licensing hospitals, as meeting the standards established  for such licensing;  
 
• Has in effect an overall plan and budget that meets the requirements of section 
1861(z) of the Act.

 Interpretive Guidelines §482.11(b)  
 Hospitals applying for initial Medicare certification as a hospital or hospitals currently participating in Medicare must, among other things, meet the statutory definition of a hospital under section 1861(e) of the Act. Section 1861(e)(7) of the Act  furt her requires 
that a hospital located in a state which provides for the licensing of hospitals, the hospital must be licensed in accordance with state law or approved as meeting standards for licensing as established by the agency of the State or locality r esponsible for the licensing 
of hospitals.  While a facility may have a license from a state to operate as a hospital or may have been approved by a state as a hospital under state or local standards and authorities, that facility may still not meet the Medicare definition of a hospital as per the A ct.  The criteria used by 
a state to determine that a hospital meets the requirements for state licensure as a hospital is not the same criteria used to define a hospital for the purpose of participation in Medicare, and each state has its own criteria and  standards for licensure.  
 The definition of a hospital and the issue of whether the facility is Primarily Engaged are 
issues not applicable to a Critical Access Hospital (CAH).  
 
Survey Procedures §482.11(b)  
 
• Prior to the survey, determine whether the hospital has a current license by the state or local authority in which it operates, or, if it is located within a  
State that does not license hospitals, verify that the responsible State agency has approved the hospital as meeting the State’s established standards for the licensing of hospitals.

§482.11(c)  The hospital must assure that personnel are licensed or meet 
other applicable standards that are required by State or local laws.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.11(c)  
 All staff that are required by the State to be licensed must possess a current license.  The hospital must assure that these personnel are in compliance with the State’s licensure laws.  The laws requiring licensure vary from state to state.  Examples of healthcare professionals that a state may require to be licensed could include:  nurses, MD/DOs, physician assistants, dieticians, x -ray technologists, dentists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, 
respiratory therapists and hospital administrator s. 
 All staff must meet all applicable standards required by State or local law for hospital personnel.  This would include at a minimum:  
 
• Certification requirements; 
 
• Minimum qualifications;  
 
• Training/education requirements; and  
 
• Permits (such as food handlers permits).  
 When telemedicine is used and the practitioner and patient are located in  different states, 
the practitioner providing the patient care service must be licensed and/or meet the other applicable standards that are required by State or local laws in both the state where the practitioner is located and the state where the patient is located.  
 Survey Procedures §482.11(c)  
 
• Verify for those personnel required to be licensed, certified, and/or permitted by the State, that the hospital has established, and follows procedures for determining that personnel are properly licensed, certified, and/or permitted. 
 
• Verify that staff and personnel are licensed, certified, and/or permitted in 
accordance with State and local requirements.  
 
• Verify that staff and personnel meet all standards (such as continuing education, 
basic qualifications, etc.) required by State and local laws or regulations.  Verify that the hospital has a mechanism established and enforced to ensure compliance.  
 
• Review a sample of personnel files to verify that licensure and/or other required credentials information is up to date.  Verify State licensure compliance of the direct 
care personnel as well as administrators and supervisory personnel.

§482.12 Condition of Participation:  Governing Body  
 
There must be an effective governing body that is legally responsible for the conduct of the hospital.  If a hospital does not have an organized governing body, the persons legally responsible for the conduct of the hospital must carry out the functions specified in this part that pertain to the governing body.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.12  
 The hospital must have a governing body which is effective in carrying out its responsibilities for the conduct of the hospital.  In the absence of an organized governing body, there must be written documentation that identifies the individual or individua ls that 
are legally responsible for the conduct of the hospital operations.  
 If the hospital is part of a healthcare system that includes several separately certified hospitals, each with its own Medicare provider agreement and CMS Certification Number, the governing body of the healthcare system has the option to act as the governing body of each separately certified hospital, unless doing so would conflict with State law.  A hospital system also has the option to form several governing bodies, each of which is responsible for several separately certified hospitals.  For example, a  health system operating hospitals 
in many States might choose to form regional sub- boards each responsible for the hospitals 
in its region, or a health system that has a mixture of types of hospitals may choose to form one sub- board responsible for its short -term acute care hospitals and another for its long 
term care hospitals.  
 When deciding whether or not to exercise the option to have a single governing body for 
multiple hospitals in the system, another factor for systems to consider might be Medicare payment requirements at §§412.22(e) -  (h) applicable to certain types of hospitals, i.e., non-
grandfathered  Hospitals -within -Hospitals and Hospital Satellites.  In such cases where the 
hospital system owns both the tenant and the host hospital, using a single governing body for both hospitals would jeopardize the payment status of  a hospital that is being paid by 
Medicare under a payment system excluded from the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS).  However, surveyors do not assess compliance with or enforce the Medicare payment regulations that govern Hospitals -within-Hospitals or Hospital Satellites.  
 The Medicare program offers hospital facilities considerable flexibility regarding how they choose to participate.  Based on the geographic and other institutional limitations set out in the “provider -based” regulation at §413.65, which addresses provider -based status for 
hospital facilities in multiple locations, hospital governing bodies make business decisions about how they want to participate in Medicare, and they indicate on their Medicare enrollment application the choices they have made.  It is not uncommon to find multiple hospital campuses with one owner located in the same geographic area enrolled in Medicare as one hospital.  It is also not uncommon to see a hospital system choosing to enroll its various facilities as separately certified hospita ls.  Various factors enter into consideration 
when the governing body of a system makes these decisions.  
For example, some governing bodies prefer to enroll various campuses as separate hospitals, out of a concern that problems at one hospital’s campus might jeopardize the Medicare participation of the other campuses if they were a multi -campus hospital cover ed 
under one Medicare provider agreement.  In other cases a governing body may see the benefits of integrating clinical services on multiple campuses into one integrated hospital.  
In still other cases, the deciding factor might be the implications for Med icare 
reimbursement of graduate medical education, the ease of adding satellite locations, etc.  
 
CMS defers to the governing bodies of hospitals to weigh the pertinent factors and permissible options, and to make business decisions in their best interest when applying to participate in Medicare.  CMS’s hospital certification decisions and issuance of a provider agreement and associated CCN follow from these business decisions by a hospital’s governing body.  But once the “hospital,” with whatever component parts, has been certified, that hospital must independently demonstrate its compliance with the C oPs, 
independent of any other facility.  (77 FR 29040, May 16, 2012)  
 If a hospital system has chosen to have a one body act as the governing body for multiple separately certified hospitals (i.e., a system governing body), this does not alter the fact that each hospital must independently demonstrate compliance with the CoP s.  Examples of 
what this means include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 
• Each separately certified hospital must be separately and independently assessed 
for its compliance with the CoPs, through either State Survey Agency or approved Medicare hospital accreditation program surveys.   There is no survey of a hospital “system,” since the Medicare provider agreement and its terms are 
specific to each certified hospital.  
 
• A system governing body may wish to adopt identical policies and procedures 
for many aspects of a hospital’s operations across all of its hospitals within the system.  It has the flexibility to do so, but the documentation of such policies and procedures m ust be clear that the governing body has chosen to apply them 
to specifically named hospitals. Also, each hospital must be able to present for 
inspection the system governing body policies and procedures that clearly apply to that hospital.  For example:  
 A document that says “XX Healthsystem has adopted the following policy” is not  
acceptable.  Instead, the document must be more specific, such as, “XX Healthsystem adopts the following policy and procedure for Hospital A, Hospital B, and Hospital C.”  Furthermore, the names of each hospital (Hospitals A, B, and C in this example) mus t correspond to the names used for their provider agreements.  For 
example, if Hospital C is one Medicare -certified hospital with two inpatient 
campuses, one called “East” and on e called “West,” it is not  acceptable for the 
policy document to state, “XX Healthsystem adopts the following policy and procedure for Hospital A, Hospital B, and Hospital East and Hospital West.”  It would be acceptable to state, “XX Healthsystem adopts the following policy and procedure for Hospital A, Hospital B, and Hospital C.”  
 It also is not acceptable for the policy document to state, “XX Healthsystem adopts the following policy and procedure for Hospital A, Hospital B, and Hospital East, but not Hospital West.”  Since “Hospitals” East and West refer to separate campuses of Hospital C, which participates in Medicare as one multi -campus hospital, it is not 
appropriate to refer to these separate campuses of C as “hospitals,” since the XX Healthsystem made a business decision to enroll them as parts of one multi -campus 
hospital in Medicare.   CMS recognizes that, depending on the particular policy topic, it may be acceptable to have policies that vary by type of unit/department within a hospital.  The system governing body could achieve this as follows:  “XX Healthsystem adopts the following policy and procedure requiring that a physician 
be on- site 24 hours per day, seven days per week on the inpatient campuses of 
Hospital A and Hospital B, but within Hospital C, only for the East inpatient campus.”  
 
• Likewise, the minutes of the governing body must be written in such a manner so that it is clear when the governing body has taken actions that apply to a 
specific certified hospital.  
 
• Departments of separately certified hospitals with one system governing body 
cannot be operationally integrated.  For example, if a system has chosen to operate three separately certified hospitals in relatively close proximity to each other rather than to have them certified as one multi -campus hospital, then each 
hospital must have its own nursing service.  It may not have one integrated nursing service with one Director of Nursing who manages one nursing staff for all three hospitals.  The system cannot maintain one integrated schedule that assigns nursing staff among the different hospitals.  The system also cannot move them back and forth between hospitals on an ad hoc, as needed basis, as if they were one hospital.  
 On the other hand, the policies and procedures the governing body has adopted for the nursing service in each hospital may be identical, so long as the services operate separately.  It is also permissible for the same individual to be the Director of Nursi ng 
for each hospital, provided that he or she is able to carry out all of the duties of the position in each hospital, such as managing each hospital's separate nursing staff.  It is also permissible for one nurse to work at multiple hospitals within the s ystem, in the 
same way that a nurse may work for multiple hospitals that do not share ownership, but 
the nurse must have separate work schedules for each hospital.  Such schedules cannot 
overlap.  
 
• Likewise, although the system may choose to operate a quality 
assessment/performance improvement (QAPI) program at the system level which standardizes indicators measured across system hospitals, each 
separately -certified hospital in the system must have a  QAPI program that is 
specific to that hospital.  This is required not only to demonstrate compliance, but also for the governing body to function effectively, since reviewing QAPI program results only at the system level would make it difficult for the governing body to identify and act upon problems that are localized to one hospital. 
 
For example, the system may choose to use the same quality indicators or the same methodology to track adverse events across all system hospitals.  But each certified hospital must have its own QAPI data with respect to these indicators and adverse events.   If a system is tracking readmission rates across all of its hospitals, it must be 
able to separate out the hospital -specific results for the governing body’s review and 
possible action. 
 The governing body must be functioning effectively and holds the ultimate responsibility for the hospital’s compliance not only with the specific standards of the governing body CoP, but also with all of the CoPs.  This is the case regardless of whether the regulatory text for a particular condition or standard within a condition specifically mentions responsibilities of the governing body.  Substantial, i.e., condition- level, non- compliance 
with one of the other hospital CoPs may be an indicator that the governing body is not functioning effectively.  However, it is not the policy of CMS that condition- level 
noncompliance with any other CoP automatically results in a condition- level citation of the 
governing body CoP.  Surveyors must consider whether the ma nner and degree of the other 
deficiencies provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the governing body is not functioning effectively.  
 Survey Procedures §482.12  
• Verify that the hospital has an organized governing body or has written documentation that identifies the individual or individuals that are responsible for the conduct of the hospital operations. 
 
• If the hospital is part of a hospital system which uses one governing body for 
several of the hospital’s separately certified within the system: 
 
• Review the governing body minutes to determine if it is clear which actions pertain 
to which hospitals. 
 
• Select for review several policy and procedure documents adopted by the system 
governing body to determine if it is clear that they apply to the hospital being surveyed.

 The governing body must determine, in accordance with State law, which categories of practitioners are eligible for appointment to the medical staff.  
 Physicians  
 The medical staff must, at a minimum, be composed of doctors of medicine or doctors of osteopathy.  In addition, the medical staff may include other types of practitioners included in the definition of a physician in Section 1861(r) of the Social Security Act:  
 
 
• Doctor of dental surgery or of dental medicine;  
 
• Doctor of podiatric medicine;  
 
• Doctor of optometry; and  
 
• a Chiropractor.  
 In all cases, the practitioner included in the definition of a physician must be legally authorized to practice within the State where the hospital is located and providing services within their authorized scope of practice.  In addition, in certain instances the Social Security Act and regulations attach further limitations as to the type of hospital services for which a practitioner may be considered to be a “physician.”  See 42 CFR 482.12(c)(1) for more detail on these limitations.  
 
The governing body has the flexibility, consistent with State law, to determine whether 
practitioners included in the definition of a physician other than a doctor of medicine or 
osteopathy are eligible for appointment to the medical staff.

CMS expects that all physician practitioners granted privileges are also appointed as 
members of the medical staff.  However, if State law limits the composition of the 
hospital’s medical staff to certain categories of practitioners, e.g., only MDs or DOs, 
there is nothing in the CoPs that prohibits hospitals and their medical staffs from 
establishing certain practice privileges for other categories of physician practitioners 
excluded from medical staff membership under State law, or from granting those 
privileges to individual practitioners in those categories, as long as such privileges are 
recommended by the medical staff, approved by the governing body, and in accordance 
with State law.  (79 FR 27114 - 27115, May 12, 2014)   
 
For physician practitioners granted privileges only, the hospital’s governing body and its medical staff must exercise oversight, such as through credentialing and competency review, of those other physician practitioners to whom it grants privileges, just as it would for those practitioners appointed to its medical staff.  
 Non-physician practitioners  
 Furthermore, the governing body has the authority, in accordance with State law, to grant medical staff privileges and membership to non-physician practitioners.   The corresponding regulation at 42 CFR 482.22(a) allows hospitals and their medical staffs to take advantage of the expertise and skills of all types of practitioners who practice at the hospital when making decisions concerning medical staff privileges and membership.  Granting medical staff privileges and membership to non-physician practitione rs is an 
option available to the governing body; it is not a requirement.

 Practitioners are described in Section 1842(b)(18)(C) of the Act as any of the following:  
• Physician assistant (as defined in Section 1861(aa)(5) of the Act); 
 
• Nurse practitioner (as defined in Section 1861(aa)(5) of the Act); 
 
• Clinical nurse specialist (as defined in Section 1861(aa)(5) of the Act); 
 
• Certified registered nurse anesthetist (as defined in Section 1861(bb)(2) of the 
Act);  
 
• Certified nurse -midwife (as defined in Section 1861(gg)(2) of the Act);  
 
• Clinical social worker (as defined in Section 1861(hh)(1) of the Act;  
 
• Clinical psychologist (as defined in 42 CFR 410.71 for purposes of Section 
1861(ii) of the Act);  
 
• Anesthesiologist’s  Assistant (as defined at §410.69); or  
 
• Registered dietician or nutrition professional. 
 
Other types of licensed healthcare professionals have a more limited scope of practice and usually are not eligible for hospital medical staff privileges, unless their permitted scope of practice in their State makes them more comparable to the above liste d types of non-
physician practitioners.   Some examples of types of such licensed healthcare professionals who might be eligible for medical staff privileges, depending on State law and medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations include, but are not limit ed to:  
 
• Physical Therapist  (as defined  at §410.60 and §484.4);  
• Occupational Therapist (as defined at §410.59 and §484.4); and  
• Speech Language Therapist (as defined at §410.62 and §484.4).  
 Furthermore, some States have established a scope of practice for certain licensed pharmacists who are permitted to provide patient care, services that make them more like the above types of non -physician practitioners, including the monitoring and assessi ng of 
patients and ordering medications and laboratory tests.  In such States, a hospital may grant medical staff privileges to such pharmacists and/or appoint them as members of the medical staff.  There is no standard term for such pharmacists, although they are sometimes referred to as “clinical pharmacists.”  
Practitioners may be granted active, courtesy, emergency, temporary, etc. membership or privileges in accordance with state law and as specified in the medical staff bylaws, rules, and regulations.

prohibited from requiring board certification when considering a MD/DO for medi cal staff 
membership, but only that such certification must not be the only factor that the hospital considers.  In addition to matters of board certification, a hospital must also consider other criteria such as training, character, competence and judgmen t.  After analysis of all of the 
criteria, if all criteria are met except for board certification, the hospital has the discretion to decide not to select that individual to the medical staff.

hospital to meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section 
with regard to  the distant –site hospital’s physicians and practitioners providing 
telemedicine services.  The governing body of the hospital whose patients are receiving 
the telemedicine services may, in accordance with §482.22(a)(3) of this part, grant privileges based on its medical staff recommendations that rely on information provided by the distant -site hospital.  
 §482.12(a)(9)  Ensure that when telemedicine services are furnished to the hospital’s patients through an agreement with a distant -site telemedicine entity, the  written 
agreement specifies that the distant -site telemedicine entity is a contractor of servi ces 
to the hospital and as such, in accordance with §482.12(e), furnishes the contracted 
services in a manner that permits the hospital to comply with all applicable conditions 
of participation for the contracted services, including, but not limited to, th e 
requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section with regard to the 
distant -site telemedicine entity’s physicians and practitioners providing telemedicine 
services.  The governing body of the hospital whose patients are receiving the telemedicine services may, in accordance with §482.22(a)(4) of this part, grant privileges to physicians and practitioners employed by the distant -site telemedicine 
entity  based on such hospital’s medical staff recommendations; such staff recommendations may  rely on information provided by the distant -site telemedicine 
entity.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.12(a)(8)&(a)(9)  
 “Telemedicine,” as the term is used in this regulation, means the provision of clinical services to patients by physicians and practitioners from a distance via electronic communications.  The distant -site telemedicine physician or practitioner provides clinical 
services to the hospital patient either simultaneously, as is often the case with teleICU services, for example, or non- simultaneously, as may be the case with many teleradiology 
services.  “Simultaneously” means that the clinical services (for exam ple, assessment of the 
patient with a clinical plan for treatment, including any medical orders needed) are provided 
to the patient in “real time” by the telemedicine physician or practitioner, similar to the actions of an on- site physician or practitioner .  “Non- simultaneously” means that, while the 
telemedicine physician or practitioner still provides clinical services to the patient upon a formal request from the patient’s attending physician, such services may involve after -the-
fact interpretation of di agnostic tests in order to provide an assessment of the patient’s 
condition and do not necessarily require the telemedicine practitioner to directly assess the patient in “real time.”  This would be similar to the services provided by an on- site 
radiologis t who interprets a patient’s x- ray or CT scan and then communicates his or her 
assessment to the patient’s attending physician who then bases his or her diagnosis and treatment plan on these findings.   (See 76 FR 25551- 25552, May 5, 2011)  
 A hospital may make arrangements through written agreements either with a distant -site 
Medicare- participating hospital or a distant -site telemedicine entity for the provision of 
telemedicine services to the hospital’s patients by physicians or practitioner s who have been 
granted privileges by the distant -site hospital or telemedicine entity.   For the purposes of 
this rule, a distant -site telemedicine entity is defined as an entity that -- (1) provides 
telemedicine services; (2) is not a Medicare- participating hospital; and (3) provides 
contracted services in a manner that enables a hospital using its services to meet all applicable CoPs, particularly those requirements related to the credentialing and privileging of practitioners providing telemedicine services to the patients of a hospital.  A distant -site 
telemedicine entity would include a distant -site hospital that does not participate in the 
Medicare program that is providing telemedicine services to a Medicare- participating 
hospital. (See 76 FR 25553, May 5, 2011)  
 If a hospital enters into an agreement for telemedicine services with a distant -site hospital 
or telemedicine entity, the agreement must be in writing.  Furthermore, the written agreement must specify, in the case of a:  
 
• Distant- site hospital, that it is the responsibility of the governing body of the 
distant -site hospital to satisfy the requirements of §§482.12(a)(1) through (a) (7) 
with respect to those physicians and practitioners at the distant -site hospital who 
furnis h telemedicine services under the agreement.  Since the distant -site hospital 
must also be a Medicare- participating hospital (see §482.22(a)(3)), it has an 
independent obligation to comply with these governing body requirements 
concerning medical staff mem bership and privileging.  Nevertheless, the written 
agreement between the hospital and the distant -site hospital must explicitly 
include a provision addressing the distant -site hospital’s obligation to comply with 
these provisions. 
 
• Distant- site telemedicine entity, that the written agreement specifies that they 
entity is a contractor providing telemedicine services to the hospital, and that, in 
accordance with the requirements governing services under arrangement at §482.12(e), the telemedicine entity furnishes the contracted telemedicine services in a manner that permits the hospital to comply with the Conditions of Participation, including, but not limited to, the governing body requirements of §§482.12(a)(1) through (a) (7) with respect to those physicians and practitioners at the distant -site telemedicine entity who furnish telemedicine services under the 
agreement.  
 There are additional requirements for the content of the written agreement, specified at §482.22(a)(3) and §482.22(a)(4) under the medical staff Condition of Participation, which are discussed in the interpretive guidelines for those regulations.  
 The hospital’s governing body must grant privileges to each telemedicine physician or 
practitioner providing services at the hospital under an agreement with a distant -site 
hospital or telemedicine entity before they may provide telemedicine services.  The  scope 
of the privileges in the hospital must reflect the provision of the services via a telecommunications system.  For example, a surgeon at a distant -site hospital may provide 
telemedicine consultation services at a hospital under agreement, but obviously would not be able to perform surgery by this means and must not have surgical privileges in the hospital as part of his/her telemedicine services privileges.  If the surgeon also periodically performed surgery on -site at the hospital, then he or she would have to have privileges to do 
so, granted in the traditional manner provided for at §482.12(a)(1) through §482.12(a)(7) and §482.22(a)(1) and §482.22(a)(2).  
 In granting privileges to telemedicine physicians and practitioners, the hospital’s governing body has the option of considering hospital medical staff recommendations that rely, in accordance with §482.22(a)(3) and §482.22(a)(4), upon the credentialing and privileging decisions of the distant -site hospital or telemedicine entity.  With respect to the decisions of 
a distant -site telemedicine entity, the regulation states that this streamlined privileging 
option is available to the hospital for physicians and practitioners “employed” by the distant -site telemedicine entity.  We are interpreting “employed” in this context to mean 
“utilized by” the distant -site telemedicine entity to provide telemedicine services to the 
hospital under an agreement.  Since it is  common for telemedicine entities to contract with, 
rather than employ, the physicians and practitioners it utilizes to provide telemedicine services, it would not be reasonable or consistent with the regulatory intent to interpret “employed” to mean that the physicians or practitioners are employees of the distant -site 
telemedicine entity.  
 When the hospital’s governing body exercises the option to grant privileges based on its medical staff recommendations that rely upon the privileging decisions of a distant -site 
telemedicine hospital or entity, it may, but is not required to, maintain a se parate file on 
each telemedicine physician and practitioner, or may instead have a file on all telemedicine physicians and practitioners providing  services at the hospital under each agreement with a 
distant -site hospital or telemedicine entity, indicating which telemedicine services 
privileges the hospital has granted to each physician and practitioner on the list.  
 
Relying upon the credentialing and privileging decisions of the distant -site hospital or 
telemedicine entity is an option available to the hospital’s governing body, not a requirement.  A governing body may, if it so chooses, require its medical staff to independently review the credentials of and make privileging recommendations for each 
telemedicine physician and practitioner in accordance with §482.22(a)(1) and §482.22(a)(2), rather than permit its medical staff to rely upon the privileging decisions of the distant -site hospital or telemedicine entity.  The agreement with the distant- site hospital 
or telemedicine entity may not require the hospital to rely upon the distant -site 
organization’s privileging decisions.  Survey Procedures §482.12(a)(8)&(a)(9)  
 
• Ask the hospital’s leadership whether it uses telemedicine services.  If yes:

(Rev. 122, Issued: 09- 26-14, Effective: 09 -26-14, Implementation: 09- 26-14) 
 [The governing body must:]  
 §482.12(a)(10)  Consult directly with the individual assigned the responsibility for the organization and conduct of the hospital’s medical staff, or his or her designee.  At a minimum, this direct consultation must occur periodically throughout the fiscal  or 
calendar year and include discussion of matters related to the quality of medical care provided to patients of the hospital.  For a multi -hospital system using a single 
governing body, the single multi -hospital system governing body must consult direct ly 
with the individual responsible for the organized medical staff (or his or her designee) of each hospital within its system in addition to the other requirements of this paragraph (a).  Interpretive Guidelines §482.12(a)(10)  
 In accordance with §482.22(b)(3), there must be an individual member of the hospital’s medical staff  who is assigned responsibility for the organization and conduct of the medical staff (for purposes of this guidance, the “leader” of the medical staff).   §482.12(a)(10) requires that the governing body consult with this individual, or with someone the leader of the medical staff has designated.   
 “Direct consultation” means that the governing body, or a subcommittee of the governing body, meets with the leader(s) of the medical staff(s), or his/her designee(s) either face -to-
face or via a telecommunications system permitting immediate, synchronous 
communication. (79 FR 27113, May 12, 2014)  
 
This regulation does not preclude a hospital from having a member of the medical staff serve as a member of the hospital’s governing body.  However, membership on the governing body by a medical staff member is not sufficient per se to satisfy the requirem ent 
for periodic consultation.   In such a situation the hospital meets the consultation requirement only if the medical staff member serving on the governing body is the leader of the medical staff, or his or her designee, and only if such membership incl udes meeting 
with the board periodically throughout the fiscal or calendar year and discussing matters related to the quality of medical care provided to patients of the hospital.  If there were a change in the medical staff leadership or his/her designee,  and the bylaws governing terms 
and conditions of governing body membership did not allow for substitution of the new leader of the medical staff (or his or her designee) on the governing body, then the governing body would be expected to engage in direct consultation with the new leader of the medical staff, or his or her designee.  
 It should be noted that if a hospital chooses to have the leader of the medical staff, or his or her designee, serve on the governing body, there is nothing in the regulation which prohibits the hospital from also including other medical staff members on t he governing 
body in addition to the leader of the medical staff, or his or her designee.  
 In the case of a multi -hospital system that has one single governing body, the governing 
body must consult with each separately certified hospital’s medical staff leader, or his/her designee.  The consultations do not have to be separate.  For example, the  system governing 
body could periodically have a meeting that includes the leader of the medical staff, or his/her designee, from each hospital within the system, so long as there is discussion of 
matters related to the quality of medical care provided to the patients of each hospital.  If the medical staff members at separately certified hospitals in a multi- hospital system and 
the hospital system’s governing body also have opted to have a unified medical staff (see guidance for §482.22(b)(4)) for some or all of the hospitals in the syst em, then the 
governing body must consult with the leader of the unified medical staff or his/her designee.  In this case, the leader of the unified medical staff, or the designee, as applicable, is expected to be aware of the concerns/views of members of t he medical staff practicing at 
each separately certified hospital using the unified medical staff.  
 It is up to the governing body as to whether the leader of the medical staff must make the designation in writing when he or she chooses to designate another individual for these periodic consultations, or whether the leader of the medical staff may make i nformal, ad 
hoc designations.  It is also up to the governing body as to whether it wishes to establish minimum advance notice of a designation from the leader of the medical staff to the governing body.   
 The requirement for the governing body to consult periodically throughout the year leaves some flexibility for the governing body to determine how often during the year its consultations with the leader of the medical staff or designee would occur, but it is expected that consultations occur at least twice during either a calendar or fiscal year.  (“Fiscal year” refers to the Medicare cost -reporting year for the hospital; in the case of a hospital system 
with multiple, separately certified hospitals that ha ve one single governing body and a 
unified medical staff, it is possible that individual hospitals have separate fiscal years.  In this case, it would be more practical for the governing body to use a calendar year basis for 
determining the frequency of consultation.)  
 
The governing body is expected to determine the number of consultations needed based on various factors specific to the hospital, or to each of the hospitals within a multi -hospital 
system.  These factors include, but are not limited to, the scope and complexity of hospital services offered, specific patient populations served by a hospital, and any issues of patient 
safety and quality of care that a hospital’s quality assessment and performance 
improvement program might periodically identify as needing the attention of the governing 
body in consultation with its medical staff.  The hospital must also provide evidence that the governing body is appropriately responsive to any periodic and/or urgent requests from the leader of the medical staff or designee for timely consultation on issues regarding the quality of medical care provided to patients of the hospital.  (79 F R 27112, May 12, 2014).  
 The “year” referenced in the regulation may be either the calendar year or the hospital’s fiscal year, as identified on its Medicare cost report.  It is up to the hospital which approach it will take, but it must document the approach selected and consiste ntly apply it.  For 
example, if a hospital chooses to use the calendar year, and had only one consultation during a calendar year, it could not then point out that it had had two meetings during the time period covered by its fiscal year.  
The required consultation must include discussion of matters related to the quality of medical care provided to the hospital’s patients, or, in the case of a hospital system with one single governing body and a unified medical staff, the quality of medical  care provided to 
each separately certified hospital’s patients.  
 The hospital’s governing body must adopt policies and procedures addressing how it implements the requirement for periodic, direct consultation with the leader of the medical staff, or the designee.  The hospital must have evidence that the required consul tations do 
take place, such as meeting agendas and lists of attendees, or minutes taken of the discussion, including who was present, etc., and that matters related to the quality of medical care provided to patients of the hospital were discussed.  
 Survey Procedures §482.12(a)(10)  
 
• Ask the hospital’s CEO how the hospital complies with the requirement for 
periodic consultations by the governing body with the leader of the hospital’s medical staff, or the leader’s designee.  Can the CEO provide evidence that such consultations have occ urred, e.g., meeting agendas and lists of attendees, 
meeting minutes, etc.  
 
• Ask the CEO whether the hospital tracks these consultations by the calendar year or its fiscal year; ask to see a copy of the policy that establishes this.  
• Is there evidence that the consultations were “direct?”  
 
• Is there evidence that the governing body met with the medical staff leader 
or designee at least twice during the previous year?  
 
• Is there evidence that the discussion concerned matters related to the quality of medical care in the hospital?  
 
• Ask the leader of the hospital’s medical staff, or his/her designee, whether he or 
she has had meetings with either the whole governing body or a subcommittee 
of it to discuss the quality of medical care in the hospital.  
 
• Has the leader/designee ever requested a meeting in addition to those 
regularly scheduled, to discuss a matter of urgent concern to the medical staff?  If yes, did the governing body respond by setting up a meeting?  
 
If the hospital shares a unified medical staff with other separately certified hospitals in a multi- hospital system, the interview with the leader of the medical staff, or designee, may 
have to be conducted by telephone.  Ask the leader/designee how he/she  gathers 
information about the concerns/views of members of the medical staff practicing at the 
hospital being surveyed about the quality of medical care provided at that hospital.

A-0064 
(Rev. 37, Issued:  10- 17-08; Effective/Implementation Date:  10 -17-08) 
 
[…the governing body must ensure that the following requirements are met:]  
 
§482.12(c)(1)  Every Medicare patient is under the care of:  
 
(i)  A doctor of medicine or osteopathy.  (This provision is not to be 
construed to limit the authority of a doctor of medicine or osteopathy to 
delegate tasks to other qualified health care personnel to the extent recognized under State law or a State’s r egulatory mechanism.);  
 (ii) A doctor of dental surgery or dental medicine who is legally authorized 
to practice dentistry by the State and who is acting within the scope of his or her license;  
 (iii)A doctor of podiatric medicine, but only with respect to functions which he 
or she is legally authorized by the State to perform;  
 
(iv)  A doctor of optometry who is legally authorized to practice optometry 
by the State in which he or she practices;  
 
(v)  A chiropractor who is licensed by the State or legally authorized to 
perform the services of a chiropractor, but only with respect to treatment by 
means of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation demonstrated by x -ray to exist; and  
 (vi)  A clinical psychologist as defined in §410.71 of this chapter, but only 
with respect to clinical psychologist services as defined in §410.71 of this chapter and only to the extent permitted by State law.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.12(c)(1)  
 Practitioners other than doctors of medicine or osteopathy may join the medical staff if the practitioners are appropriately licensed and medical staff membership is in accordance with State law.  
 Every Medicare or Medicaid patient must be under the care of a licensed practitioner as defined in this requirement.  Survey Procedures §482.12(c)(1)  
 Verify that Medicare patients are under the care of a licensed practitioner as defined by (c)(1).

§482.12(c)(2)  ( continued)  
 If a Medicare patient is admitted by a practitioner not specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that patient is under the care of a doctor of medicine or osteopathy. 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.12(c)(2)  
 CMS hospital regulations do permit licensed practitioners (e.g., nurse practitioners, 
midwives, etc), as allowed by the State, to admit patients to a hospital, and CMS does not 
require these practitioners be employed by a MD/DO.  However, CMS regulations do 
require that Medicare and Medicaid patients admitted by these practitioners be under  the 
care of an MD/DO.   Evidence of being under the care of an MD/DO must be in the patient’s medical record.  If a hospital allows these practitioners to admit and care for patients, as allowed by State law, the governing body and medical staff would have to establish policies and bylaws to ensure that the requirements of 42 CFR §482 are met. 
 Midwife Patients  
 42 CFR 482.1(a)(5)
 states, "Section 1905(a) of the Act provides that 'medical assistance' 
(Medicaid) payments may be applied to various hospital services. Regulations interpreting those provisions specify that hospitals receiving payment under Medicaid must meet the require ments for participation in Medicare (except in the case of medical supervision of 
nurse midwife services. See §§440.10 and 440.165 of this chapter)." 
 Midwives are not specified at 42 CFR §482.12(c)(1).
 
 Section 482.1(a)(5), when taken together with this requirement ( 42 CFR 482.12(c)(2))
 
means that in a State that permits midwives to admit patients (and in accordance with hospital policy and practitioner privileges), CMS requires ONLY Medicare patients of a midwife be under the care of a doctor of medicine or osteopathy.  CMS DOES NOT require Medicaid or other non- Medicare patients admitted by a midwife to be under the care of a 
doctor of medicine or osteopathy.  
 Survey Procedures §482.12(c)(2)  If the hospital grants admitting privileges to these practitioners, select Medicare and Medicaid patients (select only Medicare patients for midwives) that are admitted to the hospital by these practitioners.  Determine if the patient is/was under the care  of an 
MD/DO.

 Survey Procedures §482.12(c)(3)  
• Verify the governing body has established and monitors the enforcement of policies that ensure a doctor of medicine or osteopathy is on duty or on call at all times to provide medical care and onsite supervision when necessary. 
 
• Review the “call” register and documents that assure that a doctor of medicine or osteopathy is on duty or on call at all times.   
 
• Interview nursing staff.  How do they know who is on call?  Are they able to call the on-call MD/DO and speak with him/her at all times?  When appropriate, do on -call 
MD/DOs come to the hospital to provide needed care.

(A)  Defined by the medical staff;  
 (B)  Permitted by State law; and  
 (C)  Limited, under paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, with respect to

 Interpretive Guidelines §482.12(c)(4)  
 CMS hospital regulations do permit licensed practitioners (i.e., doctors of dental surgery, dental medicine, podiatric medicine, or optometry; chiropractors; or clinical psychologists), as allowed by the State, to admit patients to a hospital.  However, CM S does require that 
Medicare and Medicaid patients who are admitted by a doctor of dental surgery, dental medicine, podiatric medicine, or optometry; a chiropractor; or clinical psychologist be under the care of a MD/DO with respect to any medical or psychiatric problem that is present on admission or develops during hospitalization that is outside the scope of practice of the admitting practitioner.  If a hospital allows a doctor of dental surgery, dental 
medicine, podiatric medicine, or optometry, a chiropractor or a clinical psychologist to admit and care for patients, as allowed by State law, the governing body and medical staff must establish policies and bylaws to ensure that the requirements of 42 CFR §482 are met.  As applicable, the patient’s medical record must demonstrate MD/DO responsibility/care.  
 Survey Procedures §482.12(c)(4)  
 
• Verify that an assigned doctor of medicine or osteopathy is responsible for and is monitoring the care of each Medicare or Medicaid patient with respect to all medical or psychiatric problems during the hospitalization. 
 
• If non -MD/DOs admit patients, verify that every Medicare/Medicaid patient is being 
monitored by an MD/DO who is responsible for any medical or psychiatric problem outside the scope of practice of the admitting practitioners.

§482.12(f)(2) If emergency services are not provided at the hospital, the governing body must assure that the medical staff has written policies and procedures for appraisal of emergencies, initial treatment, and referral when appropriate.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.12(f)(2)  
This requirement applies hospital- wide (all on -campus and off-campus locations) to 
hospitals that do not provide emergency services. 
 Hospitals without emergency departments must have appropriate policies and procedures in place for addressing individuals’ emergency care needs 24 hours per day and 7 days per week, including the following:    
• Appraisal of Persons with Emergencies:   A hospital must have medical staff 
policies and procedures for conducting appraisals of persons with emergencies.  The policies and procedures must  ensure that:  
 
o As required by 42 CFR 482.23(b)
, an RN is immediately available, as needed, to 
provide bedside care to any patient and that,  
 o Among such RN(s) who are immediately available at all times, there must be an RN(s) who is/are qualified, through a combination of education, licensure, and training, to conduct an assessment that enables them to recognize the fact that a person has a need  for emergency care.  
 
The policies and procedures for appraisal should provide that the MD/DO (on- site 
or on-call) would directly provide appraisals of emergencies or provide medical direction of on-site staff conducting appraisals.   
 
• Initial Treatment :  A hospital must have medical staff policies and procedures for 
providing the initial treatment needed by persons with emergency conditions.  Among the RN(s) who must be available at all times in a hospital as required by 
42 
CFR 482.23(b) , there must be RN(s) who are qualified, through a combination of 
education, licensure, and training, to provide initial treatment to a person experiencing a medical emergency.  The on -site or on -call physician could provide 
initial treatment directly or p rovide medical oversight and direction to other staff.  
This requirement, taken together with other hospital regulatory requirements, suggests that a prudent hospital would evaluate the patient population the hospital routinely cares for in order to antici pate potential emergency care scenarios and 
develop the policies, procedures, and staffing that would enable it to provide safe and adequate initial treatment of an emergency.  
 
• Referral when Appropriate:   A hospital must have medical staff policies and 
procedures to address situations in which a person’s emergency needs may exceed the hospital’s capabilities.  The policies and procedures should be designed to enable hospital staff members who respond to e mergencies to:   (a) recognize when 
a person requires a referral or transfer, and (b) assure appropriate handling of the 
transfer.  This includes arrangement for appropriate transport of the patient.  Further, 
in accordance with the Discharge Planning CoP at 42 CFR 482.43(d) , the hospital 
must transfer patients to appropriate facilities, i.e., those with the appropriate capabilities to handle the patient’s condition.  The regulation also requires that necessary medical information be sent along with the patient being transferred.  This enables the receiving hospital to treat the medical emergency more efficiently.  
 
• Patient Transportation and Emergency Medical Services (EMS ) 
  A hospital may arrange transportation of the referred patient by several methods, 
including using the hospital’s own ambulance service, the receiving hospital’s ambulance service, a contracted ambulance service, or, in extraordinary circumstances, alerting  EMS via calling 9 -1-1.  There is no specific Medicare 
prohibition on a hospital with or without an emergency department calling 9-1-1 in order to obtain transport of a patient to another hospital.  Use of 9-1-1 to obtain transport does not, however, relieve the hospital of its obligation to arrange for the patient’s transfer to an appropriate facility and to provide the necessary medical information along with the patient. 
 
A hospital policy or practice that relies on calling 9 -1-1 in order for EMS to 
substitute  its emergency response capabilities for those the hospital is required to 
maintain, as described above, is not consistent with the Medicare CoPs.  For example, a hospital may not rely upon 9-1-1 to provide appraisal and initial treatment of medical emergencies that occur at the hospital.  Such policy or practice should be considered as condition -level non -compliance with the 
applicable CoP, 
42 CFR 482.55 or 42 CFR 482.12(f) .     
 Survey Procedures §482.12(f)(2)  
• Verify that the medical staff has adopted written policies and procedures for the management of medical emergencies.  
• Review emergency care policies and procedures.  Are they consistent with the expectations articulated above for appraisal, initial treatment, and referral?  Do they address emergency procedures for all on-campus and off-campus locations? 
 
• Interview hospital staff at various locations.  Can they state their duties and what they are to do if an individual seeks or needs emergency care at their location?

§482.12(f)(3) If emergency services are provided at the hospital but are not provided at one or more off- campus departments of the hospital, the governing body of the 
hospital must assure that the medical staff has written policies and procedures in effect with respect to the off- campus department(s) for appraisal of emergencies and 
referral when appropriate.  
Interpretive Guidelines §482.12(f)(3)  This requirement applies to any off-campus hospital department/location that does not qualify as a dedicated emergency department in accordance with 42 CFR 489.24(b)
 and is 
part of a hospital that provides emergency services.  Such departments/locations must have and must implement medical staff policies and procedures for the appraisal of emergencies and referral when appropriate.  
 
• Appraisal of Persons with Emergencies:   A hospital must have medical staff policies 
and procedures for conducting appraisals of persons with emergencies at off- campus 
departments/locations that are not dedicated emergency departments.  The policies and 
procedures must ensure that clinical pers onnel -- who are qualified, through a 
combination of education, licensure, and training, to conduct an assessment that enables them to recognize the fact that a person has a need for emergency care -- are  available 
during all hours of operation at the off-campus department/location.  
 
• Referral when Appropriate:   A hospital must have medical staff policies and 
procedures to address situations in which a person’s emergency needs may exceed the capabilities of the off -campus departments/locations that are not dedicated emergency 
departments.  The policies and procedures should be designed to enable staff members at such locations to:  (a) recognize when a person requires a referral or transfer, and (b) assure appropriate handling of the transfer.  This includes arrangement for appropriate transport of the patient along with the transfer of the patient’s medical information so that the receiving hospital may treat the medical emergency more efficiently.  
 
• Initial Treatment:  Although there is no specific regulatory requirement for such off-
campus departments or locations to provide initial treatment of emergencies, nevertheless they are expected to provide treatment and stabilization consistent with the complexity of services, the type and qualifications of clinical staff, and the resources available at that location.  This expectation is based on the requirements of the Outpatient Services CoP that hospital outpatient services meet the needs of the patients  
in accordance with acceptable standards of practice, outpatient services must be appropriately organized and integrated with inpatient services, and outpatient services must have appropriate professional and nonprofessional personnel available.  For examp le, an off-campus cardiac rehabilitation clinic would be expected to have the 
appropriate qualified staff, equipment (such as a crash cart), and policies and procedures in place to appropriately provide appraisal, initial interventions, and referral of a patient who experiences a cardiac emergency.  
 
• A hospital policy or practice that relies on calling 9-1-1 in order for EMS to substitute  
its emergency response capabilities for those the hospital is required to maintain at its off-campus departments/locations, as described above, is not consistent with the Medicare CoPs.  However, given the more limited emergency capabilities that may be present in some off-campus departments or locations, calling 9-1-1 to respond to an emergency might be appropriate.  
 See the hospital emergency services CoP ( 42 CFR 482.55
) for the emergency requirements 
for the hospital’s locations that provide emergency services. 
 Survey Procedures §482.12(f)(3)  
• Review emergency care policies and procedures.  Determine if they address emergency procedures for all off -campus locations.  
 
• Interview off-campus hospital department staff.  Can they state their duties and what 
they are to do if an individual seeks emergency care?

§482.13 Condition of Participation:  Patient's Rights  
 
A hospital must protect and promote each patient’s rights.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13  
 These requirements apply to all Medicare or Medicaid participating hospitals including short-term, acute care, surgical, specialty, psychiatric, rehabilitation, long-term, children's and cancer, whether or not they are accredited.  This rule does not apply to critical access hospitals.  (See Social Security Act (the Act) §1861(e).)  These requirements, as well as the other Conditions of Participation in 42 CFR 482
, apply 
to all parts and locations (outpatient services, provider- based entities, inpatient services) of 
the Medicare participating hospital.  
 Survey Procedures §482.13  Survey of the Patients’ Rights Condition of Participation (CoP) should be coordinated by one surveyor.  However, each surveyor, as he/she conducts his/her survey assignments, should assess the hospital’s compliance with the Patients’ Rights CoP.

§482.13(a) Standard:  Notice of Rights  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(a)  The hospital must ensure the notice of rights requirements are met.   
A-0117 
(Rev. 75, Issued: 12-02- 11, Effective: 12 -02-11, Implementation: 12-02-11) 
 §482.13(a)(1) A hospital must inform each patient, or when appropriate, the patient’s representative (as allowed under State law), of the patient’s rights, in advance of furnishing or discontinuing patient care whenever possible.   Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(a)(1)  The hospital must inform each patient, or when appropriate, the patient’s representative as allowed by State law, of the patient’s rights.  Whenever possible, this notice must be provided before providing or stopping care.  All patients, inpatient or outpa tient, must be 
informed of their rights as hospital patients.  The patient’s rights include all of those discussed in this condition, as well as any other rights for which notice is required under State or Federal law or regulations for hospital patients.  (See 42 CFR 482.11
.) The 
patient’s rights should be provided and explained in a language or manner that the patient (or the patient’s representative) can understand.  This is consistent with the guidance related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 issued by the  Department of Health and Human Services - “Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient Persons” (August 8, 2003, 68 FR 47311).  In accordance with §482.11, hospitals are expected to comply with Title VI and may use this guidance to assist it in ensuring patient’s rights information is provided in a language and manner that the patient understands.  Surveyors do not assess compliance with these requirements on limited English proficiency, but may refer concerns about possible noncompliance to the Office for Civil Rights in the applicable Department of Health and Human Services Regional Office.  
 
Hospitals are expected to take reasonable steps to determine the patient’s wishes concerning 
designation of a representative.  Unless prohibited by applicable State law:  
 
• When a patient who is not incapacitated has designated, either orally to hospital staff or 
in writing, another individual to be his/her representative, the hospital must provide the designated individual with the required notice of patients’ rights in addi tion to the 
patient.  The explicit designation of a representative takes precedence over any non-designated relationship and continues throughout the patient’s inpatient stay or outpatient visit, unless expressly withdrawn, either orally or in writing, by the patient.  
 
• In the case of a patient who is incapacitated, when an individual presents the hospital 
with an advance directive, medical power of attorney or similar document executed by the patient and designating an individual to make medical decisions for the patient when incapacitated, then the hospital must, when presented with the document, provide the required notice of its policies to the designated representative.  The explicit designation of a representative takes precedence over any non -designated relationship and continues 
throughout the patient’s inpatient stay or outpatient visit, unless the patient ceases to be incapacitated and expressly withdraws the designation, either orally or in writing. 
 
• When a patient is incapacitated or otherwise unable to communicate his or her wishes, 
there is no written advance directive on file or presented, and an individual asserts that he or she is the patient’s spouse, domestic partner (whether or not formally es tablished 
and including a same -sex domestic partner), parent (including someone who has stood 
in loco parentis for the patient who is a minor child), or other family member and thus is the patient’s representative, the hospital is expected to accept this assertion, without 
demanding supporting documentation, and provide the required notice to the individual, unless:  
 
• More than one individual claims to be the patient’s representative.  In such cases, it would be appropriate for the hospital to ask each individual for documentation supporting his/her claim to be the patient’s representative.  The hospital should make its determination of who is the patient’s representative based upon the hospital’s determination of who the patient would most want to make decisions on his/her behalf.  Examples of documentation a hospital might consider could include, but are not limited to , the following:  proof of a legally recognized marriage, 
domestic partnership, or civil union; proof of a joint household; proof of shared or co-mingled finances; and any other documentation the hospital considers evidence 
of a special relationship that i ndicates familiarity with the patient’s preferences 
concerning medical treatment;  
 
• Treating the individual as the patient’s representative without requesting supporting documentation would result in the hospital violating State law.  State laws, including State regulations, may specify a procedure for determining who may be considered to be the incapacitated patient’s representative, and may specify when documentation is or is not required; or  
 
• The hospital has reasonable cause to believe that the individual is falsely claiming to be the patient’s spouse, domestic partner, parent or other family member.  
 Hospitals are expected to adopt policies and procedures that facilitate expeditious and non-discriminatory resolution of disputes about whether an individual is the patient’s 
representative, given the critical role of the representative in exercising the p atient’s 
rights. 
 
A refusal by the hospital of an individual’s request to be treated as the patient’s representative, based on one of the above -specified familial relationships, must be 
documented in the patient’s medical record, along with the specific basis for the refusal.  
 
In addition, according to the regulation at 42 CFR 489.27(a),  (which cross references the 
regulation at 42 CFR 405.1205 ), each Medicare beneficiary who is an inpatient (or his/her 
representative) must be provided the standardized notice, “An Important Message from Medicare” (IM), within 2 days of admission.  Medicare beneficiaries who have not been admitted (e.g., patients in observation status or receiving other care on an outpatient basis) are not required to receive the IM.  The IM is a standardized, OMB -approved form and 
cannot be altered from its original format.  The IM is to be signed and dated by the patient to acknowledge receipt.  See 
Exhibit 16 for a copy of the IM.  Furthermore, 42 CFR 
405.1205(c)  requires that hospitals present a copy of the signed IM in advance of the 
patient’s discharge, but not more than two calendar days before the patient’s discharge.  In the case of short inpatient stays, however, where initial delivery of the IM is within 2 calendar days of the discharge, the second delivery of the IM is not required.  
 The hospital must establish and implement policies and procedures that effectively ensure that patients and/or their representatives have the information necessary to exercise their rights.  Survey Procedures §482.13(a)(1)  
• Determine the hospital’s policy for notifying all patients of their rights, both inpatient 
and outpatient; 
 
• Determine that the hospital’s policy provides for determining when a patient has a 
representative and who that representative is, consistent with this guidance and State law.   
  
• Determine that the information provided to the patients by the hospital complies with 
Federal and State law;  
 
• Review records and interview staff to examine how the hospital communicates 
information about their rights to diverse patients, including individuals who need assistive devices or translation services.  Does the hospital have alternative means, such as wri tten materials, signs, or interpreters (when necessary), to communicate patients’ 
rights? 
 
• Review records and interview staff and patients or patients’ representatives (as 
appropriate) to examine how the hospital determines whether the patient has a 
representative, who that representative is, and whether notice of patients’ rights is 
provided as required to patients’ representatives.  
 
• Ask patients to tell you what the hospital has told them about their rights; 
 • Does staff know what steps to take to inform a patient about their patients’ rights, 
including those patients’ with special communication needs?; and 
 
• Review a sample of inpatient medical records for Medicare beneficiaries, to determine 
whether the records contain a signed and dated IM provided within 2 days of the admission of the patient.  For patients whose discharge occurred more than 2 days after the initial IM notice was issued, determine whether the hospital provided another copy 
of the IM to the patient prior to discharge in a timely manner.

§482.13(a)(2) The hospital must establish a process for prompt resolution of patient 
grievances and must inform each patient whom to contact to file a grievance . 
 Interpretive guidelines §482.13(a)(2)  
 The patient should have reasonable expectations of care and services and the facility should address those expectations in a timely, reasonable, and consistent manner.  Although 482.13(a)(2)(ii) and (iii)
 address documentation of facility time frames for a response to a 
grievance, the expectation is that the facility will have a process to comply with a relatively minor request in a more timely manner than a written response.  For example, a change in bedding, housekeeping of a room, and serving preferred food and beverage may be made relatively quickly and would not usually be considered a "grievance" and therefore would not require a written response. 
 The hospital must inform the patient and/or the patient's representative of the internal grievance process, including whom to contact to file a grievance (complaint).  As part of its notification of patient rights, the hospital must provide the patient or the patient's representative a phone number and address for lodging a grievance with the State agency.  The hospital must inform the patient that he/she may lodge a grievance with the State agency (the State agency that has licensure survey responsibility for the hospital) directly, regardless of whether he/she has first used the hospital's grievance process.    A “patient grievance ” is a formal or informal written or verbal complaint that is made to 
the hospital by a patient, or the patient’s representative, regarding the patient's care (when the complaint is not resolved at the time of the complaint by staff present), abuse or negl ect, 
issues related to the hospital's compliance with the CMS Hospital Conditions of Participation (CoPs), or a Medicare beneficiary billing complaint related to rights and limitations provided by 42 CFR 489
. 
 
• "Staff present" includes any hospital staff present at the time of the complaint or who can quickly be at the patient's location (i.e., nursing, administration, nursing supervisors, patient advocates, etc.) to resolve the patient's complaint. 
 
• If a patient care complaint cannot be resolved at the time of the complaint by staff 
present, is postponed for later resolution, is referred to other staff for later resolution, requires investigation, and/or requires further actions for resolution, then the complaint is a grievance for the purposes of these requirements.  A complaint is considered resolved when the patient is satisfied with the actions taken on their behalf.  
 
• Billing issues are not usually considered grievances for the purposes of these requirements.  However, a Medicare beneficiary billing complaint related to rights and limitations provided by 42 CFR 489
 is considered a grievance.  
 
• A written complaint is always considered a grievance.  This includes written 
complaints from an inpatient, an outpatient, a released/discharged patient, or a patient’s representative regarding the patient care provided, abuse or neglect, or the hospital's compliance with CoPs.  For the purposes of this requirement, an email or fax is considered "written." 
 
• Information obtained from patient satisfaction surveys usually does not meet the 
definition of a grievance.  If an identified patient writes or attaches a written 
complaint on the survey and requests resolution, then the complaint meets the definition of a grievance.  If an identified patient writes or attaches a complaint to the survey but has not requested resolution, the hospital must treat this as a 
grievance if the hospital would usually treat such a complaint as a grievance.  
 
• Patient complaints that are considered grievances also include situations where a 
patient or a patient's representative telephones the hospital with a complaint regarding the patient’s care or with an allegation of abuse or neglect, or failure of the hospi tal to comply with one or more CoPs, or other CMS requirements.  Those 
post-hospital verbal communications regarding patient care that would routinely 
have been handled by staff present if the communication had occurred during the stay/visit are not requir ed to be defined as a grievance.  
 
• All verbal or written complaints regarding abuse, neglect, patient harm, or hospital compliance with CMS requirements are considered grievances for the purposes of these requirements.  
 
• Whenever the patient or the patient's representative requests that his or her complaint be handled as a formal complaint or grievance or when the patient requests a response from the hospital, the complaint is considered a grievance and all the requirement s apply. 
 
• Data collected regarding patient grievances, as well as other complaints that are not 
defined as grievances (as determined by the hospital), must be incorporated in the 
hospital's Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) Program. 
 
Survey Procedures §482.13(a)(2)  
 
• Review the hospital’s policies and procedures to assure that its grievance process 
encourages all personnel to alert appropriate staff concerning any patient grievance.  
Does the hospital adhere to its policy/procedure established for grievances?  
 
• Interview patients or the patient’s legal representative to determine if they know how to file a complaint (grievance) and who to contact if they have a complaint (grievance).  
 
• Is the hospital following its grievance policies and procedures?  
 
• Does the hospital’s process assure that grievances involving situations or practices that place the patient in immediate danger are resolved in a timely manner? 
 
• Does the patient or the patient’s representative know that he/she has the right to file a complaint with the State agency as well as or instead of utilizing the hospital’s grievance process?  
 
• Has the hospital provided the telephone number for the State agency to all patients/patient representatives?  
 
• Are beneficiaries aware of their right to seek review by the QIO for quality of care 
issues, coverage decisions, and to appeal a premature discharge?

The hospital’s governing body must approve and be responsible for the effective operation of the grievance process, and must review and resolve grievances, unless it delegates the responsibility in writing to a grievance committee.]  The grievance process  must 
include a mechanism for timely referral of patient concerns regarding quality of care or premature di scharge to the appropriate Utilization and Quality Control Quality 
Improvement Organization.   At a minimum:  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(a)(2)  
 Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) are CMS contractors charged with reviewing the appropriateness and quality of care rendered to Medicare beneficiaries in the hospital setting.  The QIOs are also tasked with reviewing utilization decisions.  Part of  this duty 
includes reviewing discontinuation of stay determinations based upon a beneficiary’s request.  The regulations state the functions of the QIOs in order to make Medicare beneficiaries aware of the fact that if they have a complaint regarding qual ity of care , 
disagree with a coverage decision , or they wish to appeal a premature discharge, they may 
contact the QIO to lodge a complaint.  The hospital is required to have procedures for 
referring Medicare beneficiary concerns to the QIOs; additionally, CMS expects 
coordination between the grievance process and existing grievance referral procedures so that beneficiary complaints are handled timely and referred to the QIO at the beneficiary’s 
request.  
 This regulation requires coordination between the hospital’s existing mechanisms for utilization review notice and referral to QIOs for Medicare beneficiary concerns (See 42 CFR Part 489.27)
.  This requirement does not mandate that the hospital automatically 
refer each Medicare beneficiary’s grievance to the QIO; however, the hospital must inform all beneficiaries of this right, and comply with his or her request if the beneficiary asks for QIO review.  
 Medicare patients have the right to appeal a premature discharge (see Interpretive Guidelines for 42 CFR 482.13(a)).  Pursuant to 42 CFR 412.42(c)(3),
 a hospital must 
provide a hospital-issued notice of non- coverage (HINN) to any fee- for-service beneficiary 
that expresses dissatisfaction with an impending hospital discharge.  Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations are required to provide enrollees with a notice of non-coverage, known as the Notice of Discharge and Medicare Appeal Rights (NODMAR), only when a beneficiary disagrees with the discharge decision or when the MA organization (or hospital, if the MA organization has delegated to it the authority to make the discharge decision) is not discharging the enrollee, but no longer intends to cover the inpatient stay. 
 Survey Procedures §482.13(a)(2)  
• Review patient discharge materials.  Is the hospital in compliance with 42 CFR §489.27? 
 
• Does the hospital grievance process include a mechanism for timely referral of

• Interview Medicare patients.  Are they aware of their right to appeal premature 
discharge?

[At a minimum:]  
 
§482.13(a)(2)(ii) The grievance process must specify time frames for review of the grievance and the provision of a response.  Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(a)(2)(ii)  The hospital must review, investigate, and resolve each patient’s grievance within a reasonable time frame.  For example, grievances about situations that endanger the patient, such as neglect or abuse, should be reviewed immediately, given the seriousness of the allegations and the potential for harm to the patient(s).  However, regardless of the nature of the grievance, the hospital should make sure that it is responding to the substance of each grievance while identifying, investigating, and resolving any deeper, systemic problems indicated by the grievance.  Document when a grievance is so complicated that it may require an extensive investigation.  We recognize that staff scheduling as well as fluctuations in the numbers and complexity of grievances can affect the timeframes for the resolution of a grievance and the provision of a written response.  On average, a time frame of 7 days for the provision of the response would be considered appropriate.  We do not require that every grievance be resolved during the specified timeframe although most should be resolved.  
42 CFR 
482.13(a)(2)(iii)  specifies information the hospital must include in their response.   
 If the grievance will not be resolved, or if the investigation is not or will not be completed within 7 days, the hospital should inform the patient or the patient's representative that the hospital is still working to resolve the grievance and that the hospital will follow -up with a 
written response within a stated number of days in accordance with the hospital's grievance policy.  The hospital must attempt to resolve all grievances as soon as possible.  Survey Procedures §482.13(a)(2)(ii)  What time frames are established to review and respond to patient grievances?

§482.13(a)(2)(iii) In its resolution of the grievance, the hospital must provide the 
patient with written notice of its decision that contains the name of the hospital 
contact person, the steps taken on behalf of the patient to investigate the grievance, the results of the grievance process, and the date of completion.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(a)(2)(iii)  
The written notice of the hospital’s determination regarding the grievance must be 
communicated to the patient or the patient’s representative in a language and manner the 
patient or the patient’s legal representative understands. 
 The hospital may use additional tools to resolve a grievance, such as meeting with the patient and his family.  The regulatory requirements for the grievance process are minimum standards, and do not inhibit the use of additional effective approaches in handling patient grievances.  However, in all cases the hospital must provide a written notice (response) to each patient’s grievance(s).  The written response must contain the elements listed in this requirement.  
 When a patient communicates a grievance to the hospital via email the hospital may provide its response via email pursuant to hospital policy.  (Some hospitals have policies against communicating to patients over email.)  If the patient requests a response  via email, 
the hospital may respond via email.  When the email response contains the information stated in this requirement, the email meets the requirement for a written response.  The hospital must maintain evidence of its compliance with these requirements.  
 A grievance is considered resolved when the patient is satisfied with the actions taken on their behalf.  
 There may be situations where the hospital has taken appropriate and reasonable actions on the patient's behalf in order to resolve the patient's grievance and the patient or the patient's representative remains unsatisfied with the hospital's actions.  In these situations, the hospital may consider the grievance closed for the purposes of these requirements.  The hospital must maintain documentation of its efforts and demonstrate compliance with CMS requirements.  
 
In its written response, the hospital is not required to include statements that could be used in a legal action against the hospital, but the hospital must provide adequate information to address each item stated in this requirement.  The hospital is not required to provide an exhaustive explanation of every action the hospital has taken to investigate the grievance, resolve the grievance, or other actions taken by the hospital.

 §482.13(b)(1) The patient  has  the  right to participate in the development and implementation of his or her plan of care.   
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(b)(1)  
 
This regulation requires the hospital to actively include the patient in the development, implementation and revision of his/her plan of care.  It requires the hospital to plan the patient’s care, with patient participation, to meet the patient’s psycholog ical and medical 
needs.  
 The patient’s (or patient’s representatives, as allowed by State law) right to participate in the development and implementation of his or her plan of care includes at a minimum, the right to: participate in the development and implementation of his/her inpatient  
treatment/care plan , outpatient treatment/care plan , participate in the development and 
implementation of his/her discharge plan , and participate in the development and 
implementation of his/her pain management plan.  Hospitals are expected to take reasonable steps to determine the patient’s wishes concerning designation of a representative to exercise the patient’s right to participate in the development and implementation of the patient’s plan of care.  Unless prohibi ted by 
applicable State law:  
 
• When a patient who is not incapacitated has designated, either orally to hospital staff 
or in writing, another individual to be his/her representative, the hospital must involve 
the designated representative in the development and implementation of the pat ient’s 
plan of care.  The explicit designation of a representative by the patient takes precedence over any non -designated  relationship and continues throughout the 
patient’s inpatient stay or outpatient visit, unless expressly withdrawn, either orally or  
in writing, by the patient. 
 
• In the case of a patient who is incapacitated, when an individual presents the hospital with an advance directive, medical power of attorney or similar document executed by the patient and designating an individual to make medical decisions for the patient  
when incapacitated, the hospital, when presented with the document, must involve the designated representative in the development and implementation of the patient’s plan of care.  The explicit designation of a representative takes precedence over any non -
designated relationship and continues throughout the patient’s inpatient stay or outpatient visit, unless the patient ceases to be incapacitated and expressly withdraws the designation, either orally or in writing. 
 
• When a patient is incapacitated or otherwise unable to communicate his or her wishes, there is no written advance directive on file or presented, and an individual asserts that he or she is the patient’s spouse, domestic partner (whether or not formally es tablished 
and including a same -sex domestic partner), parent (including someone who has stood 
in loco parentis for the patient who is a minor child) or other family member and thus is the patient’s representative, the hospital is expected to accept this as sertion, without 
demanding supporting documentation, and must involve the individual as the patient’s representative in the development and implementation of the patient’s plan of care, unless:  
 
• More than one individual claims to be the patient’s representative.  In such cases, it would be appropriate for the hospital to ask each individual for documentation supporting his/her claim to be the patient’s representative.  The hospital should make its determination of who is the patient’s representative based upon the hospital’s determination of who the patient would most want to make decisions on his/her behalf.  Examples of documentation a hospital might consider could include, but are not limited to , the following:  proof of a legally recognized marriage, 
domestic partnership, or civil union; proof of a joint household; proof of shared or co-mingled finances; and any other documentation the hospital considers evidence 
of a special relationship that i ndicates familiarity with the patient’s preferences 
concerning medical treatment;  
 
• Treating the individual as the patient’s representative without requesting supporting 
documentation would result in the hospital violating State law.  State laws, including State regulations, may specify a procedure for determining who may be considered to be the incapacitated patient’s representative, and may specify when documentation is or is not required; or  
 
• The hospital has reasonable cause to believe that the individual is falsely claiming to be the patient’s spouse, domestic partner, parent or other family member.  
 
Hospitals are expected to adopt policies and procedures that facilitate expeditious and non-discriminatory resolution of disputes about whether an individual is the patient’s 
representative, given the critical role of the representative in exercising the p atient’s 
rights. 
 
A refusal by the hospital of an individual’s request to be treated as the patient’s representative, based on one of the above -specified familial relationships, must be 
documented in the patient’s medical record, along with the specific basis for the refusa l. 
 Survey Procedures §482.13(b)(1)  
 
• Does the hospital have policies and procedures to involve the patient or the patient’s representative (as appropriate) in the development and implementation of his/her inpatient treatment/care plan, outpatient treatment/care plan, discharge plan, and pain management plan?  
 
• Review records and interview staff and patients, or patients’ representatives (as appropriate), to determine how the hospital involves the patient or the patient’s representative (as appropriate) in the development and implementation of his/her plan of car e? 
 
• Does the hospital’s policy provide for determining when a patient has a 
representative who may exercise the patient’s right to participate in developing and 
implementing his/her plan of care, and who that representative is, consistent with 
this guidance and State law?  
 
• Is there evidence that the patient or the patient’s representative was included or 
proactively involved in the development and implementation of the patient’s plan of care?  
 
• Were revisions in the plan of care explained to the patient and/or the patient’s representative (when appropriate)?

(Rev. 95, Issued: 12- 12-13, Effective: 06 -07-13, Implementation: 06- 07-13) 
 §482.13(b)(2) The patient or his or her representative (as allowed under State law) has the right to make informed decisions regarding his or her care.  The patient's rights include being informed of his or her health status, being involved in care planning and treatment, and being able to request or refuse treatment.  This right must not be construed as a mechanism to demand the provision of treatment or services deemed medically unnecessary or inappropriate.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(b)(2)  
 
The right to make informed decisions means that the patient or patient’s representative is 
given the information needed in order to make "informed" decisions regarding his/her care.  
 Patient’s Representative:  
 A patient may wish to delegate his/her right to make informed decisions to another person (as allowed under State law).  
 Hospitals are expected to take reasonable steps to determine the patient’s wishes concerning designation of a representative. Unless prohibited by applicable State law:  
 
• When a patient who is not incapacitated has designated, either orally to hospital staff or in writing, another individual to be his/her representative, the hospital must provide the designated individual with the information required to make an informed de cision about the patient’s care. The hospital must also seek the written 
consent of the patient’s representative when informed consent is required for a care decision. The explicit designation of a representative by the patient takes precedence over any non- designated relationship and continues throughout the patient’s 
inpatient stay or outpatient visit, unless expressly withdrawn, either orally or in 
writing, by the patient.  
 
• In the case of a patient who is incapacitated, when an individual presents the 
hospital with an advance directive, medical power of attorney or similar document executed by the patient and designating an individual to make medical decisions for the patient  when incapacitated, the hospital must, when presented with the 
document, provide the designated individual the information required to make informed decisions about the patient’s care. The hospital must also seek the consent of the designated individual w hen informed consent is required for a care decision. 
The explicit designation of a representative takes precedence over any non -
designated relationship and continues throughout the patient’s inpatient stay or outpatient visit, unless the patient ceases to  be incapacitated and expressly 
withdraws the designation, either orally or in writing.

someone who has stood in loco parentis for the patient who is a minor child), or other family member and thus is the patient’s representative, the hospital is expected to accept this assertion, without demanding supporting documentation, and provide the individual the information required to make informed decisions about the patient’s care. The hospital must also seek the consent of the individual when informed consent is required for a  care decision. Hospitals are expected to treat the

 A refusal by the hospital of an individual’s request to be treated as the patient’s representative, based on one of the above- specified familial relationships, must 
be documented in the patient’s medical record must, along with the specific basis for the r efusal.  
 
Informed Decisions  
 The right to make informed decisions regarding care presumes that the patient or the patient’s representative has been provided information about his/her health status, diagnosis, and prognosis. Furthermore, it includes the patient's or the patient’s repre sentative’s participation in the development of his/her plan of care, including 
providing consent to, or refusal of, medical or surgical interventions, and in planning for care after discharge from the hospital. The patient or the patient's representative should receive adequate information, provided in a manner that the patient or the patient's representative can understand, to assure that the patient or the patient’s representative can effectively exercise the right to make informed decisions.   Hospitals must establish processes to assure that each patient or the patient's representative is given information on the patient's health status, diagnosis, and prognosis.   Giving informed consent to a treatment or a surgical procedure is one type of informed decision that a patient or patient's representative may need to make regarding the patient's plan of care. Hospitals must utilize an informed consent process that assures patients or their representatives are given the information and disclosures needed to make an informed decision about whether to consent to a procedure, intervention, or type of care that requires consent. See the guidelines for 42 CFR 482.51(b)(2)
 pertaining to surgical services 
informed consent and the guidelines for 42 CFR 482.24(c)(2)(v)  pertaining to medical 
records for further detail.  
 Informed decisions related to care planning also extend to discharge planning for the patient's post- acute care. See the guidelines at 42 CFR 482.43(c)
 pertaining to discharge 
planning for discussion of pertinent requirements.  
 Hospitals must also establish policies and procedures that assure a patient's right to request or refuse treatment. Such policies should indicate how the patient's request will be addressed. However, hospitals are under no obligation to fulfill a patient's request for a treatment or service that the responsible practitioner has deemed medically unnecessary or even inappropriate.   Required Hospital Disclosures to Patients:  
 
Physician Ownership  
 
In addition, there are certain provisions of the Medicare provider agreement rules concerning disclosures that certain hospitals are required to make which are enforced under 42 CFR 482.13(b)(2)
:  
 
• 42 CFR 489.3  defines a “physician -owned hospital” as any participating hospital in 
which a physician or immediate family member of a physician (as defined in §411.351) 
has an ownership or investment interest in the hospital, except for those satisfying an exception found at 
§411.356(a) or (b) .   Surveyors are not required to make an 
independent determination regarding whether a hospital meets the Medicare definition of “physician-owned,” but they must ask whether the hospital is physician-owned.  
 
• 42 CFR 489.20(u)(1) requires that all physician-owned hospitals provide written notice 
to their patients at the beginning of each patient’s hospital inpatient stay or outpatient visit stating that the hospital is physician -owned, in order to assist the patient in making 
an informed decision about his or her care, in accordance with the requirements of §482.13(b)(2).  
 
• A planned inpatient stay or outpatient visit which is subject to the notice requirement begins with the provision of a package of information regarding scheduled preadmission testing and registration for a planned hospital admission for inpatient care or f or an outpatient service subject to notice.  An unplanned inpatient 
stay or outpatient visit subject to the notice requirement begins at the earliest point at which the patient presents to the hospital. 
 
• The notice must disclose, in a manner reasonably designed to be understood by all patients, that the hospital is physician -owned and that a list of owners or investors who 
are physicians or immediate family members of physicians is available upon request. If 
the patient (or someone on behalf of the patient) requests this list, the hospital must provide it at the time of the request.  
 
• However, the notice requirement does not apply to any physician-owned hospital 
that does not have at least one referring physician (as defined at §411.351) who has 
an ownership or investment interest in the hospital or who has an immediate family member wh o has an ownership or investment interest in the hospital. In such cases, 
the hospital must sign an attestation statement that it has no referring physician with an ownership or investment interest or whose immediate family member has an 
ownership or inves tment interest in the hospital. The hospital must maintain this 
attestation in its records.  
 
• 42 CFR 489.20(u)(2) provides that physician-owned hospitals must require each 
physician owner who is a member of the hospital’s medical staff to agree, as a condition 
of obtaining/retaining medical staff membership or admitting privileges, to disclose in writing to all patients they refer to the hospital their ownership or investment interest in 
that hospital or that of any immediate family member. The hospital must require that this disclosure be made at the time of the referral and the requirement should be reflected in the hospital’s policies and procedures governing privileges for physician owners.  
 
• The hospital may exempt from this disclosure requirement any physician owner who does not refer any patients to the hospital.  
 
• 42 CFR 489.12
 permits CMS to refuse to enter into a provider agreement with a 
physician-owned hospital applicant that does not have procedures in place to notify 
patients of physician ownership in the hospital as required under §489.20(u).  
 
• 42 CFR 489.53(c) permits CMS to terminate a provider agreement with a physician-
owned hospital if the hospital fails to comply with the requirements at §489.20(u). 
 MD/DO 24/7 On -Site Presence  
 42 CFR 489.20(w ) mandates that if  there is no doctor of medicine or osteopathy present in 
the hospital 24 hours per day, seven days per week, the hospital must provide written notice of this to all inpatients at the beginning of a planned or unplanned inpatient stay, and to outpatients for certain types of planned or unplanned outpatient visits.  The purpose of this requirement is to assist the patient in making an informed decision about his/her care, in accordance with 42 CFR 482.13(b)(2
).  Hospitals that have an MD/DO on-site 24/7 
(including residents who are MDs or DOs) do not need to issue any disclosure notice about emergency services capability . 
 
• The notice must be provided to all inpatients and to those outpatients who are under observation or who are having surgery or any other procedure using anesthesia.   
 
• The notice must be provided at the beginning of the planned or unplanned inpatient 
stay, or outpatient visit subject to notice. 
 
• A planned inpatient stay or outpatient visit which is subject to the notice 
requirement begins with the provision of a package of information regarding scheduled preadmission testing and registration for a planned hospital admission for inpatient care or for an outpatient service subject to notice.  An unplanned inpatient stay or outpatient visit which is subject to the notice requirement begins at the earliest point at which the patient presents to the hospital.  
 
• Individual notices are not required in the hospital’s dedicated emergency department (DED) (as that term is defined in 42 CFR 489.24(b)), but the DED must post a notice conspicuously, in a place or places likely to be noticed by all individuals entering the DED.  The posted notice must state that the hospital does not have a doctor of medicine or a doctor of osteopathy present in the hospital 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, and must indicate how the hospital will meet the medical needs of any patient with an emergency medical condition, as defined in 42 CFR 489.24(b
) [the EMTALA 
definition], at a time when there is no doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy present in the hospital.  If an emergency department patient is determined to require admission, then the individual notice requirements of 42 CFR 489.20(w) would apply to that patient.  
 
• Before admitting an inpatient or providing outpatient services requiring notice, the 
hospital must obtain a signed acknowledgement from the patient stating that he/she understands that a doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy may not be present at all times services are furnished to him/her.   
 
• In the event of an unplanned surgery or inpatient admission to treat an emergency medical condition, it may in some cases be necessary in the interest of the patient’s safety to proceed with treatment before the required notice can be given and acknowledgement can be obtained.  In such circumstances, the hospital must provide notice and obtain acknowledgement as soon as possible after the patient’s stay or visit begins. 
 
• For a hospital that participates in Medicare with multiple campuses providing inpatient 
services (e.g., a main provider campus and separate satellite, remote, and/or provider-based locations) under one CMS Certification Number, a separate determination is 
made for each campus or satellite location with inpatient services as to whether the 
disclosure notice is required.  For example, if a hospital has a main campus and a 
satellite location and a physician is present 24/7 on the main campus but not at the satellite location, the hospital is required to provide the disclosure notice only at the 
satellite location.  No notice is required for patients presenting to the main provider campus in this case.  In this same example, if the hospital also has a provider-based, off-campus ambulatory (i.e., same-day) surgery department, no notice is required at that 
off-campus surgery site, since the hospital’s main campus does have an MD/DO present 
24/7.  
 
• 42 CFR 489.53 (c) permits CMS to terminate a provider agreement with a hospital if the 
hospital fails to comply with the requirements at §489.20(w) when it does not have an 
MD or DO on -site 24/ 7. 
 Survey Procedures §482.13(b)(2)  
 
• Is there a hospital policy addressing the patient's or the patient’s representative (as 
appropriate) right to make informed decisions?  
 
• Does the hospital’s policy provide for determining when a patient has a representative who may exercise the patient’s right to make informed decisions, and who that representative is, consistent with this guidance and State law?  
 
• Is there a hospital policy addressing the patient's right to have information on his/her 
medical status, diagnosis, and prognosis? Does it articulate the hospital's process for assuring that patients have this information?  
 
• Is there a hospital policy addressing how the patient will be involved in his/her care 
planning and treatment?  
 
• Is there evidence that the hospital routinely complies with its policies?  Evidence would 
be obtained through review of medical records, interviewing current patients and/or 
interviewing hospital personnel to determine their understanding of the hospital's 
informed decision-making policies and how they are implemented.  Review of evidence 
would be designed to determine whether patients/patient representatives are provided adequate information about the patient's medical status, diagnosis, and prognosis, and then allowed to make informed decisions about their care planning and treatment.  
 Assessing Required Disclosures:  
 Physician Ownership  
 
• If the hospital indicates that it is physician -owned but is exempt under §489.20(v) from 
the disclosure requirement of §489.20(u)(2), ask to see the signed attestation that it does 
not have any referring physicians with an ownership/investment interest or whose immediate family member has an ownership/investment interest in the hospital. (As with any other on-the-spot correction of a deficiency during a survey, creation of an attestation at the time of a survey does not mean that there was no deficiency and  that 
the hospital would not be cited.) 
 
• If the hospital is physician-owned but not exempt from the physician ownership disclosure requirements: 
 
• Verify that appropriate policies and procedures are in place to assure that necessary written notices are provided to all patients at the beginning of an inpatient or outpatient stay.  
 
• Review the notice the hospital issues to each patient to verify that it discloses, in a 
manner reasonably designed to be understood by all patients, that the hospital meets the Federal definition of “physician- owned,” that a list of owners and investors who 
are physicians or immediate family members of physicians is available upon request, and that such a list is provided to the patient at the time the request is made by or on behalf of the patient.  
 
• Determine through staff interviews, observation, and a review of policies and 
procedures whether the hospital furnishes its list of physician owners and investors at the time a patient or patient’s representative requests it.  
 
• Determine through staff interviews and review of policies, procedures, and staff 
records whether a physician- owned hospital’s medical staff membership and 
admitting privileging requirements include a requirement that, as a condition of continued membership or admitting privileges, physician owners who refer patients to the hospital agree to provide written disclosure of their own or any immediate family member’s ownership or investment interest to all patients at the time of the referral to the hospital.  
 
MD/DO 24/7 On -Site Presence  
 
• Determine through interviews, observation, and medical record review whether an 
MD/DO is present in the hospital, at each campus or satellite location providing inpatient services 24 hours/day, seven days/week.    
• For each required location where an MD/DO is not present:  
 
• Verify that the appropriate policies and procedures are in place to assure written notices that an MD/DO is not present at all times are provided at the beginning of an inpatient stay or outpatient stay to all inpatients and to all outpatients receiving observation services, surgery or another procedure requiring anesthesia.  
 
• Verify that there is signed acknowledgment by patients of such disclosure, obtained 
by the hospital prior to the patient’s admission or before applicable outpatient services were provided.  
 
• Ask a sample of inpatients and affected outpatients whether they were provided 
notice about an MD/DO not being present at all times in the hospital. 
 
• Verify that the hospital’s emergency department has signage with the appropriate 
disclosure information.  
 
• Review the notice the hospital issues to verify that it indicates how the hospital will 
meet the medical needs of any patient who develops an emergency medical condition at a time when no physician is present at that hospital, including any remote location   or satellite.  
  
A-0132 
(Rev. 75, Issued: 12- 02-11, Effective: 12 -02-11, Implementation: 12- 02-11) 
 §482.13(b)(3) The patient has the right to formulate advance directives and to have hospital staff and practitioners who provide care in the hospital comply with these directives, in accordance with §489.100 of this part (Definition), §489.102 of this part  
(Requirements for providers), and §489.104 of this part (Effective dates). 
 
Interpretive Guidelines  §482.13(b)(3) 
 An advance directive is defined at §489.100 as “ a written instruction, such as a living will 
or durable power of attorney for health care, recognized under State law (whether statutory or as recognized by the courts of the State), relating to the provision of health care when the individual is incapacit ated.”   The patient (inpatient or outpatient) has the right to formulate 
advance directives, and to have hospital staff implement and comply with their advance directive.  The regulation at 42 CFR 489.102
 specifies the rights of a patient (as permitted 
by State law) to make medical care decisions, including the right to accept or refuse medical or surgical treatment and the right to formulate, at the individual’s option, advance directives.  
 In the advance directive, the patient may provide guidance as to his/her wishes concerning provision of care in certain situations; alternatively the patient may delegate decision-making authority to another individual, as permitted by State law. (In addition, the patient may use the advance directive to designate a “support person,” as that term is used in §482.13(h), for purposes of exercising the patient’s visitation rights.)  When a patient who is incapacitated has executed an advance directive designat ing a particular individual to 
make medical decisions for him/her when incapacitated, the hospital must, when presented with the document, provide the designated individual the information required to make informed decisions about the patient’s care.  (See also the requirements at §482.13(b)(2).)  The hospital must also seek the consent of the patient’s representative when informed consent is required for a care decision.  The explicit designation of a representative in the patient’s advance directive takes  precedence over any non-designated relationship and 
continues throughout the patient’s inpatient stay or, as applicable, outpatient visit, unless the patient ceases to be incapacitated and expressly withdraws the designation, either orally or in writing.  §489.102 also requires the hospital to:   
• Provide written notice of its policies regarding the implementation of patients’ rights to make decisions concerning medical care, such as the right to formulate advance directives.  If an individual is incapacitated or otherwise unable to communicate, the hospital may provide the advance directive information required under §489.102 to the individual’s “family or surrogate in the same manner that it issues other materials about policies and procedures to the family of the incapacitated individual or to a surrogate or other concerned persons in accordance with State law.”(§489.102(e))    The guidance concerning the regulation at § 482.13(a)(1)  governing notice to the patient or the 
patient’s representative of the patient’s rights applies to the required provision of notice concerning the hospital’s advance directive policies.  Although both inpatients and outpatients have the same rights under §482.13(a)(1), §489.102(b)(1) requires that notice of the hospital’s advance directive policy be provided at the time an individual is admitted as an inpatient.  However, in view of the broader notice requirements at 
§482.13(a)(1), the hospital should also provide the advance directive notice to outpatients (or their representatives) who are in the emergency department, who are in an observation status, or who are undergoing same-day surgery.  The notice should be presented at the ti me of registration.  Notice is not required for other outpatients, given 
that they are unlikely to become incapacitated.  
 
• The notice must include a clear and precise statement of limitation if the hospital cannot 
implement an advance directive on the basis of conscience.  At a minimum, a statement of limitation should:  
 
• Clarify any differences between institution -wide conscience objections and those 
that may be raised by individual physicians or other practitioners; 
 
• Identify the State legal authority permitting such an objection; and  
 
• Describe the range of medical conditions or procedures affected by the conscience 
objection. 
 
It should be noted that this provision allowing for certain conscience objections to implementing an advance directive is narrowly focused on the directive’s content related to medical conditions or procedures.  This provision would not allow a hospital or  individual physician or practitioner to refuse to honor those portions of 
an advance directive that designate an individual as the patient’s representative and/or support person, given that such designation does not concern a medical condition or procedur e. 
 
Issuance of the written notice of the hospital’s advance directive policies to the patient or the patient’s representative must be documented in the patient’s medical record.  
 
• Document in a prominent part of the patient’s medical record whether or not the patient has executed an advance directive;  
 
• Not condition the provision of care or otherwise discriminate against an individual based on whether or not the individual has executed an advance directive;  
 
• Ensure compliance with requirements of State law concerning advance directives and inform individuals that complaints concerning the advance directive requirements may be filed with the State survey and certification agency;  
 
• Provide for the education of staff concerning its policies and procedures on advance directives.  The right to formulate advance directives includes the right to formulate a psychiatric advance directive (as allowed by State law); and  
 
• Provide community education regarding advance directives and the hospital must document its efforts.  
 
A psychiatric advance directive is akin to a traditional advance directive for health care.  
This type of advance directive might be prepared by an individual who is concerned that at some time he or she may be subject to involuntary psychiatric commitment or treatment.  The psychiatric  advance directive may cover a range of subjects, and may name another 
person who is authorized to make decisions for the individual if he or she is determined to be legally incompetent to make his/her own choices.  It may also provide the patient’s instru ctions about hospitalization, alternatives to hospitalization, the use of medications, 
types of therapies, and the patient’s wishes concerning restraint or seclusion.  The patient may designate who should be notified upon his/her admission to the hospital, as well as who should not be permitted to visit him or her.  State laws regarding the use of psychiatric advance directives vary.  
 In accordance with State law, a psychiatric advance directive should be accorded the same respect and consideration that a traditional advance directive for health care is given.  Hospitals should carefully coordinate how the choices of a patient balance w ith the rights of 
other patients, staff, and individuals in the event that a dangerous situation arises.  However, even if State law has not explicitly spoken to the use of psychiatric advance directives, consideration should be given to them inasmuch as this regulation also supports the patient’s right to participate in the development and implementation of h is or her plan of 
care.  When the patient is, for whatever reason, unable to communicate his/her wishes, the preferences expressed in the psychiatric advance directive can give critical insight to the MD/DOs, nurses, and other staff as they develop a plan of care and treatment for the 
patient.  
 
Survey Procedures  §482.13(b)(3)  
 
• Review the hospital’s advance directive notice.  Does it advise inpatients or applicable outpatients, or their representatives, of the patient’s right to formulate an advance directive and to have hospital staff comply with the advance directive (in accordance with State law)?  Does it include a clear, precise and valid statement of limitation if the hospital cannot implement an advance directive on the basis of conscience?  
 
• Review the records of a sample of patients for evidence of hospital compliance with advance directive notice requirements.  Does every inpatient or applicable outpatient record contain documentation that notice of the hospital’s advance directives policy was provided at the time of admission or registration?  Is there documentation of 
whether or not each patient has an advance directive?  For those patients who have reported an advance directive, has a copy of the patient’s advance directive been placed in the medical record?   
 
• What mechanism does the hospital have in place to allow patients to formulate an 
advance directive or to update their current advance directive?  Is there evidence that 
the hospital is promoting and protecting each patient’s right to formulate an advance directive?  
 
• Determine to what extent the hospital complies, as permitted under State law, with patient advance directives that delegate decisions about the patient’s care to a designated individual. 
 
• Determine to what extent the hospital educates its staff regarding advance directives.  
 
• Interview staff to determine their knowledge of the advance directives of the patients 
in their care.  
 
• Determine to what extent the hospital provides education for the patient population 
(inpatient and outpatient) regarding one’s rights under State law to formulate advance directives.  
  
A-0133 
(Rev. 75, Issued: 12- 02-11, Effective: 12 -02-11, Implementation: 12- 02-11) 
 
§482.13(b)(4) -  The patient has the right to have a family member or representative of 
his or her choice and his or her own physician notified promptly of his or her admission to the hospital.  Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(b)(4)  
 Identifying Who Is to Be Notified  
 For every inpatient admission, the hospital must ask the patient whether the hospital should notify a family member or representative about the admission.  If the patient requests such notice and identifies the family member or representative to be notifie d, the hospital must 
provide such notice promptly to the designated individual.  The explicit designation of a family member or representative by the patient takes precedence over any non- designated 
relationship.  The hospital must also ask the patient whether the hospital should notify his/her own 
physician. In the case of scheduled admissions, the patient’s own physician likely is already 
aware of the admission.  However, if the patient requests notice to and identifies the 
physician, the hospital must provide such notice promptly to the designated physician, regardless of whether the admission was scheduled in advance or emergent. 
 When a patient is incapacitated or otherwise unable to communicate and to identify a family member or representative to be notified, the hospital must make reasonable efforts to identify and promptly notify a family member or patient’s representative.  If an individual who has accompanied the patient to the hospital, or who comes to or contacts the hospital after the patient has been admitted, asserts that he or she is the patient’s spouse, domestic partner (whether or not formally established and including a same- sex domestic partner), 
parent (including someone who has stood in loco parentis for the patient who is a minor child), or other family member, the hospital is expected to accept this assertion, without demanding supporting documentation, and provide this individual information about the patient’s admission, unless:  
 
• More than one individual claims to be the patient’s family member or representative.  In such cases it would not be inappropriate for the hospital to ask each individual for documentation supporting his/her claim to be the patient’s family member or repres entative.  The hospital should make its determination of 
who is the patient’s representative based upon the hospital’s determination of who the patient would most want to make decisions on his/her behalf.  Examples of documentation a hospital might conside r could include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  proof of a legally recognized marriage, domestic partnership, or civil union; proof of a joint household; proof of shared or co- mingled finances; and any 
other documentation the hospital considers evidence of a special relationship that indicates familiarity with the patient’s preferences concerning medical treatment ;  
 
• Treating the individual as the patient’s family member or representative without requesting supporting documentation would result in the hospital violating State law.  State laws, including State regulations, may specify a procedure for determining who may be considered to be the incapacitated patient’s family member or representative, and may specify when documentation is or is not required; or  
 
• The hospital has reasonable cause to believe that the individual is falsely claiming to be the patient’s spouse, domestic partner, parent or other family member.  
 
Hospitals are expected to adopt policies and procedures that facilitate expeditious and non-discriminatory resolution of disputes about whether an individual should be notified as the patient’s family member or representative, given the critical role of th e representative in 
exercising the patient’s rights.  Hospitals may also choose to provide notice to more than one family member.  
 When a patient is incapacitated and the hospital is able through reasonable efforts to identify the patient’s own physician – e.g., through information obtained from a family member, or from review of prior admissions or outpatient encounters, or through access to the patient’s records in a regional system of electronic patient medical records in which the hospital participates – the hospital must promptly notify the patient’s physician of the admission.  Prompt Notice  
 The hospital must provide the required notice promptly.  “Promptly” means as soon as possible after the physician’s or other qualified practitioner’s order to admit the patient has been given.  Notice may be given orally in person, by telephone, by e -mail or other 
electronic means, or by other methods that achieve prompt notification.  It is not acceptable for the hospital to send a letter by regular mail. 
 
Medical Record Documentation  
 
The hospital must document that the patient, unless incapacitated, was asked no later than the time of admission whether he or she wanted a family member/representative notified, the date, time and method of notification when the patient requested such, or  whether the 
patient declined to have notice provided.  If the patient was incapacitated at the time of admission, the medical record must indicate what steps were taken to identify and provide notice to a family member/representative and to the patient’s physician.  
 Survey Procedures §482.13(b)(4)  
 
• Determine if the hospital has policies that address notification of a patient’s family or 
representative and physician when the patient is admitted as an inpatient. 
 
• Ask the hospital who is responsible for providing the required notice.  Interview 
person(s) responsible for providing the notice to determine how they identify the persons to be notified and the means of notification.  What do they do in the case of an incapacitated person to identify a family member/representative and the patient’s 
physician?  
 
• Review a sample of inpatient medical records.  Do the medical records provide 
evidence that the patient was asked about notifying a family member/representative and his/her physician?  Is there a record of when and how notice was provided?  Was notice provided promptly?  Is there a record of the patient declining to have notice provided to a family member/representative and his/her physician?  Is there documentation of 
whether the patient was incapacitated at the time of admission, and if so, what steps were taken to identify a family member/representative and the patient’s physician?

§482.13(c) Standard:  Privacy and Safety  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(c)  
 The hospital must ensure the privacy and safety requirements are met.

(Rev. 95, Issued: 12- 12-13, Effective: 06 -07-13, Implementation: 06- 07-13) 
 
§482.13(c)(1)  - The patient has the right to personal privacy. 
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(c)(1)  
 The underlying principle of this requirement is the patient’s basic right to respect, dignity, and comfort while in the hospital.    Physical Privacy  “The right to personal privacy” includes at a minimum, that patients have physical privacy to the extent consistent with their care needs during personal hygiene activities (e.g., toileting, bathing, dressing), during medical/nursing treatments, and when r equested as 
appropriate.  
 People not involved in the care of the patient should not be present without his/her consent 
while he/she is being examined or treated.  If an individual requires assistance during 
toileting, bathing, and other personal hygiene activities, staff should assist, giving utmost 
attention to the individual’s need for privacy.  Privacy should be afforde d when the MD/DO 
or other staff visits the patient to discuss clinical care issues or conduct any examination or treatment.  
 However, audio/video monitoring (does not include recording) of patients in medical -
surgical or intensive -care type units would not be considered violating the patient’s privacy, 
as long as there exists a clinical need, the patient/patient’s representative is aware of the monitoring and the monitors or speakers are located so that the monitor screens are not 
readily visible or where speakers are not readily audible to visitors or the public.  Video 
recording of patients undergoing medical treatment requires  the consent of the patient or 
his/her representative.  
 
A patient’s right to privacy may also be limited in situations where a person must be continuously observed to ensure his or her safety, such as when a patient is simultaneously restrained and in seclusion to manage violent or self -destructive behavior or when the 
patient is under suicide precautions.  
 Protecting Patient Personal Information  
 The right to personal privacy also includes limiting the release or disclosure of patient information.  Patient information includes, but is not limited to, the patient’s presence or location in the hospital; demographic information the hospital has collec ted on the patient, 
such as name, age, address, income; or information on the patient’s medical condition.  Such patient information may not be disclosed without informing the patient or the patient’s representative in advance of the disclosure and providi ng the patient or the patient’s 
representative an opportunity to agree, prohibit, or restrict the disclosure.  Below is a summary of privacy issues that surveyors might encounter in hospital settings, and the related privacy requirements.  
 Permitted Disclosures:  
A hospital is permitted to use and disclose patient information, without the patient’s authorization, in order to provide patient care and perform related administrative functions, such as payment and other hospital operations.  
 
• Payment  operations include hospital activities to obtain payment or be reimbursed for 
the provision of health care to an individual. 
 • Hospital operations are administrative, financial, legal, and quality improvement 
activities of a hospital that are necessary to conduct business and to support the core functions of treatment and payment.  These activities include, but are not limited to:  quality assessment and improvement activities, case management and care 
coordination; competency assurance activities, conducting or arranging for medical reviews, audits, or legal services, including fraud and abuse detection and compliance programs; business planning, development, management, and administration and certain hospital -specific fundraising activities.  
 Hospitals must develop and implement policies and procedures that restrict access to and use of patient information based on the specific roles of the members of their workforce.  These policies and procedures must identify the persons, or classes of persons, in the workforce who need access to protected health information to carry out their duties and the categories of protected health information to which access is needed.  
 One example of a permitted disclosure is a Facility Directory.  It is common practice in 
many hospitals to maintain a directory of patient contact information. The hospital must inform the patient, or the patient’s representative, of the individual information that may be 
included in a directory and the persons to whom such information may be disclosed.  The 
patient, or the patient’s representative, must be given the opportunity to restrict or prohibit 
any or all uses and disclosures.  The hospital may rely on a patient’s/r epresentative’s 
individual’s informal permission to list in its facility directory the patient’s name, general condition, religious affiliation, and location in the provider’s facility.
  The provider may 
then disclose the patient’s condition and location i n the facility to anyone asking for the 
patient by name, and also may disclose religious affiliation to clergy.  If the opportunity to prohibit or restrict uses and disclosures cannot be provided due to the patient’s incapacity or emergency treatment circumstance, and there is no patient representative available, the hospital may disclose patient information for the facility’s directory if such disclosure is in the patient’s best interest.  The hospital must provide the patient or the patient’s 
representative an opportunity to prohibit or restrict disclosure as soon as i t becomes 
practicable to do so.  The hospital may use patient information to notify, or assist in the 
notification of, a family member, a personal representative of the patient, or another person responsible for the care of the patient of their location, general condition, or death.  The 
hospital must have procedures in place, in accordance with State law, to provide appropriate 
information to patient families or others in those situations where the patient is unable to 
make their wishes known. 
 
Incidental Uses and Disclosures May be Acceptable:   An incidental use or disclosure is a secondary use or disclosure of patient information that cannot reasonably be prevented, is limited in nature, and that occurs as a result of another use or disclosure that is permitted.  Many customary health care communications and practices play an important role in ensuring the prompt delivery of effective care.  Due to the nature of these communications and practices, as well as of the hospital environment, the potential exists for a patient’s information to be disclosed incidentally.  For example, a hospital visitor may overhear a health care professional’s confidential conversation with another health care professional or the patient, or may glimpse a patient’s information on a sign- in sheet or nursing station white board.   The regulation protecting patient privacy does 
not impede these customary and essential communications and practices and, thus, a hospital is not required to eliminate all risk of incidental use or disclosure secondary to a permitted use or disclo sure, so long as  the hospital takes reasonable safeguards and 
discloses only the minimum amount of personally identifiable information necessary.   For example, hospitals may:   
• Use patient care signs (e.g. “falls risk” or “diabetic diet” ) displayed at the bedside or outside a patient room;  
 
• Display patient names on the outside of patient charts; or  
 
• Use “whiteboards” that list the patients present on a unit, in an operating room suite, etc. 
 Hospitals are expected to review their practices and determine what steps are reasonable to safeguard patient information while not impeding the delivery of safe patient care or incurring undue administrative or financial burden as a result of implementing privacy safeguards.  
 
Examples of reasonable safeguards could include, but are not limited to:  
 
• Requesting that waiting customers stand a few feet back from a counter used for patient registration; 
 
• Use of dividers or curtains in areas where patient and physician or other hospital staff communications routinely occur;  
 
• Health care staff speaking quietly when discussing a patient’s condition or treatment 
in a semi -private room;  
 
• Utilizing passwords and other security measures on computers maintaining 
personally identifiable health information; or  
 
• Limiting access to areas where white boards or x -ray light boards are in use, or 
posting the board on a wall not readily visible to the public, or limiting the information placed on the board.  
 Survey Procedures §482.13(c)(1)  
 
• Conduct observations/interview patients or their representatives to determine if patients are provided reasonable privacy during examinations or treatments, personal hygiene activities and discussions about their health status/care and other appropriate si tuations.  
 
• Review hospital policy and interview staff concerning their understanding of the use of patient information in the facility directory.  Does the policy address the opportunity for the patient or patient’s representative to restrict or prohibit use of patie nt information in emergent and non -emergent situations?  
 
• Review hospital policy and conduct observations/interview staff to determine if reasonable safeguards are used to reduce incidental disclosures of patient information. 
 
• If audio and/or visual monitoring is utilized in the med/surg or ICU setting, conduct observations to determine that monitor screens and/or speakers are not readily visible or audible to visitors or the public.  
  
A-0144 
(Rev. 216; Issued:07- 21-23; Effective: 07 -21-23; Implementation: 07 -21-23)   
 §482.13(c)(2) -  The patient has the right to receive care in a safe setting.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(c)(2)  
The intention of this requirement is to specify that each patient receives care in an 
environment that a reasonable person, similarly situated as the patient, would consider to be 
safe. For example, hospital staff should follow current standards of practic e for patient 
environmental safety, infection control, and security. The hospital must protect vulnerable patients, including newborns and children. Additionally, this standard is intended to provide protection for the patient’s emotional health and safety as well as his/her physical safety. Respect, dignity, and comfort would also be components of an emotionally safe environment. To provide care in a safe setting, hospitals should identify patients at risk for intentional harm to self or others, identify e nvironmental safety risks for such patients, and 
provide education and training for staff and volunteers. Patients at risk of suicide (or other forms of self- harm), or who exhibit violent behaviors toward others, receive healthcare 
services in both inpatie nt and outpatient locations of hospitals. Therefore, non- psychiatric 
settings of all hospitals where patients with psychiatric conditions may be cared for should also identify patients at risk for intentional harm to self or others and mitigate environment al safety risks. Psychiatric patients requiring medical care in a non -psychiatric 
setting (medical inpatient units, ED, ICU, etc.) must be evaluated, monitored, and cared for appropriately when demonstrating suicidal ideation or potential harm to others. T he care 
could include, but not be limited to, utilizing safety measures such: as 1:1 monitoring with 
continuous visual observation, removal of sharp objects from the room/area, or removal of 
equipment that can be used as a weapon.  
Although all risks cannot be eliminated, hospitals should be able to demonstrate how they 
identify patients at risk of self -harm or harm to others and steps they are taking to minimize 
those risks in accordance with nationally recognized standards and guidelines.  
The potential risks include, but are not limited to, those from ligatures, sharps, harmful substances, access to medications, breakable windows, accessible light fixtures, plastic bags (for suffocation), oxygen tubing, bell cords, etc. 
Hospitals may find the recommendations and resources in the 2018 report, Recommended 
standard care for people with suicide risk: Making health care suicide safe, issued by the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention (Action Alliance), to be highly useful in developing the best practices for effective patient screening and assessment for those patients at risk for harm to themselves, as well as for improving the care of patients at risk of suicide.
1  The Action Alliance is the public -private partnership working to advance the 
National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and reduce the suicide rate 20 percent by 2025. Notably, the report advances two of the goals of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (National Strategy): (a) Promote suicide prevention as a core component of health care services; and (b) Promote and implement effective clinical and professional practices for assessing and treating those identified as being at risk for suicidal behaviors. (To download a copy of the National Strategy, please visit: www.actionallianceforsuicideprevention.org
). 
Identifying Patients at Risk  
There are numerous models and versions of patient risk assessment tools available to identify patients at risk for harm to self or others. No one- size-fits-all tool is available. 
Therefore, the type of patient risk assessment tool used should be appropriat e to the patient 
population, care setting, and staff competency. All hospitals should implement a patient risk assessment strategy, but it is up to the individual hospital to implement the appropriate strategies. For example, a patient risk assessment strategy in a post-partum unit would most likely not be the same risk assessment strategy utilized in the emergency department.  
Environmental Safety Risks 
Just as all hospitals should implement a patient risk assessment strategy, all hospitals should 
implement an environmental risk assessment strategy. Environmental risk assessment strategies may not be the same in all hospitals or hospital units. The hospit al implements 
environmental risk assessment strategies appropriate to its specific care environment and patient population. That does not mean that a unit which does not typically care for patients with psychiatric conditions should not be conducting envir onmental risk assessments. It 
means that the risk assessment must be appropriate to the unit and should consider the possibility that the unit may sometimes care for patients at risk for harm to self or others. While CMS does not require the use of an Environmental Risk Assessment Tool (e.g., the Veteran’s Administration Environmental Risk Assessment Tool), the use of such tools may be used as a way for the hospital to assess safety risks in all patient care environments to minimize environmental risks and to document the assessment findings. Examples of Environmental Risk Assessment Tool content may include prompts for staff to assess items such as, but not limited to: 
• Ligature risks such as handrails, doorknobs, door hinges, shower curtains, exposed 
plumbing/pipes, soap, and paper towel dispensers on walls, power cords on medical

equipment or call bell cords, light fixtures, or projections from ceilings, etc.  
• Unattended items such as utility or housekeeping carts that contain hazardous items 
(mops, brooms, cleaning agents, hand sanitizers, etc.)  
• Unsafe items brought to patients by visitors in locked psychiatric units of hospitals and psychiatric hospitals  
• Windows that can be opened or broken  
• Unprotected lighting fixtures; and  
• Inadequate staffing levels to provide appropriate patient observation and monitoring  
Hospital staff should be trained to identify environmental safety risks regardless of whether or not the hospital has chosen to implement the use of an environmental risk assessment tool to identify potential or actual risks in the patient care environment . 
Education and Training  
Hospitals should provide the appropriate level of education and training to staff regarding the identification of patients at risk of harm to self or others, the identification of environmental patient safety risk factors, and mitigation strategies. Staff includes direct employees, volunteers, contractors, per diem staff, and any other individuals providing clinical care under arrangement. Hospitals have the flexibility to tailor the training to the particular services staff provide and the patient populati ons they serve. Hospitals should 
provide education and training to all new staff initially upon orientation and whenever policies and procedures change. However, CMS recommends initial training and then 
ongoing training at least every two years thereafter. 
Correction of Environmental Risks  
Cited noncompliance that include ligature risks, which do not pose an immediate jeopardy 
situation or no longer pose an immediate jeopardy situation because the immediate threat to patient health and safety has been removed by the hospital, or has been mit igated through 
the implementation of appropriate interim patient safety measures, should be corrected as soon as possible, but within the timeframe noted by the CMS Location, the SA, or the AO. Interim patient safety measures are expected to be implemented  as part of an acceptable 
plan of correction to mitigate patient safety risks, as appropriate.  
Interim patient safety measures to mitigate identified ligature or safety risks may include, without limitation, continuous visual observation or 1:1 observation based on the type of identified risk.  
Survey Procedures §482.13(c)(2)  
• Review and analyze patient and staff incident and accident reports to identify any 
incidents or patterns of incidents concerning a safe environment. Expand your review if you suspect a problem with safe environment in the hospitals. 
• Interview staff in patient care areas to determine how the hospital has trained staff to 
identify risks in the care environment and, if found, how staff report those findings. 
• Observe and interview staff at units where infants and children are inpatients. Are 
appropriate security protections (such as alarms, arm banding systems, etc.) in place? Are they functioning?  
• Review policy and procedures on what the hospital does to curtail unwanted visitors, 
contaminated materials, or unsafe items that pose a safety risk to patients and staff.  
• Access the hospital’s security efforts to protect vulnerable patients including newborns, 
children, and patients at risk of suicide or intentional harm to self or others. Is the hospital providing appropriate security to protect patients? Are appropriate security mechanisms in place and being followed to protect patients? Security mechanisms are based on nationally recognized standards of practice.

§482.13(c)(3) -  The patient has the right to be free from all forms of abuse or 
harassment.  
 Interpretive Guidelines  §482.13(c)(3)  
 The intent of this requirement is to prohibit all forms of abuse, neglect (as a form of abuse) and harassment whether from staff, other patients or visitors.  The hospital must ensure that patients are free from all forms of abuse, neglect, or harassment.  The hospital must have mechanisms/methods in place that ensure patients are free of all forms of abuse, neglect, or harassment.  
 Abuse is defined as the willful infliction of injury, unreasonable confinement, intimidation, or punishment, with resulting physical harm, pain, or mental anguish.  This includes staff neglect or indifference to infliction of injury or intimidation of one patient by another.  Neglect, for the purpose of this requirement, is considered a form of abuse and is defined as the failure to provide goods and services necessary to avoid physical harm, mental anguish, or mental illness.  
 The following components are suggested as necessary for effective abuse protection:  
 
• Prevent .  A critical part of this system is that there are adequate staff on duty, 
especially during the evening, nighttime, weekends and holiday shifts, to take care of the individual needs of all patients.  (See information regarding meaning of adequate at thos e requirements that require the hospital to have adequate staff.  
Adequate staff would include that the hospital ensures that there are the number and 
types of qualified, trained, and experienced staff at the hospital and available to meet the care needs of every patient.)  
 
• Screen .  Persons with a record of abuse or neglect should not be hired or retained as 
employees.  
 
• Identify .  The hospital creates and maintains a proactive approach to identify events 
and occurrences that may constitute or contribute to abuse and neglect.  
 
• Train .  The hospital, during its orientation program, and through an ongoing 
training program, provides all employees with information regarding abuse and neglect, and related reporting requirements, including prevention, intervention, and detection.  
 
• Protect .  The hospital must protect patients from abuse during investigation of any 
allegations of abuse or neglect or harassment.  
 
• Investigate .  The hospital ensures, in a timely and thorough manner, objective 
investigation of all allegations of abuse, neglect or mistreatment.  
 
• Report/Respond .  The hospital must assure that any incidents of abuse, neglect or 
harassment are reported and analyzed, and the appropriate corrective, remedial or 
disciplinary action occurs, in accordance with applicable local, State, or Federal law.  
 As a result of the implementation of this system, changes to the hospital’s policies and procedures should be made accordingly.  Survey Procedures   §482.13(c)(3)  
 
• Examine the extent to which the hospital has a system in place to protect patients from abuse, neglect and harassment of all forms, whether from staff, other patients, visitors or other persons.  In particular, determine the extent to which the hospital addresses the following issues.  
 
o Are staffing levels across all shifts sufficient to care for individual patient’s needs?  
 
o Does the hospital have a written procedure for investigating allegations of abuse and neglect including methods to protect patients from abuse during investigations of allegations?  
 
o How does the hospital substantiate allegations of abuse and neglect?  
 
o Do incidents of substantiated abuse and neglect result in appropriate action?  
 
o Has the hospital implemented an abuse protection program?  Does it comply with Federal, State and local laws and regulations?  Is it effective?  
o Are appropriate agencies notified in accordance with State and Federal laws regarding incidents of substantiated abuse and neglect?  
 
o Can staff identify various forms of abuse or neglect?  
 
o Do staff members know what to do if they witness abuse and neglect?  
 
o What evidence is there that allegations of abuse and neglect are thoroughly investigated?  
 
o Does the hospital conduct criminal background checks as allowed by State law for all potential new hires?  
 
o Is there evidence the hospital employs people with a history of abuse, neglect or harassment?

§482.13(d)(1) - The patient has the right to the confidentiality of his or her clinical 
records.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(d)(1)  
 The right to confidentiality of the patient’s medical record means the hospital must safeguard the contents of the medical record, whether it is in paper or electronic format, or a combination of the two, from unauthorized disclosure.  Confidentiality appl ies wherever the 
record or portions thereof are stored, including but not limited to central records, patient care locations, radiology, laboratories, record storage areas, etc.  
 A hospital is permitted to disclose patient information, without a patient’s authorization, in order to provide patient care and perform related administrative functions, such as payment and other hospital operations.   
• Payment  operations include hospital activities to obtain payment or be reimbursed for 
the provision of health care to an individual. 
 • Hospital operations  are administrative, financial, legal, and quality improvement 
activities of a hospital that are necessary to conduct business and to support the core 
functions of treatment and payment. These activities include, but are not limited to:  quality assessment and improvement activities, case management and care 
coordination; competency assurance activities, conducting or arranging for medical reviews, audits, or legal services, including fraud and abuse detection and compliance programs; bus iness planning,  development, management, and administration and 
certain hospital -specific fundraising activities.  
 
The hospital must develop policies and procedures that reasonably limit disclosures of information contained in the patient’s medical record to the minimum necessary, even when the disclosure is for treatment or payment purposes, or as otherwise required by State or Federal law.  
 When the minimum necessary standard is applied, a hospital may not disclose the entire medical record for a particular purpose, unless it can specifically justify that the whole record is the amount reasonably needed for the purpose.  
 A hospital may make an authorized disclosure of information from the medical record electronically, and may also share an electronic medical record system with other health care facilities, physicians and practitioners, so long as the system is designed and operated with safeguards that ensure that only authorized disclosures are made.  
The hospital must obtain the patient’s, or the patient’s representative’s, written authorization for any disclosure of information in the medical record when the disclosure is not for treatment, payment or health care operations.   Survey Procedures §482.13(d)(1)  
 
• Verify that the hospital has policies and procedures addressing the protecting of information in patients’ medical record from unauthorized disclosures.  
 
• Observe locations where medical records are stored to determine whether appropriate safeguards are in place to protect medical record information.  
• Interview staff to determine their understanding of and compliance with the hospital’s policies and procedures for protecting medical record information.

current medical records, upon an oral or written request, in the form or format 
requested by the individual. If it is readily producible in such form and format (including in an electroni c form or format when such medical records are maintained 
electronically); or if not, in a readable hard copy form or such other form or format as agreed by the facility and the individual, and within a reasonable timeframe. The hospital mu st not frustrate the legitimate efforts of individuals to gain access to their 
own medical records and must actively seek to meet these requests as quickly as its record keeping system permits.   Interpretive Guidelines  §482.13(d)(2)

§482.13(e) Standard:  Restraint or seclusion.   All patients have the right to be 
free from physical or mental abuse, and corporal punishment.  All patients have the 
right to be free from restraint or seclusion, of any form, imposed as a means of 
coercion, discipline, convenience, or retaliation by staf f.   Restraint or seclusion may 
only be imposed to ensure the immediate physical safety of the patient, a staff 
member, or others and must be discontinued at the earliest possible time.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e) : 
 
The intent of this standard is to identify patients’ basic rights, ensure patient safety, and eliminate the inappropriate use of restraint or seclusion.  Each patient has the right to receive care in a safe setting.  The safety of the patient, staff, or ot hers is the basis for 
initiating and discontinuing the use of restraint or seclusion.  Each patient has the right to be free from all forms of abuse and corporal punishment.  Each patient has the right to be free from restraint or seclusion, of any form, i mposed as a means of coercion, discipline, 
convenience, or retaliation by staff.  Restraint or seclusion may not be used unless the use of restraint or seclusion is necessary to ensure the immediate physical safety of the patient, a staff member, or others .  The use of restraint or seclusion must be discontinued as soon as 
possible based on an individualized patient assessment and re -evaluation.  A violation of 
any of these patients’ rights constitutes an inappropriate use of restraint or seclusion and 
woul d be subject to a condition level deficiency.   
 
The patient  protections contained in this standard apply to all hospital  patients  when the 
use of restraint or seclusion becomes necessary, regardless of patient location.  T he 
requirements contained in this standard are not specific to any treatment setting within the 
hospital.  They are not targeted only to patients on psychiatric units or those with behavioral/mental health care needs.  Instead, the requirements are specific to the patient 
behavior that the restraint or seclusion intervention is being used to address.    In summary, these restraint and seclusion regulations apply to:  
 
• All hospitals (acute care, long- term care, psychiatric, children's, and cancer);  
 
• All locations within the hospital (including medical/surgical units, critical care 
units, forensic units, emergency department, psychiatric units, etc.); and  
 
• All hospital patients, regardless of age, who are restrained or secluded (including both inpatients and outpatients). 
 
The decision to use a restraint or seclusion is not driven by diagnosis, but by a 
comprehensive individual patient assessment.  For a given patient at a particular point in 
time, this comprehensive individualized patient assessment is used to determine whe ther the 
use of less restrictive measures poses a greater risk than the risk of using a restraint or seclusion.  The comprehensive assessment should include a physical assessment to identify medical problems that may be causing behavior changes in the pati ent.  For example, 
temperature elevations, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, drug interactions, and drug side effects may cause confusion, agitation, and combative behaviors.  Addressing 
these medical issues may eliminate or minimize the need for the use of restraints or seclusion.  Staff must assess and monitor a patient’s condition on an ongoing basis to ensure that the patient is released from restraint or seclusion at the earliest possible time.  Restraint or seclusion may only be employed while the unsafe situation continues.  Once the unsafe situation ends, the use of restraint or seclusion should be discontinued.  However, the decision to discontinue the intervention should be based on the determination that the need for restraint or seclusion is no longer present, or that the patient’s needs can be addressed using less restrictive methods.   Hospital leadership  is responsible for creating a culture that supports a patient’s right to be 
free from restraint or seclusion.  Leadership must ensure that systems and processes are developed, implemented, and evaluated that support the patients’ rights addressed in this standard, and that eliminate the inappropriate use of restraint or seclusion.  Through their QAPI program, hospital leadership should:  
 
• Assess and monitor the use of restraint or seclusion in their facility; 
 
• Implement actions to ensure that restraint or seclusion is used only to ensure the 
physical safety of the patient, staff and others; and  
 
• Ensure that the hospital complies with the requirements set forth in this standard as 
well as those set forth by State law and hospital policy when the use of restraint or 
seclusion is necessary.  
 Patients have a right to receive safe care in a safe environment.  However, the use of restraint is inherently risky.  When the use of restraint is necessary, the least restrictive method must be used to ensure a patient’s safety.  The use of restraint for  the management 
of patient behavior should not  be considered a routine part of care.   
 
The use of restraints for the prevention of falls should not be considered a routine part of a 
falls prevention program .  Although restraints have been traditionally used as a falls 
prevention approach, they have major, serious drawbacks and can contribute to serious 
injuries.  There is no evidence that the use of physical restraint, (including, but not limited to, raised side rails) will prevent or reduce falls.  Additionally, falls that occur while a person is physically restrained often result in more se vere injuries.
2   
In fact in some instances reducing the use of physical restraints may actually decrease the risk of falling.

 Consider, for example, a patient who is displaying symptoms of Sundowner’s Syndrome, a syndrome in which a patient 's dementia becomes more apparent at the end of the day than at 
the beginning of the day.  The patient is not acting out or behaving in a violent or self-destructive manner.  However, the patient has an unsteady gait and continues to get out of bed even af ter staff has tried alternatives to keep the patient from getting out of bed.  T here 
is nothing inherently dangerous about a patient being able to walk or wander, even at night.  Under the provisions of this regulation, the rationale that the patient should be restrained because he “might” fall does not  constitute an adequate basis for using a restraint for the 
purposes of this regulation.  When assessing a patient’s risk for falls and planning care for the patient, staff should consider whether the patient has a medical condition or symptom that indicates a current need for a protective intervention to prevent the patient from walking or getting out of bed.  A history of falling without a current clinical basis for a restraint intervention is inadequate to demonstrate the need for restraint.  It is important to

note that the regulation specifically states that convenience is not an acceptable reason to 
restrain a patient.  In addition, a restraint must not serve as a substitute for the adequate 
staffing needed to monitor patients. 
An individualized patient assessment is critical.  In this example, an assessment should minimally address the following questions:   
 
• Are there safety interventions or precautions (other than restraint) that can be taken to reduce the risk of the patient slipping, tripping, or falling if the patient gets out of bed?   
 
• Is there a way to enable the patient to safely ambulate?   
 
• Is there some assistive device that will improve the patient’s ability to self ambulate?   
 
• Is a medication or a reversible condition causing the unsteady gait?   
 
• Would the patient be content to walk with a staff person?   
 
• Could the patient be brought closer to the nurse’s station where he or she could be supervised?   
If an assessment reveals a medical condition or symptom that indicates the need for an intervention to protect the patient from harm, the regulation requires the hospital to use the least restrictive intervention that will effectively protect the patient f rom harm.  Upon 
making this determination, the hospital may consider the use of a restraint; however, that consideration should weigh the risks of using a restraint (which are widely documented in research) against the risks presented by the patient’s behavior.  If the hospital chooses to use the restraint, it must meet the requirements contained in this standard.  
 In addition, a request from a patient  or family member for the application of a restraint, 
which they would consider to be beneficial, is not a sufficient basis for the use of a restraint intervention.  A patient or family member request for a restraint intervention, such as a vest restraint or raising all four side rails, to keep the patient from getting out of bed or falling should prompt a patient  and situational assessment to determine whether such a restraint 
intervention is needed.  If a need for restraint is confirmed, the practitioner must then determine the type of restraint intervention that will meet the patient 's needs with the least 
risk and most benefit to the patient .  If restraint (as defined by the regulation) is used, then 
the requirements of the regulation must be met.    Patient care staff must demonstrate through their documentation in the patient’s medical record that the restraint intervention used is the least restrictive intervention that protects the patient’s safety, and that the use of restraint is based on individual assessments of the patient.  The assessments and documentation of those assessments must be ongoing in order to demonstrate a continued need for restraint.  Documentation by the physician or other staff once a day may not be adequate to support that the restraint intervention needs to continue and may not comply with the requirement to end the restraint as soon as possible.  A patient’s clinical needs often change over time. 
 
 
CMS does not consider the use of weapons  in the application of restraint or seclusion as a 
safe, appropriate health care intervention.  For the purposes of this regulation, the term “weapon” includes, but is not limited to, pepper spray, mace, nightsticks, tazers, cattle prods, stun guns, and pi stols.  Security staff may carry weapons as allowed by hospital 
policy, and State and Federal law.  However, the use of weapons by security staff is considered a law enforcement action, not a health care intervention.  CMS does not support the use of weapons by any hospital staff as a means of subduing a patient in order to place that patient in restraint or seclusion.  If a weapon is used by security or law enforcement 
personnel on a person in a hospital (patient, st aff, or visitor) to protect people or hospital 
property from harm, we would expect the situation to be handled as a criminal activity and 
the perpetrator be placed in the custody of local law enforcement. 
 
The use of handcuffs, manacles, shackles, other chain-type restraint devices, or other restrictive devices applied by non-hospital employed or contracted law enforcement officials for custody, detention, and public safety reasons are not governed by this rule.  The use of such devices are considered law enforcement restraint devices and would not be considered safe, appropriate health care restraint interventions for use by hospital staff to restrain patients.   The law enforcement officers who maintain cust ody 
and direct supervision of their prisoner (the hospital’s patient) are responsible for the use, application, and monitoring of these restrictive devices in accordance with Federal and State law.  However, the hospital is still responsible for an appropr iate patient assessment 
and the provision of safe, appropriate care to its patient (the law enforcement officer’s prisoner).  
 
Survey Procedures §482.13(e) 
 
• Review hospital restraint and seclusion policies and procedures to determine if they address, at a minimum: 
 
o Who has the authority to discontinue the use of restraint or seclusion (based on State law and hospital policies); and 
 o Circumstances under which restraint or seclusion should be discontinued. (Also see § 482.13(e)(3)).
 
 
• Review a sample of medical records of patients for whom restraints were used to manage non-violent, non- self-destructive behavior, as well as a sample of medical 
records of patients for whom restraint or seclusion was used to manage violent or self-destructive behavior; 
 
 
• Include in the review patients who are currently in restraint or seclusion, as well as 
those who have been in restraint or seclusion during their hospital stay (include both 
violent or self- destructive patients as well as non -violent, non- self-destructive 
patients).   
 
• What evidence is there that hospital staff identified the reason for the restraint or 
seclusion, and determined that other less restrictive measures would not be effective before applying the restraint? 
 
• Interview staff who work directly with patients to determine their understanding of 
the restraint and seclusion policies.  If any patients are currently in restraint or seclusion, ascertain the rationale for use and when the patient was last monitored and assessed.  
 
• Is the actual use of restraints or seclusion consistent with hospital restraint and 
seclusion policies and procedures, as well as CMS requirements? 
 
• Review incident and accident reports to determine whether patient injuries occurred 
proximal to or during a restraint or seclusion intervention.  Are incidents and accidents occurring more frequently with restrained or secluded patients?  
 
• If record review indicates that restrained or secluded patients sustained injuries, 
determine what the hospital did to prevent additional injury.  Determine if the hospital investigated possible changes to its restraint or seclusion policies. 
 
• Obtain data on the use of restraint and seclusion for a specified time period (e.g., 3 
months) to determine any patterns in their use for specific units, shifts, days of the 
week, etc.   
 
• Does the number of patients who are restrained or secluded increase on weekends, 
on holidays, at night, on certain shifts; where contract nurses are used; in one unit 
more than other units?  Such patterns of restraint or seclusion use may suggest that 
the intervention is not based on the patient’s need, but on issues such as convenience, inadequate staffing or lack of staff training.  Obtain nursing staffing schedules during time periods in question to determine if staffing levels impact the 
use of restrain t or seclusion. 
 
• Interview a random sample of patients who were restrained to manage non- violent, 
non-self-destructive behavior.  Were the reasons for the use of a restraint to manage 
non-violent, non- self-destructive behavior explained to the patient in understandable 
terms?  Could the patient articulate his/her understanding?

§482.13(e)  (1) Definitions. (i) A restraint is — 
 
(A)  Any manual method, physical or mechanical device, material, or equipment that immobilizes or reduces the ability of a patient to move his or her arms, legs, body, or head freely; or  
 
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(1)(i)(A)  
 
This restraint definition applies to all  uses of restraint in all  hospital care settings.  Under 
this definition, commonly used hospital devices and other practices could meet the definition of a restraint, such as:  
 
• Tucking a patient’s sheets in so tightly that the patient cannot move;  
 
• Use of a “net bed” or an “enclosed bed” that prevents the patient from freely exiting 
the bed.  EXCEPTION :  Placement of a toddler in an "enclosed" or "domed" crib;  
 
• Use of "Freedom" splints that immobilize a patient's limb;  
 
• Using side rails to prevent a patient from voluntarily getting out of bed; or  
 
• Geri chairs or recliners, only  if the patient cannot easily remove the restraint 
appliance and get out of the chair on his or her own. 
 NOTE :  Generally, if a patient can easily remove a device, the device would not be 
considered a restraint.  In this context, “easily remove” means that the manual method, device, material, or equipment can be removed intentionally by the patient in the same manner as it was applied by the staff (e.g., side rails are put down, not climbed over; buckles are intentionally unbuckled; ties or knots  are 
intentionally untied; etc.) considering the patient’s physical condition and 
ability to accomplish objective (e .g., transfer to a chair, get to the bathroom in 
time).  
 Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(1)(i)(A)  
 
• Determine whether the hospital’s policy and procedures employ a definition or 
description of what constitutes a restraint that is consistent with the regulation.  
 
• While touring hospital units look for restraints in use.  Where a restraint is in use, check the medical record for appropriate documentation.
 
 
• Interview hospital staff to determine whether they know the definition of a restraint.

(Rev. 37, Issued:  10- 17-08; Effective/Implementation Date:  10 -17-08) 
 §482.13(e)(1)(i)(B)  [A restraint is -  ] A drug or medication when it is used as a 
restriction to manage the patient's behavior or restrict the patient's freedom of movement and is not a standard treatment or dosage for the patient's condition.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(1)(i)(B)  
 
Drugs or medications that are used as part of a patient 's standard medical or psychiatric 
treatment, and are administered within the standard dosage for the patient’s condition, would not be subject to the requirements of standard (e).  These regulations  are not intended 
to interfere with the clinical treatment of patients who are suffering from serious mental illness and who need therapeutic doses of medication to improve their level of functioning so that they can more actively participate in their treatment.  Similarly, these regulations  are 
not intended to interfere with appropriate doses of sleeping medication prescribed for patients with insomnia, anti- anxiety medication prescribed to calm a patient  who is anxious, 
or analgesics prescribed for pain management.  The regulatory language is intended to provide flexibility and recognize the variations in patient  conditions.  
 Whether or not an order for a drug or medication is PRN (Latin abbreviation for pro re nata - as needed; as circumstances require) or a standing -order does not determine whether or 
not the use of that drug or medication is considered a restraint.  The use of PRN or standing- order drugs or medications is only prohibited if the drug or medication meets the 
definition of a drug or medication used as a restraint.  Criteria used to determine whether the use of a drug or medication, or combination of drugs or medications is a standard treatment or dosage for the patient 's condition includes all of 
the following:  
 
• The drug or medication is used within the pharmaceutical parameters approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer for the indications 
that it is manufactured and labeled to address, including listed dosage parameters;      
 
• The use of the drug or medication follows national practice standards established or 
recognized by the medical community, or professional medical associations or 
organizations; and,  
 
• The use of the drug or medication to treat a specific patient’ s clinical condition is 
based on that patient 's symptoms, overall clinical situation, and on the physician's or 
other licensed independent practitioner’s (LIP) knowledge of that patient 's expected 
and actual response to the medication.  
 
Another component of “standard treatment or dosage” for a drug or medication is the 
expectation that the standard use of a drug or medication to treat the patient 's condition 
enables the patient  to more effectively or appropriately function in the world around them 
than would be possible without the use of the drug or medication.  If the overall effect of a 
drug or medication, or combination of drugs or medications, is to reduce the patient 's ability 
to effectively or appropriately interact with the world around the patient , then the drug or 
medication is not  being used as a standard treatment or dosage for the patient 's condition.   
 
As with any use of restraint or seclusion, staff must conduct a comprehensive patient  
assessment to determine the need for other types of interventions before using a drug or medication as a res traint.   For example, a patient  may be agitated due to pain, an adverse 
reaction to an existing drug or medication, or other unmet care need or concern.  
 There are situations where the use of a drug or medication is clearly outside the standard for a patient  or a situation, or a medication is not medically necessary but is used f or patient  
discipline or staff convenience (neither of which is permitted by the regulation) .   
 
• EXAMPLE 1:  A patient  has Sundowner's Syndrome, a syndrome in which a 
patient's deme ntia becomes more apparent at the end of the day rather than at the 
beginning of the day.  The patient  may become agitated, angry, or anxious at 
sundown.  This may lead to wandering, pacing t he floors, or other nervous 
behaviors.  The staff finds the patient ’s behavior bothersome, and asks the physician 
to order a high dose of a sedative to “knock out” the patient  and keep him in bed.  
The patient  has no medical symptoms or condition that indicates the need for a 
sedative.  In this case, for this patient , the sedative is being used inappropriately as a 
restraint for staff convenience.  Such use is not permitted by the regulation.  A drug or medication that is not being used as a standard treatment for the patient’s medical or psychiatric condition, and that results in restricting the patient’s freedom of movement would be a drug used as a restraint.  
 
In addition, the regulation does not permit a drug or medication to be used to 
restrain the patient  for staff convenience, to coerce or discipline the patient , or as a 
method of retaliation.  While drugs or medications can be a beneficial part of a carefully constructed, individualized treatment plan for the patient , drug and 
medication use should be based on the assessed needs of the individual patient,  and 
the effects of drugs and medications on the patient  should be carefully monitored.  
 
• EXAMPLE 2:  A patient is in a detoxification program.  The patient becomes violent and aggressive.  Staff administers a PRN medication ordered by the patient’s physician or other LIP to address these types of outbursts.  The use of the medication enables the patient t o better interact with others or function more 
effectively.  In this case, the medication used for this patient is not considered a “drug used as a restraint.”  The availability of a PRN medication to manage outbursts of specific behaviors, suc h as aggressive, violent behavior is standard for 
this patient’s medical condition (i.e., drug or alcohol withdrawal).  Therefore, this patient’s medication does not meet the definition of “drug used as a restraint” since it is a standard treatment or dosa ge for the patient’s medical or psychiatric 
condition.  The use of this medication for this patient is not affected by standard (e).  
 
If a drug or medication is used as a standard treatment (as previously defined) to address the assessed symptoms and needs of a patient with a particular medical or psychiatric condition, its use is not subject to the requirements of this regulation.  However, the patient would still need to receive assessments, monitoring, interventions, and care that are appropriate for that patient’s needs.  
 The regulation supports existing State laws that provide more vigorous promotion of the patient’s choice and rights.  Therefore, when a State’s law prohibits the administration of drugs against the wishes of the patient without a court order, the State law  applies.  
 Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(1)(i)(B)  
 
• Determine whether the hospital’s policies and procedures employ a definition or 
description of what constitutes the use of drugs or medications as a restraint that is consistent with the regulation.
 
 
• Interview hospital staff to determine whether they can identify when the use of a drug or medication is considered a chemical restraint.

(Rev. 37, Issued:  10- 17-08; Effective/Implementation Date:  10 -17-08) 
 
§482.13(e)(1)(i)(C) -  A restraint does not include devices, such as orthopedically 
prescribed devices, surgical dressings or bandages, protective helmets, or other methods that involve the physical holding of a patient for the purpose of conducting routine physical examinations or tests, or to protect the patient from falling out of bed, or to permit the patient to participate in activities without the risk of physical harm (this does not include a physical escort).  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(1)(i)(C)  
 The devices and methods listed here would not be considered restraints, and, therefore, not subject to these requirements.  These devices and methods are typically used in medical -
surgical care.  
 Use of an IV arm board to stabilize an IV line is generally not considered a restraint.  However, if the arm board is tied down (or otherwise attached to the bed), or the entire limb is immobilized such that the patient cannot access his or her body, the use of the arm board would be considered a restraint. 
 A mechanical support  used to achieve proper body position, balance, or alignment so as to 
allow greater freedom of mobility than would be possible without the use of such a mechanical support is not considered a restraint.  For example, some patients lack the ability to walk without the use of leg braces, or to sit upright without neck, head, or back braces.  
 A medically necessary positioning or securing device used to maintain the position, limit 
mobility, or temporarily immobilize the patient during medical, dental, diagnostic, or surgical procedures is not considered a restraint.   
 Recovery from anesthesia  that occurs when the patient is in a critical care or 
postanesthesia  care unit is considered part of the surgical procedure; therefore, medically 
necessary restraint use in this setting would not need to meet the requirements of the regulation.  However, if the intervention is maintained when the patient is transferred to another unit, or recovers from the effects of the anesthesia (whichever occurs first), a restraint order would be necessary and the requirements of standard (e) would apply.  Many types of hand mitts would not be considered restraint.  However, pinning or otherwise attaching those same mitts to bedding or using a wrist restraint in conjunction with the hand mitts would meet the definition of restraint and the requirements would apply.  In addition, if the mitts are applied so tightly that the patient's hand or fingers are immobilized, this would be considered restraint and the requirements would apply.  Likewise, if the mitts are so bulky that the patient's ability to use their hands is significantly reduced, this would be considered restraint and the requirements would apply.  NOTE:   Because this definition of physical restraint does not name each device and 
situation that can be used to immobilize or reduce the ability of the patient to 
move his or her arms, legs, body or head freely, it promotes looking at each 
patient situation on a case-by- case basis.   
 In addition, if a patient can easily remove a device, the device would not be considered a restraint.  In this context, “easily remove” means that the manual method, device, material, or equipment can be removed intentionally by the patient in the same manner as it was applied by the staff (e.g., side rails are put down, not climbed over; buckles are intentionally unbuckled; ties or knots are intentionally untied; etc.) considering the patient’s physical condition and ability to accomplish the objective (e.g., transfer to a chair, get to the bathroom in time).  
 Age or developmentally appropriate protective safety interventions  (such as stroller 
safety belts, swing safety belts, high chair lap belts, raised crib rails, and crib covers) that a safety -conscious child care provider outside a health care setting would utilize to protect an 
infant, toddler, or preschool-aged child would not be considered restraint or seclusion for the purposes of this regulation.  The use of these safety interventions needs to be addressed in the hospital’s policies or procedures.  Physical Escort  
 A physical escort would include a “light” grasp to escort the patient to a desired location.  If the patient can easily remove or escape the grasp, this would not be considered physical restraint.  However, if the patient cannot easily remove or escape the grasp, this would be considered physical restraint and all the requirements would apply.  Physical holding  
 The regulation permits the physical holding of a patient  for the purpose of conducting 
routine physical examinations or tests.  However, patients do have the right to refuse treatment.  See § 482.13(b)(2). 
 This includes the right to refuse physical examinations or 
tests.  Holding a patient  in a manner that restricts the patient 's movement against the 
patient’s will is considered restraint.  This includes holds that some member of the medical community may term “therapeutic holds.”   Many deaths have occurred while employing 
these practices.  Physically holding a patient can be just as restrictive, and just as dangerous, as restraining methods that involve devices.  Physically holding a patient during a forced psychotropic medication procedure is considered a restraint and is not included in 
this exception.   
 For the purposes of this regulation, a staff member picking up, redirecting, or holding an infant, toddler, or preschool-aged child to comfort the patient  is not considered restraint.   
 Physical Holding for Forced Medications    The application of force to physically hold a patient, in order to administer a medication against the patient’s wishes, is considered restraint.  The patient has a right to be free of restraint and, in accordance with §482.13(b)(2
), also has a right to refuse medications, 
unless a court has ordered medication treatment.  A court order for medication treatment only removes the patient’s right to refuse the medication.  Additionally, in accordance with State law, some patients may be  medicated against their will in certain emergency 
circumstances.  However, in both of these circumstances, health care staff is expected to use 
the least restrictive method of administering the medication to avoid or reduce the use of 
force, when possible .  The use of force in order to medicate a patient, as with other restraint, 
must have a physician’s order prior to the application of the restraint (use of force).  If physical holding for forced medication is necessary with a violent patient, the 1-hour face -
to-face evaluation requirement would also apply. 
 
In certain circumstances, a patient may consent to an injection or procedure, but may not be 
able to hold still for an injection, or cooperate with a procedure.  In such circumstances, and 
at the patient’s request, staff may “hold” the patient in order to safely administer an injection (or obtain a blood sample, or insert an intravenous line, if applicable) or to conduct a procedure.  This is not  considered restraint.  
 Side rails  
 A restraint does not include methods that protect the patient  from falling out of bed.  
Examples include raising the side rails when a patient  is:  on a stretcher, recovering from 
anesthesia, sedated, experiencing involuntary movement, or on certain types of therapeutic 
beds to prevent the patient from falling out of the bed.  The use of side rails in these 
situations protects the patient from falling out of bed and, therefore, would not be subject to the requirements of standard (e).  
 However, side rails are frequently not used as a method to prevent the patient from falling out of bed, but instead, used to restrict the patient’s freedom to exit the bed.  The use of side rails to prevent the patient from exiting the bed would be conside red a restraint and would 
be subject to the requirements of standard (e).  The use of side rails is inherently risky, particularly if the patient is elderly or disoriented.  Frail elderly patients may be at risk for entrapment between the mattress or bed f rame and the side rail.  Disoriented patients may 
view a raised side rail as a barrier to climb over, may slide between raised, segmented side rails, or may scoot to the end of the bed to get around a raised side rail and exit the bed.  When attempting to leave the bed by any of these routes, the patient is at risk for entrapment, entanglement, or falling from a greater height posed by the raised side rail, with a possibility for sustaining greater injury or death than if the patient had fallen from the height of a lowered bed without raised side rails.  In short, the patient  may have an 
increased risk for a fall or other injury by attempting to exit the bed with the side rails raised.  The risk presented by side rail use should be weighed against the risk presented by the patient 's behavior as ascertained through individualized assessment.  
 When the clinician raises all four side rails in order to restrain a patient , defined in this 
regulation as immobilizing or reducing the ability of a patient  to move his or her arms, legs, 
body, or head freely to ensure the immediate physical safety of the patient , then the 
requirements of this rule apply.  Raising fewer than four side rails when the bed has segmented side rails would not necessarily immobilize or reduce the ability of a patient  to 
move freely as defined in the regulation.  For example, if the side rails are segmented and all but one segment are raised to allow the patient to freely exit the bed, the side rail is not acting as a restraint and the requirements of this rule would not apply.  Conversely, if a patient is not physically able to get out of bed regardless of whether the side rails are raised or not, raising all four side rails for this patient would not be considered restraint because the side rails have no impact on the patient’s freedom of movement.  In this example, the use of al l four side rails would not be considered restraint.  Therefore, the requirements of 
this rule would not  apply. 
 When a patient is on a bed that constantly moves to improve circulation or prevents skin breakdown, raised side rails are a safety intervention to prevent the patient from falling out of bed and are not viewed as restraint.  
 When a patient is placed on seizure precautions  and all side rails are raised, the use of side 
rails would not be considered restraint.  The use of padded side rails in this situation should 
protect the patient from harm; including falling out of bed should the patient have a seizure.  
 
Placement in a crib with raised rails is an age- appropriate standard safety practice for every 
infant or toddler.  Therefore, placement of an infant or toddler in the crib with raised rails would not be considered restraint.   
 
If the patient is on a stretcher  (a narrow, elevated, and highly mobile cart used to transport 
patients and to evaluate or treat patients), there is an increased risk of falling from a 
stretcher without raised side rails due to its narrow width, and mobility.  In addition, because stretchers are elevated platforms, the risk of patient injury due to a fall is significant.  Therefore, the use of raised side rails on stretchers is not considered restraint but a prudent safety intervention.  Likewise, the use of a seat belt when transporting a patient in a wheelchair is not considered restraint.  
Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(1)(i)(C)  
 
• Determine whether the hospital’s policies and procedures employ a definition or description of what constitutes a restraint that is consistent with the regulation.
 
 
• While touring hospital units look for bed side rail use to determine whether it is consistent with the definition of a restraint.  Where bed side rails are being used as a restraint, check the medical record for appropriate documentation.
 
 
• Interview hospital staff to determine whether they know the definition of a restraint, particularly with respect to use of bed side rails.

§482.13(e)(1)(ii) -  Seclusion is the involuntary confinement of a patient alone in a room 
or area from which the patient is physically prevented from leaving. Seclusion may only be used for the management of violent or self -destructive behavior.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(1)(ii)  
 
Seclusion may only be used for the management of violent or self -destructive behavior that 
jeopardizes the immediate physical safety of the patient, a staff member, or others.  
 
Seclusion is not just confining a patient to an area, but involuntarily confining the patient alone in a room or area where the patient is physically prevented from leaving.  If a patient is restricted to a room alone and staff are physically intervening t o prevent the patient from 
leaving the room or giving the perception that threatens the patient with physical intervention if the patient attempts to leave the room, the room is considered locked, whether the door is actually locked or not.  In this situat ion, the patient is being secluded.  
 A patient physically restrained alone in an unlocked room does not constitute seclusion.  
 Confinement on a locked unit or ward where the patient is with others does not constitute seclusion.  Timeout is not considered seclusion.  Timeout  is an intervention in which the patient 
consents to being alone in a designated area for an agreed upon timeframe from which the patient is not physically prevented from leaving.  Therefore, the patient can leave the designated area when the patient choos es.   
 
Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(1)(ii)  
 
• Determine whether the hospital’s policy and procedures employ a definition or description of what constitutes seclusion that is consistent with the regulation.
 
 
• While touring hospital units look for cases where a patient is in seclusion.  
 
• Interview hospital staff to determine whether they know the definition of seclusion.

§482.13(e)(2) - Restraint or seclusion may only be used when less restrictive interventions have been determined to be ineffective to protect the patient, a staff member, or others from harm.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(2)  
 A comprehensive assessment of the patient must determine that the risks associated with the use of the restraint or seclusion is outweighed by the risk of not using the restraint or seclusion.  Less restrictive interventions do not always need to be tried, but less restrictive interventions must be determined by staff to be ineffective to protect the patient or others from harm prior to the introduction of more restrictive measures.  Alternatives attempted or the rationale for not using alternatives must be documented.    The underpinning of this regulation is the concept that safe patient care hinges on looking at the patient as an individual and assessing the patient’s condition, needs, strengths, weaknesses, and preferences.  Such an approach relies on caregivers who are skilled in individualized assessment and in tailoring interventions to the individual patient’s needs after weig hing factors such as the patient’s condition, behaviors, history, and environmental 
factors.  
 Resources are available to assist clinicians in identifying less restrictive interventions.  For example, the American Psychiatric Association (APA), American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA), and the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems  
(NAPHS), with support from the American Hospital Association (AHA), have sponsored the publication of a document entitled, “Learning from Each Other—Success Stories and Ideas for Reducing Restraint/Seclusion in Behavioral Health.”  This document, published in 2003, was developed through dialogue with clinicians in the field and included extensive input from behavioral healthcare providers throughout the country who have been working to reduce the use of restraint and seclusion and to improve care within their facilities.

(i) in accordance with a written modification to the patient's plan of care.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(4)(i)  
 
The use of restraint or seclusion (including drugs or medications used as restraint as well as physical restraint) must be documented in the patient’s plan of care or treatment plan.  The use of restraint or seclusion constitutes a change in a patient’s pl an of care.   
 The regulation does not require that a modification to the patient’s plan of care be made before initiating or obtaining an order for the use of restraint or seclusion.  The use of a restraint or seclusion intervention should be reflected in the patient’s plan of care or treatment plan based on an assessment and evaluation of the patient.  The plan of care or treatment plan should be reviewed and updated in writing within a timeframe specified by hospital policy.   Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(4)(i)  
 
• Determine whether the hospital’s procedures are consistent with the requirements of this regulation.  Does the plan of care or treatment reflect a process of assessment, intervention, and evaluation when restraint or seclusion is used?  
 
• Is there evidence of assessment of the identified problem or of an individual patient assessment?  
 
• Does the patient’s plan of care reflect that assessment? 
 
• What was the goal of the intervention?   
 
• What was the described intervention?  
 
• Who is responsible for implementation?  
 
• Was the patient informed of the changes in his or her treatment plan or plan of care?  
 
• Did the physician or other LIP write orders that included a time limit?  Were these 
orders incorporated into the plan of care?  
 
• After the discontinuation of the restraint or seclusion intervention, was this 
information documented in an update of the plan of care or treatment plan?

 §482.13(e)(5) -  The use of restraint or seclusion must be in accordance with the order 
of a physician or other licensed practitioner who is responsible for the care of the patient and authorized to order restraint or seclusion by hospital policy in accordance with State law.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(5)  
 Hospitals must have policies and procedures for the initiation of restraint or seclusion that identify the categories of licensed practitioners (LPs) that are permitted to order restraint or seclusion in that hospital, consistent with State law.  
 The regulation requires that a physician or other LP responsible for the care of the patient to order restraint or seclusion prior to the application of restraint or seclusion.  In some situations, however, the need for a restraint or seclusion intervention may occur so quickly that an order cannot be obtained prior to the application of restraint or seclusion.  In these emergency application situations, the order must be obtained either during the emergency application of the restraint or seclusion, or imm ediately (within a few minutes) after the 
restraint or seclusion has been applied.  The failure to immediately obtain an order is viewed as the application of restraint or seclusion without an order.  The hospital should address this process in its restrai nt and seclusion policies and procedures.  The policies and 
procedures should specify who can initiate the emergency application of restraint or seclusion prior to obtaining an order from a physician or other LP.  
  
Licensed Practitioner (LP)  
 For the purpose of  ordering restraint or seclusion, an LP is any practitioner permitted by 
State law and hospital policy as having the authority to order restraints or seclusion for 
patients.  
 
A resident who is authorized by State law and the hospital’s residency program to practice as a physician can carry out functions reserved for a physician or LP by the regulation.  A medical school student holds no license, and his/her work is reviewed and must be 
countersigned by the attending physician; therefore, he or she is not licensed or independent.  A medical school student is not a LP.  Protocols  
 A protocol cannot serve as a substitute for obtaining a physician's or other LP’s order prior to initiating each episode of restraint or seclusion use.  If a hospital uses protocols that include the use of restraint or seclusion, a specific physician or LP  order is still required for 
each episode of restraint or seclusion use.  The philosophy that serves as a foundation for the regulation is that restraint or seclusion use is an exceptional event, not a routine response to a certain patient condition or behavior.  Each patient must be assessed, and interventions should be tailored to meet the individual patient’s needs.  The creation of a protocol can run counter to this philosophy if it sets up the expectation that restraint or seclusion will be used as a r outine part of care.  The use of restraint or seclusion is a last 
resort when less restrictive measures have been determined ineffective to ensure the safety of the patient, staff or others, should not be a standard response to a behavior or patient need.  
 Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(5)  
 
• Review hospital policies and medical staff by -laws to ascertain clinical practice 
guidelines that describe the responsibilities of medical staff and clinicians who are privileged to order restraint and seclusion. 
 
• Do the hospital’s written policies identify what categories of practitioners the State recognizes as an LP or as having the authority to order restraint and seclusion?  
 
• Does the hospital have written policies indicating which practitioners are permitted to order restraint or seclusion in the facility?  
• Do the hospital’s written policies conform to State law?  
 
• Does the hospital have established policies for who can initiate restraint or 
seclusion?  
 
• Does the hospital utilize protocols for the use of restraint or seclusion?  If so, is the use of protocols consistent with the requirements of the regulation?  
 
• Do the medical records reviewed identify the physician or LP who ordered each use 
of restraint or seclusion?  
 
• During the medical record review, verify that a physician or LP order was obtained prior to the initiation of restraint or seclusion.  When emergency application of restraint or seclusion was necessary, verify that a physician or LP order was obtained imme diately (within a few minutes) after application of the restraint or 
seclusion. 
 
A-0169 
(Rev. 37, Issued:  10- 17-08; Effective/Implementation Date:  10 -17-08) 
§482.13(e)(6) -  Orders for the use of restraint or seclusion must never be written as a 
standing order or on an as needed basis (PRN).  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(6)  
This regulation prohibits the use of standing or PRN (Latin abbreviation for pro re nata - as 
needed; as circumstances require) orders for the use of restraint or seclusion.  The ongoing authorization of restraint or seclusion is not permitted.  Each episode of restraint or seclusion must be initiated in accordance with the order of a physician or other LIP.  If a patient was recently released from restraint or seclusion, and exhibits behavior that can only be handled through the reapplication of restraint or seclusion, a new order would be required.  Staff cannot discontinue a restraint or seclusion intervention, and then re- start it 
under the same order.  This would constitute a PRN order.  A “trial release” constitutes a PRN use of restraint or seclusion, and, therefore, is not permitted by this regulation.  When a staff member ends an ordered restraint or seclusion intervention, the staff member has no authority to reinstitute the intervention without a new order.  For example, a patient  
is released from restraint or seclusion based on the staff’s assessment of the patient’s condition.  If this patient  later exhibits behavior that jeopardizes the immediate physical 
safety of the patient , a staff member, or others that can only be handled through the use of 
restraint or seclusion, a new order would be required.    NOTE : A temporary, directly-supervised release, however, that occurs for the purpose 
of caring for a patient 's needs (e.g., toileting, feeding, or range of motion 
exercises) is not  considered a discontinuation of the restraint or seclusion 
intervention.  As long as the patient remains under direct staff supervision, the restraint is not considered to be discontinued because the staff member is present and is serving the same purpose as the restraint or seclusion.  
 The use of PRN orders for drugs or medications is only prohibited when a drug or medication is being used as a restraint.  A drug or medication is deemed to be a restraint only if it is not a standard treatment or dosage for the patient’s condition, and the drug or medication is a restriction to manage the patient’s behavior or restricts the patient’s freedom of movement  Using a drug to restrain the patient for staff convenience is expressly prohibited.  
EXCEPTIONS  
 
• Geri chair.  If a patient requires the use of a Geri chair with the tray locked in place in order for the patient to safely be out of bed, a standing or PRN order is permitted.  Given that a patient may be out of bed in a Geri chair several times a day, it is not necessary to obtain a new order each time.  
 
• Raised side rails.   If a patient's status requires that all bedrails be raised (restraint) 
while the patient is in bed, a standing or PRN order is permitted.  It is not necessary to obtain a new order each time the patient is returned to bed after being out of bed. 
 
• Repetitive self -mutilating behavior .  If a patient is diagnosed with a chronic 
medical or psychiatric condition, such as Lesch-Nyham Syndrome, and the patient 
engages in repetitive self -mutilating behavior, a standing or PRN order for restraint 
to be applied in accordance with specific parameters established in the treatment plan would be permitted.  Since the use of restraints to prevent self-injury is needed for these types of rare, severe, medical and psychiatric conditions, the specific requirements (1 -hour face- to-face evaluation, time -limited orders, and evaluation 
every 24 hours before renewal of the order) for the management of violent or self- destructive behavior do not apply.   
 Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(6)   
 
Review a random sample of medical records for patients that have been restrained or 
secluded. Review orders, progress notes, flow sheets, and nursing notes to:  
 
• Verify that there is a physician or other LIP order for each episode of restraint or 
seclusion;  
 
• Evaluate patterns of use and verify that orders were obtained when necessary;  
 • Verify that the documentation specifically addresses the patients’ behaviors or 
symptoms; and,  
 
• Determine if restraint or seclusion is being improperly implemented on a PRN basis.

§482.13(e)(7) -  The attending physician must be consulted as soon as possible if the 
attending physician did not order the restraint or seclusion.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(7)  
 The attending physician is the MD/DO who is responsible for the management and care of the patient.  Hospital medical staff policies determine who is considered the attending physician.  The intent of this requirement is to ensure that the physician who ha s overall 
responsibility and authority for the management and care of the patient is aware of the patient’s condition and is aware of the restraint or seclusion intervention.  It is important to consult with the attending physician to promote continuity of  care, to ensure patient safety, 
and to elicit information that might be relevant in choosing the most appropriate intervention for the patient.  The attending physician may have information regarding the patient’s history that may have a significant impac t on the selection of a restraint or 
seclusion intervention or an alternative intervention, and the subsequent course of treatment.  Therefore, consultation should occur as soon as possible.  Hospital policies and procedures should address the definition of “as soon as possible” based on the needs of their particular patient population(s).  However, any established time frames must be consistent with “as soon as possible.”    The hospital CoPs do permit the patient to be under the care of a treating LIP other than a physician.  Section 482.12(c)(1) requires every Medicare patient to be under the care of  
a doctor of medicine  or osteopathy; or, within the scope of their respective licenses, a 
doctor of dental surgery or dental medicine, a doctor of podiatry, chiropractor, or clinical psychologist.  The individual overseeing the patient’s care may be the attending physician 
or a health professional practicing with the delegated authority or supervision of a doctor of medicine or osteopathy as permitted by State law and hospital policy.    When the attending physician of record is unavailable, responsibility for the patient must be delegated to another physician, who would then be considered the attending physician.    This provision does not specify that consultation with the attending physician be face -to-
face. The consultation can occur via telephone.   
 Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(7)  
 
• Review the patient’s medical record for documentation that the attending physician was 
notified immediately if the attending physician did not order the restraint or seclusion.   Was the attending physician notified “as soon as possible?”  
 
• Review the hospital’s policies and procedures regarding consultation with the attending 
physician if the attending physician did not order the restraint or seclusion.  
 
• Interview staff to determine if actual practice is consistent with written hospital policies 
and procedures.

§482.13(e) (8) - Unless superseded by State law that is more restrictive --  
 
(i) Each order for restraint or seclusion used for the management of violent or self -
destructive behavior that jeopardizes the immediate physical safety of the patient, a staff member, or others may only be renewed in accordance with the following limits for up to a total of 24 hours:  
 
(A)   4 hours for adults 18 years of age or older;  
(B)   2 hours for children and adolescents 9 to 17 years of age; or  
(C)   1 hour for children under 9 years of age; and  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(8)(i)   
Patients of all ages are vulnerable and at risk when restrained or secluded to manage violent or self -destructive behavior.  Therefore, time limits have been established for each order for 
restraint or seclusion used to manage violent or self -destructive b ehavior.  State law may 
require more restrictive time limits. These time limits do not  apply to orders for restraint 
used to manage non- violent or non- self-destructive behavior.  However, the requirement 
that restraint use be ended at the earliest possible  time applies to all uses of restraint.  
 In the final rule on the use of restraint or seclusion, CMS did not include specific criteria for differentiating between emergency situations where the patient’s behavior is violent or self -
destructive and jeopardizes the immediate physical safety of the patient, a staff member, or others, and non- emergency use of restraint.  Clinicians are adept at identifying various 
behaviors and symptoms, and can readily recognize violent and self -destructive behavior 
that jeopardizes the immediate physical safety of t he patient, a staff member, or others.  
Asking clinicians to act based on an evaluation of the patient’s behavior is no different than relying on the clinical judgment that they use daily in assessing the needs of each patient and taking actions to meet those individual needs.  The regulation identifies maximum  time limits on the length of each order for restraint or 
seclusion based on age.  The physician or other LIP has the discretion to write the order for a shorter length of time.  The length- of-order requirement identifies critical points at which 
there is mandatory contact with a physician or other LIP responsible for the care of the patient.  In addition, the time limits do not dictate how long a patient should remain in restraint or seclusion.  Staff is expected to continu ally assess and monitor the patient to 
ensure that the patient is released from restraint or seclusion at the earliest possible time.  Restraint or seclusion may only be employed while the unsafe situation continues.  Once the unsafe situation ends, the us e of restraint or seclusion should be discontinued.  The 
regulation explicitly states that the intervention must be discontinued at the earliest possible time, regardless of the length of time identified in the order.  For example, if a patient’s behavior is no longer violent or self -destructive 20 minutes after the intervention is 
initiated, then the restraint or seclusion should be discontinued, even if the order was given for up to 4 hours.  If restraint or seclusion is discontinued prior to the expirati on of the 
original order, a new order must be obtained prior to reinitiating the use of restraint or seclusion.   
 
At the end of the time frame, if the continued use of restraint or seclusion to manage violent 
or self -destructive behavior is deemed necessary based on an individualized patient 
assessment, another order is required.  When the original order is about to expire, an RN must contact the physician or other LIP, report the results of his or her most recent assessment and request that the original order be renewed (not to exceed the time limits established in the regulation).  Whether or not an onsite assessment is necessary prior to renewing the order is left to the discretion of the physician or other LIP in conjunction with a discussion with the RN who is over-seeing the care of the patient.  Another 1- hour face -
to-face patient evaluation (see 
§482.13(e)(12 ) and the related interpretive guidance) is not 
required when the original order is renewed.   
 The original restraint or seclusion order may only be renewed within the required time limits for up to a total of 24 hours.  After the original order expires, a physician or other LIP must see and assess the patient before issuing a new order.    EXCEPTION:  Repetitive self -mutilating behaviors – see interpretive guidance for 
§482.13(e)(6). 
 Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(8)(i)  
 
• When restraint or seclusion is used to manage violent or self-destructive behavior, do orders contain the appropriate time frames based on the patient’s age?  Does the total number of hours covered by an order or its renewal exceed 24 hours? 
 
• If more restrictive State laws apply, are they being followed?  
 
• Is the renewal order for restraint or seclusion based on a comprehensive individual 
patient assessment?  
 
• Is there evidence in the patient’s medical record that the symptoms necessitating the

§482.13(e)(8)(ii) - After 24 hours, before writing a new order for the use of restraint or seclusion for the management of violent or self -destructive behavior, a physician or 
other licensed practitioner who is responsible for the care of the patient and authorized to order restraint or seclusion by hospital policy in accordance with State law must see and assess the patient..  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(8)(ii)  
 At a minimum, if a patient remains in restraint or seclusion for the management of violent or self -destructive behavior 24 hours after the original order, the physician or other LP must 
see the patient and conduct a face- to-face re- evaluation before writin g a new order for the 
continued use of restraint or seclusion.  Twenty-four hours of restraint or seclusion for the management of violent or self- destructive behavior is an extreme measure with the potential 
for serious harm to the patient.   State laws may be more restrictive and require the physician or other LP to conduct a face -
to-face re -evaluation within a shorter timeframe.  
  
When the physician or other LP renews an order or writes a new order authorizing the 
continued use of restraint or seclusion, there must be documentation in the patient’s medical record that describes the findings of the physician's or other LPs re- evaluat ion supporting 
the continued use of restraint or seclusion.  EXCEPTION:   Repetitive self -mutilating behaviors – see interpretive guidance for 
§482.13(e)(6).
 
 Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(8)((ii)  
• If restraint or seclusion is used to manage violent or self-destructive behavior for longer than 24 hours, is there documentation of a new written order, patient assessments, and a re-evaluation by a physician or other LP in the medical record?  Does the d ocumentation provide sufficient evidence to support the need to continue 
the use of restraint or seclusion?  Is there evidence in the medical record that the symptoms necessitating the continued use of restraint or seclusion have persisted?

 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(9)  
 
Restraint or seclusion may only be employed while the unsafe situation continues.  Once 
the unsafe situation ends, the use of restraint or seclusion must be discontinued.   
 
Staff members are expected to assess and monitor the patient’s condition on an ongoing basis to determine whether restraint or seclusion can safely be discontinued.  The regulation requires that these interventions be ended as quickly as possible.  However , the decision to 
discontinue the intervention should be based on the determination that the patient’s behavior is no longer a threat to self, staff members, or others.  When the physician or LIP renews an order or writes a new order authorizing the continued use of restraint or seclusion, there must be documentation in the medical record that describes the patient’s clinical needs and supports the continued use of restraint or seclusion.  The hospital policies and procedures should address, at a minimum:  
 
• Categories of staff that the hospital authorizes to discontinue restraint or seclusion in accordance with State law; and  
 
• The circumstances under which restraint or seclusion is to be discontinued. 
 Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(9)  
 
• Does the hospital have policies and procedures for ending restraint or seclusion?  Do the policies include a requirement to end the restraint or seclusion as soon as is safely possible?  
 
• Does the medical record contain evidence that the decision to continue or discontinue the use of restraint or seclusion was based on an assessment and re -
evaluation of the patient’s condition?  
 
• Interview staff to determine whether they are aware that use of a restraint or 
seclusion must be discontinued as soon as is safely possible.

 §482.13(e)(10) -  The condition of the patient who is restrained or secluded must be 
monitored by a physician, other licensed  practitioner or trained staff that have completed the training criteria specified in paragraph (f) of this section at an interval determined by hospital policy.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(10)  
 Ongoing assessment and monitoring of the patient 's condition by a physician, other LP or 
trained staff is crucial for prevention of patient  injury or death, as well as ensuring that the 
use of restraint or seclusion is discontinued at the earliest possible time.  Hospital policies are expected to guide staff in determining appropriate intervals for assessment and monitoring based on the individual needs of the patient , the patient 's condition, and the type 
of restraint or seclusion used.  The selection of an intervention and determination of the necessar y frequency of assessment and monitoring should be individualized, taking into 
consideration variables such as the patient’s condition, cognitive status, risks associated with the use of the chosen intervention, and other relevant factors.  In some cases, checks every 15 minutes or vital signs taken every 2 hours may not be sufficient to ensure the patient’s safety.  In others, it may be excessive or disruptive to patient care (e.g., it may be unnecessary to mandate that a patient with wrist restraints, and who is asleep, be checked every 15 minutes and awakened every 2 hours to take the patient’s vital signs).  Similarly, 
depending on the patient’s needs and situational factors, the use of restraint or seclusion 
may require either periodic (e.g., every 15 minutes, every 30 minutes, etc.) or continual 
(i.e., moment to moment) monitoring and assessment.  
 Hospital policies should address:  frequencies of monitoring and assessment; assessment content (e.g., vital signs, circulation, hydration needs, elimination needs, level of distress and agitation, mental status, cognitive functioning, skin integrity, etc.); providing for nutritional needs, range of motion exercises, and elimination needs; and mental status and neurological evaluations.  With the exception of the simultaneous use of restraint and seclusion, one- to-one 
observation with a staff member in constant attendance is not required by this regulation unless deemed necessary based on a practitioner’s clinical judgment.  For example, placing staff at the bedside of a patient  with wrist restraints may be unnecessary.  However, for a 
more restrictive or risky intervention and/or a patient  who is suicidal, self injurious, or 
combative, staff may determine that continual face -to-face monito ring is needed.  The 
hospital is responsible for providing the level of monitoring and frequency of reassessment that will protect the patient 's safety.  
  Hospitals have flexibility in determining which staff performs the patient assessment and monitoring.  This determination must be in accordance with the practitioner’s scope of clinical practice and State law.  For example, assessment and monitoring are activities within a registered nurse’s scope of practice.  However, some trained, unlicensed staff may perform components of monitoring (e.g., checking the patient's vital signs, hydration and circulation; the patient’s level of distress and agitation; or sk in integrity), and may also 
provide for general care needs (e.g., eating, hydration, toileting, and range of motion exercises).  Section  482.13(f)
 requires that before applying restraints, implementing 
seclusion, or performing associated monitoring and care tasks, staff must be trained and able to demonstrate competency in the performance of these actions.  
 Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(10)  
• Review hospital policies r egarding assessment and monitoring of a patient in 
restraint or seclusion. 
 
o What evidence do you find that the hospital’s monitoring policies are put into practice for all restrained or secluded patients?  
 
o Do hospital policies identify which categories of staff are responsible for assessing and monitoring the patient? 
 o Do hospital policies include time frames for offering fluids and nourishment, toileting/elimination, range of motion, exercise of limbs and systematic release of restrained limbs?  Is this documented in the patient’s medical record?  
 
• Review patient medical records:  
 
o Was there a valid rationale for the decision regarding the frequency of patient assessment and monitoring documented in the medical record? 
 
o Was documentation consistent, relevant, and reflective of the patient’s condition? 
 
o Are time frames described for how often a patient is monitored for vital signs, respiratory and cardiac status, and skin integrity checks? 
 
o Is there documentation of ongoing patient monitoring and assessment (e.g., skin 
integrity, circulation, respiration, intake and output, hygiene, injury, etc)?  
 
o Is the patient’s mental status assessed?  Is this documented in the medical 
record?  
 
o Is the patient assessed regarding continued need for the use of seclusion or restraint?   
o Is there adequate justification for continued use and is this documented?  
o Is the level of supervision appropriate to meet the safety needs of the patient who is at a higher risk for injury (e.g., self -injurious, suicidal)?

 §482.13(e)(11) -  Physician and other licensed practitioner training requirements must 
be specified in hospital policy.  At a minimum, physicians and other licensed practitioners authorized to order restraint or seclusion by hospital policy in 
accordance wi th State law must have a working knowledge of hospital policy 
regarding the use of restraint or seclusion.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(11)  
 At a minimum, physicians and other LPs authorized to order restraint and seclusion must have a working knowledge of hospital policy regarding the use of restraint and seclusion.  
 Hospitals have the flexibility to identify training requirements above this minimum requirement based on the competency level of their physicians and other LPs, and the needs of the patient population(s) that they serve.  Physicians receive training in the  assessment, 
monitoring, and evaluation of a patient’s condition as part of their medical school education.  However, physicians generally do not receive training regarding application of restraint or implementation of seclusion as part of their basic educ ation.  Depending on the 
level and frequency of involvement that a physician or other LP has in the performance of these activities, additional training may or may not be necessary to ensure the competency of these individuals in this area.  The hospital i s in the best position to determine if 
additional physician or other LP training is necessary based on the model of care, level of physician competency, and the needs of the patient population(s) that the hospital serves.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(11)  
 
• Review the hospital policy regarding restraint and seclusion training requirements for physicians and other LPs.  Are the minimum training requirements addressed?  
 
• Review medical staff credentialing and privileging files to determine if physicians or other LPs involved in restraint and seclusion activities have completed the required training.

 §482.13(e)(12) -  When restraint or seclusion is used for the management of violent or 
self-destructive behavior that jeopardizes the immediate physical safety of the patient, 
a staff member, or others, the patient must be seen face -to-face within 1 hour af ter the 
initiation of the intervention --   
(i) By a –  
(A)  Physician or other licensed practitioner; or  
(B) Registered nurse who has been trained in accordance with the 
requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(12)(i)  
 When restraint or seclusion is used to manage violent or self -destructive behavior, a 
physician or other LP, or a registered nurse (RN) trained in accordance with the requirements specified under §482.13(f), must see the patient face -to-face within 1 -hour 
after the initiation of the intervention. This requirement also applies when a drug or medication is used as a restraint to manage violent or self -destructive behavior. 
  The 1 -hour face -to-face patient evaluation must be conducted in person by a physician or 
other LP, or trained RN.  A telephone call or telemedicine methodology is not permitted.   If a patient’s violent or self -destructive behavior resolves and the restraint or seclusion 
intervention is discontinued before the practitioner arrives to perform the 1- hour face -to-
face evaluation, the practitioner is still required to see the patient fa ce-to-face and conduct 
the evaluation within 1 hour after the initiation of this intervention.  The fact that the patient’s behavior warranted the use of a restraint or seclusion indicates a serious medical or psychological need for prompt evaluation of the patient behavior that led to the intervention.  The evaluation would also determine whether there is a continued need for the intervention, factors that may have contributed to the violent or self -destructive 
behavior, and whether the intervention was appropriate to address the violent or self -
destructive behavior.  
 
EXCEPTION:  Repetitive self -mutilating behaviors – see interpretive guidance for 
§482.13(e)(6) .

(A) The patient's immediate situation;  
(B) The patient's reaction to the intervention;  
(C) The patient's medical and behavioral condition; and 
  (D) The need to continue or terminate the restraint or seclusion.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(12)(ii)  
 The 1 -hour face -to-face evaluation includes both a physical and behavioral assessment of 
the patient that must be conducted by a qualified practitioner within the scope of their practice.  An evaluation of the patient’s medical condition would include a complete review 
of systems assessment, behavioral assessment, as well as review and assessment of the 
patient’s history, drugs and medications, most recent lab results, etc.  The purpose is to 
complete a comprehensive review of the patient’s condition to determine if othe r factors, 
such as drug or medication interactions, electrolyte imbalances, hypoxia, sepsis, etc., are contributing to the patient’s violent or self -destructive behavior.  
 Training for an RN or PA to conduct the 1- hour face -to-face evaluation would include all of 
the training requirements at §482.13(f) as well as content to evaluate the patient's immediate situation, the patient's reaction to the intervention, the patient's medical and 
behavioral condition (documented training in conducting physical and behavioral 
assessment); and the need to continue or terminate the restraint or seclusion. 
 
Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(12)(ii):  
 
• Was the 1 -hour face -to-face evaluation conducted by a practitioner authorized by 
hospital policy in accordance with State law to conduct this evaluation?  
 
• If the 1 -hour face -to-face evaluations are conducted by RNs who are not advanced 
practice nurses (APN), verify that those RNs have documented training that demonstrates they are qualified to conduct a physical and behavioral assessment of the patient that addresses:  the patient’s immediate situation, the patient’s reaction to the intervention, the patient’s medical and behavioral condition, and the need to continue or terminate the restraint or seclusion. 
 
• Does documentation of the 1- hour face -to-face evaluation in the patient’s medical 
record include all the listed elements of this requirement?  
 
• Did the evaluation indicate whether changes in the patient’s care were required, and, 
if so, were the changes made?  
 
• Is practice consistent with hospital policy and State law?

§482.13(e)(14) -  - If the face -to-face evaluation specified in paragraph (e)(12) of this 
section is conducted by a trained registered nurse, the trained registered nurse must consult the attending physician or other licensed practitioner who is responsible  for 
the care of the patient soon as possible after the completion of the 1 hour face- to-face 
evaluation.   Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(14)  
 When a trained RN conducts the required face- to-face evaluation, he or she must consult 
the attending physician or other LP responsible for the patient’s care as soon as possible after the completion of the evaluation.  Hospital policy should address the expected time frame for and the components of the consultation with the atte nding physician or other LP 
consistent with “as soon as possible.”  This consultation should include, at a minimum, a discussion of the findings of the 1- hour face -to-face evaluation, the need for other 
interventions or treatments, and the need to continue  or discontinue the use of restraint or 
seclusion.  A consultation that is not conducted prior to a renewal of the order would not be consistent with the requirement, “as soon as possible.”  
 Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(14):
 
 
• Review the relevant hospital restraint and seclusion policy. 
 
• Does the hospital policy clarify expectations regarding the requirement, “as soon as possible”?  
 
• Does documentation in the patient’s medical record indicate consultation with the 
attending physician or other LP when the 1 -hour face -to-face evaluation was 
conducted by a trained RN?  
 
• Is practice consistent with hospital policy?

(Rev. 37, Issued:  10- 17-08; Effective/Implementation Date:  10 -17-08) 
 
§482.13(e)(15) -  All requirements specified under this paragraph are applicable to the 
simultaneous use of restraint and seclusion.  Simultaneous restraint and seclusion use is only permitted if the patient is continually monitored –  
(i) Face- to-face by an assigned, trained staff member; or  
(ii) By trained staff using both video and audio equipment.  This monitoring must be in close proximity to the patient.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(e)(15)  
 When the simultaneous use of restraint and seclusion is employed, there must be adequate documentation that justifies the decision for simultaneous use as well as vigilance in continuously monitoring the patient so that the patient’s care needs are met.   All requirements specified under standard (e) apply to the simultaneous use of restraint and seclusion.  The simultaneous use of restraint and seclusion is not permitted unless the patient  is continually monitored by trained staff, either through face -to-face observation or 
through the use of both video and audio equipment.  Monitoring with video and audio 
equipment further requires that staff perform the monitoring in close proximity to the 
patient .  For the purposes of this requirement, “continually” means ongoing without 
interruption.  The use of video and audio equipment does not eliminate the need for frequent monitoring and assessment of the patient.   
 An individual who is physically restrained alone in his or her room is not necessarily being simultaneously secluded.  The individual’s privacy and dignity should be protected to the extent possible during any intervention.  In fact, the purpose of restraining a patient alone in his or her room may be to promote privacy and dignity versus simultaneously using seclusion and restraint.  While this distinction may be difficult to make, it is helpful to consider whether the patient would, in the absence of the physical restraint, be able to voluntarily leave the room.  If so, then the patient is not also being secluded.  However, if the physical restraint was removed and the patient was still unable to leave the room because the door was locked or staff were oth erwise physically preventing the patient from 
doing so, then the patient is also being secluded.  Staff must take extra care to protect the safety of the patient when interventions that are more restrictive are used.  Monitoring must be appropriate to the intervention chosen, so that the patient is protected from possible abuse, assault, or self injury during the intervention.  Survey Procedures §482.13(e)(15):  
• Review the hospital’s policy regarding simultaneous use of restraint and seclusion to determine whether it provides for continual monitoring and otherwise complies with all requirements of §482.13
.  
 
• Conduct document review and staff interviews to determine if practice is consistent with the hospital policy and required uninterrupted audio and visual monitoring is provided as required. 
 
• Is the staff member monitoring the patient with video and audio equipment trained and in close proximity to ensure prompt emergency intervention if a problem arises? 
 
• Does the video equipment cover all areas of the room or location where the patient is restrained or secluded?  
 
• Is the audio and video equipment located in an area that assures patient privacy? 
 
• Is the equipment appropriately maintained and in working condition?

 The use of restraint or seclusion must be selected only when less restrictive measures have been judged to be ineffective to protect the patient or others from harm.  It is not always appropriate for less restrictive alternatives to be attempted prior to the use of restraint or seclusion.  When a patient’s behavior presents an immediate and serious danger to his - or 
herself, or others, immediate action is needed.  For example, when a patient physically attacks someone, immediate action is needed.  While staff should be mindful of using the least intrusive intervention, it is critical that the intervention selected be effective in protecting the patient or others from harm.

All staff designated by the hospital as having direct patient care responsibilities, including contract or agency personnel, must demonstrate the competencies specified in standard (f) prior to participating in the application of restraints, implementation of seclusion, monitoring, a ssessment, or care of a patient in restraint or seclusion.  These competencies 
must be demonstrated initially as part of orientation and subsequently on a periodic basis consistent with hospital policy.  Hospitals have the flexibility to identify a time fr ame for 
ongoing training based on the level of staff competency, and the needs of the patient population(s) served.  Training for an RN or PA to conduct the 1- hour face -to-face evaluation would include all of 
the training requirements at §482.13(f)
 as well as content to evaluate the patient's 
immediate situation, the patient's reaction to the intervention, the patient's medical and behavioral condition, and the need to continue or terminate the restraint or seclusion.

Once initial training takes place, training must be provided frequently enough to ensure that 
staff possesses the requisite knowledge and skills to safely care for restrained or secluded patients in accordance with the regulations.  The results of skills and knowledge assessments, new equipment, or QAPI data may indicate a need for targeted training or more frequent or revised training.    Hospitals are required to have appropriately trained staff for the proper and safe use of seclusion and restraint interventions. It would not be appropriate for a hospital to routinely call upon a law enforcement agency or agencies as a means of applying restraint or initiating seclusion.  If hospital security guards, or other non- healthcare staff, as part of 
hospital policy, may assist direct care staff, when requested, in the application of restraint or seclusion, the security guards, or other non-healthc are staff, are also expected to be trained

§482.13(f)(2)  Training Content. - The hospital must require appropriate staff to have 
education, training, and demonstrated knowledge based on the specific needs of the patient population in at least the following:  
 
(i) Techniques to identify staff and patient behaviors, events, and environmental factors that may trigger circumstances that require the use of a restraint or seclusion.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(f)(2)(i)  
 The term “appropriate staff” includes all staff that apply restraint or seclusion, monitor, assess, or otherwise provide care for patients in restraint or seclusion.  All staff, including contract or agency personnel, designated by the hospital as having direct patient care responsibilities are required to receive training in the areas of clinical techniques used to identify patient and staff behaviors, events and envir onmental factors 
that may trigger circumstances that require the use of restraint or seclusion.  This training should be targeted to the specific needs of the patient populations being served, and to the competency level of staff.   
 
Staff needs to be able to employ a broad range of clinical interventions to maintain the 
safety of the patient and others.  The hospital is expected to provide education and training at the appropriate level to the appropriate staff based upon the specific needs of the patient population being served.  For example, staff routinely providing care for patients who exhibit violent or self-destructive behavior that jeopardizes the immediate physical safety of the patient, a staff member, or others (such as in an emergency department or on a psychiatric unit) generally require more in-depth training in the areas included in the regulation than staff routinely providing medical/surgical care.  Hospitals may develop and implement their own training programs or use an outside training program.  However, standard (f) specifies that individuals providing staff training must be qualified as evidenced by education, training, and experience.  Hospitals have the flexibility to develop their own training program to meet the staff training requirements at §482.13(f)
 or purchase a training program from the outside.  CMS 
does not specify that any particular outside vendor must be used to provide the required training.  Each hospital must assess the learning needs and competency of their staff to determine how extensive periodic training and staff competency demonstration must be subsequent to initial training.  The training program must be provided to all appropriate staff.  Any person monitoring or providing care to a restrained patient must demonstrate the knowledge and abilities required by the regulations. 
 At a minimum, physicians and other LIPs authorized to order restraint or seclusion by hospital policy in accordance with State law must have a working knowledge of hospital policy regarding the use of restraint and seclusion. Hospitals have the flexibility to identify training requirements above this minimum based on the competency level of their physicians and other LIPs and the needs of the patient population that they serve.    Survey Procedures §482.13(f)(2)(i):  
• Does the hospital educational program include techniques related to the specific patient populations being served? 
 
• Does the hospital educational program include techniques to identify staff and patient behaviors, events, and environmental factors that may trigger circumstances that require the use of restraint or seclusion? 
 
• Does the hospital educational program provide more in-depth training in the areas included in the regulation for staff members who routinely provide care to patients who exhibit violent or self-destructive behavior (e.g., staff who work in the emergency department or psychiatric unit)?  
• Interview staff to assess their knowledge of the restraint and seclusion techniques addressed in this requirement.

§482.13(f)(2)(ii) - The use of nonphysical intervention skills.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(f)(2)(ii)  
 
Although we recognize that there may be circumstances in which the use of restraint or 
seclusion may be necessary to prevent a patient situation from escalating, staff often skillfully intervene with alternative techniques to redirect a patient, engage the  patient in 
constructive discussion or activity, or otherwise help the patient maintain self-control and avert escalation.  
 The use of nonphysical intervention skills does not mean attempting a complex series of interventions or a lengthy checklist of steps to initiate before restraining or secluding a patient.  Rather, a whole toolbox of possible interventions can be implemented during the course of a patient’s treatment based upon the assessment of an individual patient’s responses.    Survey Procedures §482.13(f)(2)(ii)  
• Does the hospital educational program address the use of nonphysical intervention skills?

§482.13(f)(2)(iii) - Choosing the least restrictive intervention based on an individualized assessment of the patient's medical, or behavioral status or condition.  Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(f)(2)(iii)  
 
The underpinning of this regulation is the concept that safe patient care hinges on looking at the patient as an individual and assessing the patient’s condition, needs, strengths, weaknesses, and preferences.  Such an approach relies on caregivers who are skilled in individualized assessment and in tailoring interventions to individual patient’s needs after weighing factors such as the patient’s condition, behaviors, history, and environmental factors.   
 Resources are available to assist clinicians in identifying less restrictive interventions.  For example, the American Psychiatric Association (APA), American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA), and the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems  
(NAPHS), with support from the American Hospital Association (AHA), have sponsored the publication of a document entitled, “Learning from Each Other—Success Stories and Ideas for Reducing Restraint/Seclusion in Behavioral Health.”  This document, published in 2003, was developed through dialogue with the field and extensive input from behavioral healthcare providers throughout the country who have been working to reduce the use of restraint and seclusion, and to improve care within their facilities.

 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(f)(2)(vii)  
 
Hospitals are required to provide a safe environment for the patients in their care.  When restraint or seclusion techniques are used, patients are placed at a higher risk for injuries or even death.  Hospitals must require appropriate staff (all staff who apply restraint or 
seclusion, monitor, access or provide care for a patient in restraint or seclusion) to receive 
education and training in the use  of first aid techniques as well as training and certification 
in the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  Hospitals are not required to use any particular recognized first aid course.  Additionally, such courses may not adequately address the immediate interventions, the “first aid”, that needs to be rendered to a restrained or secluded patient who is in distr ess or injured.  The 
goal is for staff to be able to render the appropriate “first aid” required if a restrained or secluded patient is in distress or injured.  For example, a patient is found hanging in a vest restraint, a restrained patient is choking on food, a secluded suicidal patient is found hanging, a secluded suicidal patient has cut himself, etc.  Hospital staff need to assess their patient population and identify likely scenarios, develop a first aid training that addresses those scenarios, and provide that “first aid” training to all staff that care for restrained or secluded patients.

 §482.13(g)  Standard:  Death Reporting Requirements: -  Hospitals must report deaths 
associated with the use of seclusion or restraint.  
 (1)  With the exception of deaths described under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the 
hospital must report the following information to CMS by telephone, facsimile, or electronically, as determined by CMS, no later than the close of business on the next business day following knowledge of the patient’s death:   (i) Each death that occurs while a patient is in restraint or seclusion. 
 
(ii) Each death that occurs within 24 hours after the patient has been removed from 
restraint or seclusion. 
 
(iii) Each death known to the hospital that occurs within 1 week after restraint or 
seclusion where it is reasonable to assume that use of restraint or placement in seclusion contributed directly or indirectly to a patient's death, regardless of the type(s) of r estraint 
used on the patient during this time. “Reasonable to assume” in this context includes, but is not limited to, deaths related to restrictions of movement for prolonged periods of time, or 
death related to chest compression, restriction of breathing or asphyxiation….  
 
(3) The staff must document in the patient’s medical record the date and time the death 
was: 
 (i) Reported to CMS for deaths described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section; or…. 
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(g)(1) & (3)(i)  The hospital must report to its CMS Regional Office each death that occurs:   
• While a patient is in restraint or in seclusion, except when no seclusion has been used and the only restraint used was a soft,  cloth- like two -point wrist restraints;  
 
• Within 24 hours after the patient has been removed from restraint or seclusion, except when no seclusion has been used and the only restraint used was a soft, two-point wrist restraint; or,  
 
• Within 1 week after use of restraint or seclusion where the death is known to the hospital and it is reasonable to assume that the use of restraint or seclusion contributed directly or indirectly to the patient’s death, regardless of the type(s) of restrai nt used on the patient during this time.    
 
o “Reasonable to assume” applies only to those deaths that occur on days 2- 7 
after restraint or seclusion has been discontinued. 
 
o This criterion applies regardless of the type of restraint that was used on the patient.  In other words, it applies to all uses of restraint or seclusion where the patient has died on days 2- 7 after the restraint or seclusion was 
discontinued, and  it is reasonable to assume the use of the restraint or 
seclusion contributed to the patient’s death.  In a case where only two-point soft wrist restraints were used and there was no seclusion, it may reasonably be presumed that the patient’s death was not caused by the use of restraints. 
 
o In cases involving death within one week after use of restraint or seclusion where the intervention may have contributed to the patient’s death, it is possible that the patient’s death might occur outside the hospital and that the hospital might not learn of the patient’s death, or that there might be a delay in the hospital’s learning of the patient’s death.  
See the guidance for §482.13(g)(2) for handling of deaths while a patient was in, or within 24 hours after removal of a soft, two-point wrist restraint, when no other restraint or seclusion was used.  The reports required under §482.13(g)(1) must be submitted to the CMS Regional Office by telephone, facsimile , or electronically, as determined by  the Regional Office no later than 
close of the next business day following the day in which the hospital knows of the patient’s death.  The report must include basic identifying information related to the hospital, the patient’s name, date of birth, date of death, name of attending physician/practitioner, primary diagnosis(es), cause of death (preliminary, in cas e a final, 
official cause of death is not yet available), and type(s) of restraint or seclusion used.  CMS makes a standard form available for hospitals to use in submitting the required reports.  Hospitals must document in the patient’s medical record the date and time each reportable death associated with the use of restraint or seclusion was reported to the CMS Regional Office.   
 
After reviewing the submitted information, the Regional Office will determine whether an 
on-site investigation of the circumstances surrounding the patient’s death is warranted and 
will direct the State Survey Agency to conduct a survey if applicable.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.13(g)(1) & (3)(i):  
 
• Does the hospital have restraint/seclusion death reporting policies and procedures that address responsibilities and systems for identifying restraint/seclusion-associated deaths reportable to CMS and for implementing the reporting and recordkeeping requir ements?  
 
• Can the hospital provide examples of restraint/seclusion- associated deaths that were 
reported to CMS?   
 
o If yes, review the report and medical records to determine whether:  
 
• the reports met the criteria for reporting to CMS;  
• were submitted timely to CMS;  
• were complete; and  
• the date and time the death reported to CMS was entered into the patient’s medical record.  
 
o If no:  
 
• Ask the hospital how it ensures that there were no reportable restraint/seclusion -associated deaths.  
 • If the hospital’s system relies upon staff identification of reportable deaths, interview several applicable staff members to determine whether they are aware of the hospital’s policy and know when and where to report internally a restraint/seclusion -associated death.  Ask 
if there have been any patient deaths that meet the reporting requirements.  
 
• Interview staff in various types of inpatient units, including a psychiatric unit if applicable, to determine whether they are aware of any patients who died while in restraints or seclusion or within one day of restraint or seclusion discontinuation, excluding cases involving only the use of two- point soft wrist restraints and no 
seclusion.  If yes, check whether the hospital has any evidence that these cases were reported to CMS.

deaths associated with the use of seclusion or restraint.]  
 (2) When no seclusion has been used and when the only restraints used on the 
patient are those applied exclusively to the patient’s wrist(s), and which are composed solely of soft, non -rigid, cloth -like materials, the hospital staff must record in an 
internal log or other system, the following information:  
 (i) Any death that occurs while a patient is in such restraints.  
 
(ii)  Any death that occurs within 24 hours after a patient has been removed from 
such restraints.  
 
(3) The staff must document in the patient’s medical record the date and time the 
death was:  
 
(ii) Recorded in the internal log or other system for deaths described in 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section. 
 (4) For deaths described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, entries into the log or 
other system must be documented as follows:  
 (i) Each entry must be made not later than seven days after the date of death of the 
patient.  
 
(ii) Each entry must document the patient’s name, date of birth, date of death, name 
of attending physician or other licensed practitioner who is responsible for the care of the patient medical record number, and primary diagnosis(es).  
  (iii) The information must be made available in either written or electronic form to 
CMS immediately upon request.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(g)(2), (3)(ii), & (4)  
 Hospitals must maintain an internal log or other type of tracking system for recording information on each death that occurs:  
 
• While a patient is in only 2 -point soft, cloth- like non- rigid wrist restraints and there 
is no use of seclusion; and 
 
• Within 24 hours of the patient being removed from 2- point soft, cloth- like non- rigid 
wrist restraints where there was no use of any other type of restraint or seclusion.  
 
Use of the log or tracking system is limited only to patient deaths meeting one of these two criteria.  Examples of patient deaths associated with restraints that must still be reported to CMS include:  
• Deaths occurring during or within 24 hours of discontinuation of 2- point soft, cloth-
like non- rigid wrist restraints used in combination with any other restraint device or 
with seclusion; or  
 
• Deaths associated with the use of other types of wrist restraints, such as 2- point rigid 
or leather wrist restraints.  
 
These cases would not be included in this internal log or tracking system and would require reporting the death to CMS using telephone, fax, or electronically.  The two -point soft wrist restraint death report must be entered into the internal log or 
tracking system within 7 days of the patient’s death.  The death report log or tracking system entry must include:   
• The patient’s name;  
• Patient’s date of birth;  
• Patient’s date of death;  
• Name of the attending physician or other licensed practitioner who is responsible for 
the care or the patient;  
• Patient’s medical record number; and  
• Primary diagnosis(es).  
 
Depending on the size and nature of the patient population the hospital serves and the types 
of services it provides, there will likely be variations in the frequency of restraint use as 
well as in the incidence of patient deaths.  Surveyors should adjust their expectations for the 
volume of log or tracking system entries accordingly.  For example, hospitals with intensive 
care units might be more likely to use both soft, 2- point wrist res traints and to have 
seriously ill patients who die as a result of their disease while such restraints are being used or within 24 hours after their discontinuance.  On the other hand, a rehabilitation hospital would be expected to use such restraints less frequently, and to have patients who die less frequently while hospitalized.  
 The log or tracking system must be available in written, i.e., hard copy, or electronic form immediately upon CMS’s request.  CMS will specify the form in which the information is to be provided.   Generally CMS would request access to the log or tracking system during an on- site survey by CMS staff or State surveyors acting on CMS’s behalf when assessing 
compliance with restraint/seclusion requirements.  However, CMS may also request that a copy of portions or the entire log or tracking system be provided, even though no survey is in progress.  Accreditation organizations conducting hospital inspections in accordance with a CMS -approved Medicare hospital accreditation program are also entitled to immediate 
access to the log or tracking system. The hospital is not required to make the contents of the log or tracking system available to any other outside parties, unless required to do so under other Federal or State law.  
 The hospital must document in the patient’s medical record the date and time the death report entry was made into the log or tracking system.  Survey Procedures §482.13(g)(2), (3)(ii), & (4)  
 
• Does the hospital have restraint/seclusion death reporting policies and procedures that address responsibilities and systems for identifying restraint/seclusion-associated deaths that must be recorded in an internal hospital log/tracking system, and for im plementing the reporting and recordkeeping requirements?  
 
• Ask the hospital how it ensures that each death that must be captured in the log/tracking system is identified and entered.  
 
• Interview inpatient unit staff to determine whether they have had patients who die while 2 -point soft wrist restraints are being used without seclusion or within 24 
hours of their discontinuance.  If yes, ask the hospital to demonstrate that it has recorded such deaths.
 
 
• If the hospital’s log or tracking system relies upon staff identification of reportable deaths, interview several applicable staff members to determine whether they are aware of the hospital’s policy and know when and where to report internally a restraint /seclusion -associated death.   
• Review the log/tracking system for patient deaths associated with use of only 2-point soft wrist restraints to determine if:
 
 
• Each entry was made within 7 days of the patient’s death; and  
 • Each entry contains all the information required under the regulation. 
 
•  Is the hospital able to make the log or tracking system available immediately on 
request?  
 
• Review a sample of medical records of patients whose deaths were entered in the log or tracking system.
 
Does the medical record indicate that only soft, 2- point wrist restraints were used?  
 
• Is there documentation in the medical record of the entry into the log or tracking 
system?

§482.13(h) Standard: Patient visitation rights.  A hospital must have written policies and procedures regarding the visitation rights of patients, including those setting forth any clinically necessary or reasonable restriction or limitation that the hospi tal may 
need to place on such rights and the reasons for the clinical restriction or limitation  
 Interpretive Guidelines, §482.13(h)  
 Visitation plays an important role in the care of hospital patients.  An article published in 2004 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Berwick, D.M., and Kotagal, M.:  “Restricted visiting hours in ICUs: time to change.” JAMA.  2004; Vol. 292, pp. 736- 737) 
discusses the health and safety benefits of open visitation for patients, families, and intensive care unit (ICU) staff and debunks some of the myths surrounding the issue (physiologic stress for the patient; barriers to provi sion of care; exhaustion of family and 
friends).  The article ultimately concluded that “available evidence indicates that hazards and problems
 regarding open visitation are generally overstated and manageable,” and that 
such visitation policies “do not harm patients but rather may help them by providing a 
support system and shaping a more familiar environment” as they “engender trust in families, creating a better
 working relationship between hospital staff and family members.”  
Hospitals that unnecessarily restrict patient visitation often miss an opportunity to gain valuable patient information from those who may know the patient best with respect to the patient’s medical history, conditions, medications, and allergies, particularly if the patient has difficulties with  recall or articulation, or is totally unable to recall or articulate this vital 
personal information.  Many times visitors who may know the patient best act as an intermediary for the patient, helping to communicate the patient’s needs to hospital staff.  Although visitation policies are generally considered to relate to visitors of inpatients, “visitors” also play a role for outpatients who wish to have a support person present during their outpatient visit.  For example, a same -day surgery patient may wish to have a support 
person present during the pre -operative patient preparation or post -operative recovery.  Or 
an outpatient clinic patient may wish to have a support person present during his or her 
examination by a physician.  Accordingly, hospital visitation policies must address both the inpatient and outpatient settings.  Hospitals are required to develop and implement written policies and procedures that 
address the patient’s right to have visitors.  If the hospital’s policy establishes restrictions or 
limitations on visitation, such restrictions/limitations must be clinic ally necessary or 
reasonable.  Furthermore, the hospital’s policy must include the reasons for any 
restrictions/limitations.  The right of a patient to have visitors may be limited or restricted when visitation would interfere with the care of the patient and/or the care of other patients.  
The regulation permits hospitals some flexibility, so that health care professionals may 
exercise their best clinical judgment when determining when visitation is, and is not, 
appropriate.  Best clinical judgment takes i nto account all aspects of patient health and 
safety, including the benefits of visitation on a patient’s care as well as potential negative impacts that visitors may have on other patients in the hospital.  
 
Broad examples of circumstances reasonably related to the care of the patient and/or the care of other patients that could provide a basis for a hospital to impose restrictions or limitations on visitors might include (but are not limited to) when:   
• there may be infection control issues;  
• visitation may interfere with the care of other patients;   
• the hospital is aware that there is an existing court order restricting contact;  
• visitors engage in disruptive, threatening, or violent behavior of any kind;  
• the patient or patient’s roommate(s) need rest or privacy;  
• in the case of an inpatient substance abuse treatment program, there are protocols 
limiting visitation; and  
• the patient is undergoing care interventions.  However, while there may be valid reasons 
for limiting visitation during a care intervention, we encourage hospitals to try to 
accommodate the needs of any patient who requests that at least one visitor be all owed 
to remain in the room to provide support and comfort at such times.  
 
It may also be reasonable to limit the number of visitors for any one patient during a specific period of time, as well as to establish minimum age requirements for child visitors.  However, when a hospital adopts policies that limit or restrict patients’ visitation rights, the burden of proof is upon the hospital to demonstrate that the visitation restriction is reasonably necessary to provide safe care.  
 Hospitals are expected to provide a clear explanation in their written policy of the clinical rationale for any visitation restrictions or limitations reflected in that policy.  Hospitals are not required, however, to delineate each specific clinical reaso n for policies limiting or 
restricting visitation, given that it is not possible to anticipate every instance that may give rise to a clinically appropriate rationale for a restriction or limitation.  If visitation policies differ by type of unit, e.g., se parate policies for intensive care units, or for newborn 
nurseries, the hospital policy must address the clinical rationale for this differentiation explicitly.  
 The hospital’s policies and procedures are expected to address how hospital staff who play a role in facilitating or controlling visitor access to patients will be trained to assure 
appropriate implementation of the visitation policies and procedures and a voidance of 
unnecessary restrictions or limitations on patients’ visitation rights.  
 Survey Procedures §482.13(h)  
 
• Verify that the hospital has written policies and procedures that address the right of patients to have visitors. 
 
• Review the policy to determine if there are limitations or restrictions on visitation.  If there are, does the policy explain the clinical rationale for the restrictions or limitations?  Is the rationale clear and reasonably related to clinical concerns?  
 
• Is there documentation of how the hospital identifies and trains staff who play a role in facilitating or controlling access of visitors to patients?   
 
• Are hospital staff aware of the visitation policies and procedures?  Can staff on a given unit correctly describe the hospital’s visitation policies for that unit?

 §482.13(h) Standard: Patient visitation rights.  A hospital must have written policies and procedures regarding the visitation rights of patients, including those setting forth any clinically necessary or reasonable restriction or limitation that the hospital may need to place on such rights and the reasons for the clinical restriction or limitation. A hospital must meet the following requirements:  
 
(1)  Inform each patient (or support person, where appropriate) of his or her 
visitation rights, including any clinical restriction or limitation on such rights, when he or she is informed of his or her other rights under this section.  
 
(2)  Inform each patient (or support person, where appropriate) of the right, 
subject to his or her consent, to receive the visitors whom he or she designates, 
including, but not limited to, a spouse, a domestic partner (including a same -sex 
domestic partn er), another family member, or a friend, and his or her right to 
withdraw or deny such consent at any time.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(h)(1)&(2)  
 Hospitals are required to inform each patient (or the patient’s support person, where appropriate) of his/her visitation rights.  A patient’s “support person” does not necessarily have to be the same person as the patient’s representative who is legally re sponsible for 
making medical decisions on the patient’s behalf.  A support person could be a family member, friend, or other individual who supports the patient during the course of the hospital stay.  Not only may the support person visit the patient, but  he or she may also 
exercise a patient’s visitation rights on behalf of the patient with respect to other visitors when the patient is unable to do so.  Hospitals must accept a patient’s designation, orally or in writing, of an individual as the patient’s support person.  
 When a patient is incapacitated or otherwise unable to communicate his or her wishes and an individual provides an advance directive designating an individual as the patient’s support person (it is not necessary for the document to use this exact term), the hospital must accept this designation, provide the required notice of the patient’s visitation rights, and allow the individual to exercise the patient’s visitation rights on the patient’s behalf.  
 When a patient is incapacitated or otherwise unable to communicate his or her wishes, there is no advance directive designating a representative on file, and no one has presented an 
advance directive designating himself or herself as the patient’s represen tative, but an 
individual asserts that he or she, as the patient’s spouse, domestic partner (including a same- sex domestic partner), parent or other family member, friend, or otherwise, is the 
patient’s support person, the hospital is expected to accept this assertion, without demanding  supporting documentation, provide the required notice of the patient’s visitation rights, and allow the individual to exercise the patient’s visitation rights on the patient’s behalf.  However, if more than one individual c laims to be the patient’s support 
person, it would not be inappropriate for the hospital to ask each individual for documentation supporting his/her claim to be the patient’s support person.  
 
• Hospitals are expected to adopt policies and procedures that facilitate expeditious and non- discriminatory resolution of disputes about whether an individual is the 
patient’s support person, given the critical role of the support person in exercising the p atient’s visitation rights.  
 
• A refusal by the hospital of an individual’s request to be treated as the patient’s support person with respect to visitation rights must be documented in the patient’s medical record, along with the specific basis for the refusal.  
 
Consistent with the patients’ rights notice requirements under the regulation at §482.13(a)(1), the required notice of the patient’s visitation rights must be provided, whenever possible, before the hospital provides or stops care.  The notice to the patie nt, or 
to the patient’s support person, where appropriate, must be in writing.  If the patient also has a representative who is different from the support person, the representative must also 
be provided information on the patient’s visitation rights, in a ddition to the support person, 
if applicable.  In the event that a patient has both a representative and a support person who 
are not the same individual, and they disagree on who should be allowed to visit the patient, the hospital must defer to the decis ions of the patient’s representative.  As the individual 
responsible for making decisions on the patient’s behalf, the patient’s representative has the authority to exercise a patient’s right to designate and deny visitors just as the patient would 
if he or she were capable of doing so.  The designation of, and exercise of authority by, the 
patient’s representative is governed by State law, including statutory and case law.  Many 
State courts have addressed the concept of substituted judgment, whereby the patient’s representative is expected to make medical decisions based on the patient’s values and interests, rather than the representative’s own values and interests.   State courts have also 
developed a body of closely related law around the matter of a representative acting in the patient’s best interest.  Such case law regarding substituted judgment and best interest may be a resource for hospitals on how to address such conflict situations as they establish visitation policies and procedures.  Hospitals may also choose to utilize their own social work and pastoral counseling resources to resolve such conflicts to assure the patient’s well-being.  
 The required visitation rights notice must address any clinically necessary or reasonable limitations or restrictions imposed by hospital policy on visitation rights, providing the clinical reasons for such limitations/restrictions, including how they are aimed at protecting 
the health and safety of all patients.  The information must be sufficiently detailed to allow a patient (or the patient’s support person) to determine what the visitation hours are and what restrictions, if any, apply to that patient’s  visitation rights.  
 The notice must also inform the patient (or the patient’s support person, where appropriate) of the patient’s right to:  
 
• Consent to receive visitors he or she has designated, either orally or in writing, including but not limited to, a spouse, a domestic partner (including a same -sex 
domestic partner), another family member, or a friend;  
 
• Receive the visitors he or she has designated, including but not limited to, a spouse, 
a domestic partner (including a same -sex domestic partner), another family member, 
or a friend; and  
 
• Withdraw or deny his/her consent to receive specific visitors, either orally or in 
writing.  
 The medical record must contain documentation that the required notice was provided to the patient or, if appropriate, the patient’s support person.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.13(h)(1)&(2)  
 
• Determine whether the hospital’s visitation policies and procedures require providing notice of the patient’s visitation rights to each patient or, if appropriate, to a patient’s support person and/or, as applicable, the patient’s representative. 
 
• Review the hospital’s standard notice of visitation rights.  Does it clearly explain 
the:   
• hospital’s visitation policy, including any limitations or restrictions, such as visiting hours, numbers of visitors, unit -specific restrictions, etc., and the 
clinical rationale for such limitations or restrictions?  
  
• right of the patient to have designated visitors, including but not limited to, a spouse, a domestic partner (including a same -sex domestic partner), another 
family member, or a friend, and the right to withdraw or deny consent to visitation?  
 
• Review a sample of medical records to determine if there is documentation that the 
required notice was provided. 
 
• Ask the hospital to identify how the required notice is provided.  Ask staff 
responsible for providing the notice how they accomplish this.  Ask the staff if they 
are familiar with the concept of a patient’s “support person” and what it means.  
 
• Ask a sample of current hospital patients or patients’ support persons (where 
appropriate) whether they were provided notice of their right to have visitors.  Ask if 
they were able to have visitors when they wanted to.  If not, verify whether the 
restriction/limitation on visitors was addressed in the hospital’s visitation policies and notice, and does not violate the regulations at §482.13(h)(3)&(4).   (See 
interpretive guidelines for the latter provisions.)  
 
• Ask a sample of current hospital patients or patients’ support persons (where appropriate) whether the hospital did not limit some or all visitors, contrary to the patient’s wishes.

 §482.13(h) Standard: Patient visitation rights.  A hospital must have written policies and procedures regarding the visitation rights of patients, including those setting forth 
any clinically necessary or reasonable restriction or limitation that the hospi tal may 
need to place on such rights and the reasons for the clinical restriction or limitation.  A 
hospital must meet the following requirements:  
 
(3)  Not restrict, limit, or otherwise deny visitation privileges on the basis of 
race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability.  
 (4)  Ensure that all visitors enjoy full and equal visitation privileges consistent 
with patient preferences.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.13(h)(3)&(4)  
 The hospital’s visitation policies and procedures may not use the race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability of either the patient (or the patient’s support person ore representative, where appropriate) or the patient’s visitors (including individuals seeking to visit the patient) as a basis for limiting, restricting, or otherwise denying visitation privileges.  The hospital’s policies and procedures must ensure that all visitors (including individuals seeking to visit the patient) enjoy full and equal visitation privileges, consistent with the 
preferences the patient (or, where appropriate, the patient’s support pers on) has expressed 
concerning visitors.  In other words, it is permissible for the patient (or the patient’s support person, where appropriate) to limit the visiting privileges of his/her visitors, including providing for more limited visiting privileges for some visitors than those for others.  But it is not permissible for the hospital, on its own, to differentiate among visitors without any clinically necessary or reasonable basis.  This includes visitors designated by the patient who have characteristics  not addressed specifically in §482.13(h)(3), when those 
characteristics do not reasonably relate to a clinically reasonable basis for limiting or denying visitation.  For example, it would not be appropriate to prohibit a designated visitor based on that individual’s style of dress, unless there was a clinically reasonable basis for doing so.  
The hospital is responsible for ensuring that hospital staff treat all individuals seeking to visit patients equally, consistent with the preferences of the patient (or, where appropriate, the patient’s support person) and do not use the race, color, national origin, religion, sex, 
gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability of either the patient(or the patient’s support 
person or representative, where appropriate) or the patient’s visitors (including individuals 
seeking to visit the patient) as a basis for limiting, restricting, or otherwise denying 
visitation privileges.  Hospitals are expected to educate all staff who p lay a role in 
facilitating or controlling visitors on the hospital’s visitation policies and procedures, and are responsible for ensuring that staff implement the hospital’s policies correctly.  Hospitals are urged to develop culturally competent training programs designed to address the range of patients served by the hospital. 
Survey Procedures §482.13(h)(3)&(4)  
 
• Review the hospital’s visitation policies and procedures to determine whether they restrict, limit, or otherwise deny visitation to individuals on a prohibited basis. 
 
• Ask the hospital how it educates staff to assure that visitation policies are implemented in a non- discriminatory manner.  
 
• Ask hospital staff who play a role in facilitating or controlling visitors to discuss their understanding of the circumstances under which visitors may be subject to restrictions/limitations.  Are the restrictions/limitations appropriately based on the hospital’s clinically -based policies?  
 
• Ask hospital patients (or patients’ support persons, where appropriate) whether the hospital has restricted or limited visitors against their wishes.  If yes, verify whether the restriction/limitation on visitors was addressed in the hospital’s visitation policies and in the patient notice, and whether it was appropriately based on a clinical rationale rather than impermissible discrimination.

 The hospital must have an organized medical staff that operates under bylaws approved by the governing body, and which is responsible for the quality of medical care provided to patients by the hospital.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.22  
 The hospital must have one medical staff for the entire hospital (including all campuses, provider -based locations, satellites, remote locations, etc.).  For example, a multi- campus 
hospital may not have a separately organized medical staff for each campus .  On the other 
hand, in the case of a hospital system, it is permissible for the system to have a unified and integrated medical staff (hereafter referred to as a “unified medical staff”) for multiple, separately certified hospitals.  The medical staff mu st be organized and integrated as one 
body that operates under one set of bylaws approved by the governing body.  These medical staff bylaws must apply equally to all practitioners within each category of practitioners at all locations of the hospital and to the care provided at all locations of the hospital.  The medical staff is responsible for the quality of medical care provided to patients by the hospital.  Survey Procedures §482.22  Surveyors assess the manner and degree of noncompliance with the standards within this condition to determine whether there is condition- level noncompliance.

§482.22(a) Standard:  Eligibility and Process for Appointment to Medical 
Staff  
 
The medical staff must be composed of doctors of medicine or osteopathy. In accordance with State law, including scope -of-practice laws, the medical staff may also 
include other categories of physicians (as listed at §482.12(c)(1)) and non -physician 
practi tioners who are determined to be eligible for appointment by the governing 
body.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.22(a)  The hospital’s governing body has the responsibility, consistent with State law, including scope-of-practice laws, to determine which types/categories of physicians and, if it so chooses, non-physician practitioners or other licensed healthcare professiona ls (collectively 
referred to in this guidance as “practitioners”) may be privileged to provide care to hospital patients.  All practitioners who require privileges in order to furnish care to hospital patients must be evaluated under the hospital’s medical staff privileging system before the hospital’s governing body may grant them privileges.   All practitioners granted medical staff privileges must function under the bylaws, regulations and rules of the hospital’s medical staff.  The privileges granted to an individual practitioner must be consistent with State scope-of- practice laws.  
 Physicians:  The medical staff must at a minimum be composed of doctors of medicine  or doctors of 
osteopathy.  In addition, the medical staff may include other types of practitioners included in the definition in Section 1861(r) of the Social Security Act of a “physician:”  
• Doctor of dental surgery or of dental medicine; 
• Doctor of podiatric medicine;  
• Doctor of optometry; and a 
• Chiropractor.  
 In all cases, the practitioner included in the definition of a physician must be legally authorized to practice within the State where the hospital is located and providing services within their authorized scope of practice.  In addition, in certain instances the Social Security Act and regulations attach further limitations as to the type of hospital services for which a practitioner may be considered to be a “physician.”  See §482.12(c)(1) for more detail on these limitations.  
 
The governing body has the flexibility to determine, consistent with State law, whether practitioners included in the definition of a physician, other than doctors of medicine or osteopathy, are eligible for appointment to the medical staff.  
For Information Only – Not Required/ Not to be Cited  
 
CMS expects that all physician practitioners granted privileges are also appointed as 
members of the medical staff.  However, if State law limits the composition of the 
hospital’s medical staff to certain categories of practitioners, e.g., only MDs or DOs, 
there is nothing in the CoPs that prohibits hospitals and their medical staffs from 
establishing certain practice privileges for other categories of physician practitioners 
excluded from medical staff membership under State law, or from granting those 
privileges to individual practitioners in those categories, as long as such privileges are 
recommended by the medical staff, approved by the governing body, and in accordance 
with State law.  (79 FR 27114 - 27115, May 12, 2014) 
 
 For physician practitioners granted privileges only, , the hospital’s governing body and its medical staff must exercise oversight, such as through credentialing and competency review, of those other physician practitioners to whom it grants privileges, just as it would for those practitioners appointed to its medical staff.  
 Non-physician practitioners  
 
Furthermore, the governing body has the authority, in accordance with State law, to grant 
medical staff privileges and membership to non-physician practitioners.  The regulation 
allows hospitals and their medical staffs to take advantage of the expertise a nd skills of all 
types of practitioners who practice at the hospital when making recommendations and decisions concerning medical staff privileges and membership.

 For non-physician practitioners granted privileges only, the hospital’s governing body and its medical staff must exercise oversight, such as through credentialing and competency review, of those non- physician practitioners to whom it grants privileges, just as it would 
for those practitioners appointed to its medical staff.  
 Practitioners are described in Section 1842(b)(18)(C) of the Act as any of the following:  
• Physician assistant (as defined in Section 1861(aa)(5) of the Act); 
 
• Nurse practitioner (as defined in Section 1861(aa)(5) of the Act);  
 
• Clinical nurse specialist (as defined in Section 1861(aa)(5) of the Act); 
 
• Certified registered nurse anesthetist (as defined in Section 1861(bb)(2) of the Act);  
 
• Certified nurse -midwife (as defined in Section 1861(gg)(2) of the Act); 
 
• Clinical social worker (as defined in Section 1861(hh)(1) of the Act); 
 
• Clinical psychologist (as defined in 42 CFR 410.71 for purposes of Section 1861(ii) of the Act);  
 
• Anesthesiologist’s Assistant (as defined in §410.69); or 
 • Registered dietician or nutrition professional. 
 
Other types of licensed healthcare professionals have a more limited scope of practice and 
usually are not eligible for hospital medical staff privileges, unless their permitted scope of practice in their State makes them more comparable to the above types  of non-physician 
practitioners.  Some examples of types of such licensed healthcare professionals who might be eligible for medical staff privileges depending on State law and medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations include, but are not limited to:  
• Physical Therapist  (as defined at §410.60 and §484.4); 
• Occupational Therapist (as defined at §410.59 and §484.4); and 
• Speech Language Therapist (as defined at §410.62 and §484.4).  
 
Furthermore, some States have established a scope of practice for certain licensed 
pharmacists who are permitted to provide patient care services that make them more like the above types of non -physician practitioners, including the monitoring and assessing of 
patients and ordering medications and laboratory tests.  In such States, a hospital may grant medical staff privileges to such pharmacists and/or appoint them as members of the medical staff.  There is no standard term for such pharmacists, although they are sometimes referred to as “clinical pharmacists.”  Practitioners may be granted active, courtesy, emergency, temporary, etc. membership or privileges in accordance with state law and as specified in the medical staff bylaws, rules, and regulations.  
 Survey Procedures §482.22(a)  
 
• Ask the hospital and medical staff leadership to describe the categories of 
practitioners who are members of the medical staff or who may be granted medical staff privileges.  Ask for documentation that supports their response.  
• If the hospital grants medical staff privileges and/or membership to physicians who are not MDs/DOs or to non- physician practitioners, ask the hospital and 
medical staff leadership to describe the process the hospital uses to ensure that any privileges granted are consistent wit h State law.  Ask for documentation that 
supports their response.  
 
 Ask the hospital and medical staff leadership to describe the process by which they exercise oversight of practitioners granted privileges only.

 §482.22(a)(1) - The medical staff must periodically conduct appraisals of its members.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.22(a)(1)  
 The medical staff must at regular intervals appraise the qualifications of all practitioners appointed to the medical staff/granted medical staff privileges.  In the absence of a State law that establishes a timeframe for periodic reappraisal, a hospital’s  medical staff must 
conduct a periodic appraisal of each practitioner.  CMS recommends that an appraisal be conducted at least every 24 months for each practitioner.  The purpose of the appraisal is for the medical staff to determine the suitability of continuing the medical staff membership or privileges of each individual practitioner, to determine if that individual practitioner’s membership or privileges should be c ontinued, 
discontinued, revised, or otherwise changed.  
 The medical staff appraisal procedures must evaluate each individual practitioner’s qualifications and demonstrated competencies to perform each task or activity within the applicable scope of practice or privileges for that type of practitioner for which he/she has been granted privileges.  Components of practitioner qualifications and demonstrated competencies would include at least:  current work practice, special training, quality of specific work, patient outcomes, education, maintenance of continuing education, adherence to medical staff rules, certifications, appropriate licensure, and currency of compliance with licensure requirements.  
 
In addition to the periodic appraisal of members, any procedure/task/activity/privilege 
requested by a practitioner that goes beyond the specified list of privileges for that 
particular category of practitioner requires an appraisal by the medical staff and approval by 
the governing body.  The appraisal must consider evidence of qualification s and 
competencies specific to the nature of the request.  It must also consider whether the activity/task/procedure is one that the hospital can support when it is conducted within the hospital.  Privileges cannot be granted for tasks/procedures/activitie s that are not conducted 
within the hospital, regardless of the individual practitioner’s ability to perform them. 
 After the medical staff conducts its reappraisal of individual members, the medical staff makes recommendations to the governing body to continue, revise, discontinue, limit, or revoke some or all of the practitioner’s privileges, and the governing body ta kes final 
appropriate action.  
 A separate credentials file must be maintained for each medical staff member.  The hospital must ensure that the practitioner and appropriate hospital patient care areas/departments are informed of the privileges granted to the practitioner, as well as of any revisions or revocations of the practitioner’s privileges.  Furthermore, whenever a practitioner’s privileges are limited, revoked, or in any way constrained, the hospital must, in accordance with State and/or Federal laws or regulations, report those constraints to the appropriate State and Federal authorities, registries, and/or data bases, such as the National Practitioner Data Bank.  
 Survey Procedures §482.22(a)(1)  
 
• Determine whether the medical staff has a system in place that is used to reappraise each of its current members and their qualifications at regular intervals, or, if applicable, as prescribed by State law.  
 
• Determine whether the medical staff by -laws identify the process and criteria to be 
used for the periodic appraisal.  
 
• Determine whether the criteria used for reevaluation comply with the requirements 
of this section, State law and hospital bylaws, rules, and regulations.  
 
• Determine whether the medical staff has a system to ensure that practitioners seek approval to expand their privileges for tasks/activities/procedures that go beyond the specified list of privileges for their category of practitioner.  
 
Determine how the medical staff conducts the periodic appraisals of any current member of the medical staff who has not provided patient care at the hospital or who has not provided care for which he/she is privileged to patients at the hospital during the  appropriate 
evaluation time frames.  Is this method in accordance with State law and the hospital’s written criteria for medical staff membership and for granting privileges?

(Rev. 122, Issued: 09- 26-14, Effective: 09 -26-14, Implementation: 09- 26-14) 
 §482.22(a)(2) - The medical staff must examine the credentials of all eligible 
candidates for medical staff membership and make recommendations to the governing body on the appointment of the candidates in accordance with State law, including scope- of-practice laws, and the medical staff bylaws, rules, and regulations.  A 
candidate who has been recommended by the medical staff and who has been appointed by the governing body is subject to all medical staff bylaws, rules, and regulations, in addition to the requirements contained in this section.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.22(a)(2)  
 
There must be a mechanism established to examine credentials of individual prospective 
members (new appointments or reappointments) by the medical staff.  The individual’s credentials to be examined must include at least:  
• A request for clinical privileges;  
 
• Evidence of current licensure;  
 
• Evidence of training and professional education;  
 • Documented experience; and  
 • Supporting references of competence.  
 
The medical staff may not make its recommendation solely on the basis of the presence or absence of board certification, but must consider all of the elements above.  However, this does not mean that the medical staff is prohibited from requiring in its bylaws board certification when considering a MD/DO for medical staff membership or privileges; only that such certification may not be the only factor that the medical staff considers.    The medical staff makes recommendations to the governing body for each candidate for medical staff membership/privileges that are specific to type of appointment and extent of the individual practitioner’s specific clinical privileges, and then the governi ng body takes 
final appropriate action.  
 
Each practitioner who is a member of the medical staff or who holds medical staff privileges is subject to the medical staff’s bylaws, rules, and regulations, in addition to all the requirements of the Medical Staff Condition of Participation.  The medical  staff and the 
governing body must enforce its medical staff requirements and take appropriate actions when individual members or other practitioners with privileges do not adhere to the medical staff’s bylaws, regulations, and rules.  They must likewise a fford all members/practitioners 
who hold privileges the protections and due process rights provided for in the bylaws, rules and regulations.  
 A separate credentials file must be maintained for each individual medical staff member or applicant.  The hospital must ensure that the practitioner and appropriate hospital patient care areas/departments are informed of the privileges granted to the practitioner.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.22(a)(2)  
 
• Determine whether the medical staff bylaws identify the process and criteria 
to be used for the evaluation of candidates for medical staff membership/privileges.  
 
• Determine whether the criteria used for evaluation comply with the 
requirements of this section, State law, and hospital bylaws, rules, and regulations. 
 
• Determine whether the medical staff has a system to ensure that practitioners seek approval to expand their privileges for tasks/activities/procedures that go beyond the specified list of privileges for their category of practitioner.  
 
 Ask the leadership of the medical staff what methods are used to ensure that all medical staff members and non -member practitioners who hold privileges 
adhere to the medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations and are afforded the 
protections and due proce ss rights provided for under the bylaws, rules and 
regulations.  Ask for specific examples of actions taken.  
 
 When interviewing practitioners during the survey, ask how they are made aware of 
their rights and responsibilities with respect to medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations.

 §482.22(a) (3)  When telemedicine services are furnished to the hospital’s patients 
through an agreement with a distant -site hospital, the governing body of the hospital 
whose patients are receiving the telemedicine services may choose, in lieu of the requirements in  paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, to have its medical staff 
rely upon the credentialing and privileging decisions made by the distant -site hospital 
when making recommendations on privileges for the individual distant -site physicians 
and practitioners providing such services, if the hospital’s governing body ensures, through its written agreement with the distant -site hospital, that all of the following 
provisions are met:  
  (i)  The distant- site hospital providing the telemedicine services is a Medicare -
participating hospital.  
 (ii)  The individual distant -site physician or practitioner is privileged at the distant -site 
hospital providing the telemedicine services, which provides a current list of the distant -site physician’s or practitioner’s privileges at the distant -site hospi tal. 
  (iii)  The individual distant -site physician or practitioner holds a license issued 
or recognized by the State in which the hospital whose patients are receiving the telemedicine services is located.  
  (iv)  With respect to a distant- site physician or practitioner, who holds current 
privileges at the hospital whose patients are receiving the telemedicine services, the 
hospital has evidence of an internal review of the distant -site physician’s or 
practit ioner’s performance of these privileges and sends the distant -site hospital such 
performance information for use in the periodic appraisal of the distant -site physician 
or practitioner.  At a minimum, this information must include all adverse events that result from the telemedicine services provided by the distant -site physician or 
practitioner to the hospital’s patients and all complaints the hospital has received about the distant -site physician or practitioner.  
 Interpretive guidelines §482.22(a) (3) 
 The hospital’s governing body has the option, when considering granting privileges to telemedicine physicians and practitioners, to have the hospital’s medical staff rely upon the credentialing and privileging decisions of the distant -site hospital for the se physicians and 
practitioners.  This process would be in lieu of the traditional process required under §482.22(a)(1) and §482.22(a)(2), whereby the hospital’s medical staff conducts its own review of each telemedicine physician’s or practitioner’s credentials and makes a recommendation based on that individualized review.  
 In order to exercise this alternative credentialing and privileging option, the hospital’s governing body must ensure through its written agreement with the distant -site hospital that 
all of the following requirements are met:  
• The distant -site hospital participates in the Medicare program.  If the distant- site 
hospital’s participation in Medicare is terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, at any time during the agreement, then, as of the effective date of the terminatio n, 
the hospital may no longer receive telemedicine services under the agreement;  
 
• The distant -site hospital provides to the hospital a list of all its physicians and 
practitioners covered by the agreement, including their privileges at the distant -site 
hospital.  The list may not include any physician or practitioner who does not hold 
privileges at the distant- site hospital.  The list must be current, so the agreement 
must address how the distant -site hospital will keep the list current; 
 
• Each physician or practitioner who provides telemedicine services to the hospital’s patients under the agreement holds a license issued or recognized by the State where the hospital (not the distant -site hospital) is located.  States may have varying 
requi rements as to whether they will recognize an out -of-state license for purposes 
of practicing within their State, and they may also vary as to whether they establish different standards for telemedicine services.  The licensure requirements governing in the  State where the hospital whose patients are receiving the telemedicine 
services is located must be satisfied, whatever they may be;  and  
 
• The hospital has evidence that it reviews the telemedicine services provided to its 
patients and provides feedback based on this review to the distant -site hospital for 
the latter’s use in its periodic appraisal of each physician and practitioner providing 
telemedicine services under the agreement.  At a minimum, the hospital must review and send information to the distant -site hospital on all adverse events that result 
from a physician or practitioner’s provision of telemedicine services under the agreemen t and on all complaints it has received about a telemedicine physician or 
practitioner covered by the agreement.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.22(a)(3)  
 
• If the hospital provides telemedicine services to its patients under an agreement with a distant -site hospital, ask whether the hospital’s governing body has exercised the 
option to have the medical staff rely upon the credentialing and privileging decisio ns of the distant -site hospital in making privileging recommendations on 
telemedicine physicians and practitioners.  If yes, ask to see:  
 
• The written agreement with the distant- site hospital.  Does the agreement 
address the required elements concerning the distant -site hospital’s Medicare 
participation, licensure of telemedicine physicians and practitioners, current list of telemedicine phys icians and practitioners with privileges, and review by the 
hospital of the telemedicine physicians’ and practitioners’ services and provision of information based on its review to the distant -site hospital?  
 
• The list provided by the distant -site hospital of the telemedicine physicians and 
practitioners, including their current privileges and pertinent licensure 
information. 
 
Evidence that the hospital reviews the services provided by the telemedicine physicians and practitioners, including any adverse events and complaints, and provides feedback to the distant -site hospital.

(Rev. 78, Issued: 12- 22-11, Effective/Implementation: 12- 22-11) 
 §482.22(a)(4)  When telemedicine services are furnished to the hospital’s patients through an agreement with a distant -site telemedicine entity, the governing body of 
the hospital whose patients are receiving the telemedicine services may choose, in lieu of the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, to have its medical staff rely upon the credentialing and privileging decisions made by the  distant - site 
telemedicine entity when making recommendations on privileges for the individual 
distant -site physicians and practitioners providing such services, if the hospital’s 
governing body ensures, through its written agreement with the distant -site 
telemedicine entity, that the distant- site telemedicine entity furnishes services that, in 
accordance with §482.12(e), permit the hospital to comply with all applicable 
conditions of participation for the contracted services. The hospital’s governing body must also ensu re, through its written agreement with the distant -site telemedicine 
entity, that all of the following provisions are met:  
 (i)  The distant- site telemedicine entity’s medical staff credentialing and privileging 
process and standards at least meet the standards at §482.12(a)(1) through (a)(7) and §482.22(a)(1) through (a)(2).  
 (ii)  The individual distant -site physician or practitioner is privileged at the distant -site 
telemedicine entity providing the telemedicine services, which provides the hospital with a current list of the distant- site physician’s or practitioner’s privile ges at the 
distant -site telemedicine entity.  
 (iii)  The individual distant -site physician or practitioner holds a license issued or 
recognized by the State in which the hospital whose patients are receiving such telemedicine services is located.  
 (iv)  With respect to a distant- site physician or practitioner, who holds current 
privileges at the hospital whose patients are receiving the telemedicine services, the hospital has evidence of an internal review of the distant -site physician’s or 
practiti oner’s performance of these privileges and sends the distant -site telemedicine 
entity such performance information for use in the periodic appraisal of the distant -
site physician or practitioner.  At a minimum, this information must include all adverse events that result from the telemedicine services provided by the distant -site 
physician or practitioner to the hospital’s patients, and all complaints the hospital has received about the distant -site physician or practitioner.  
 Interpretive guidelines §482.22(a) (4) 
 For the purposes of this rule, a distant -site telemedicine entity is defined as an entity that -- 
(1) provides telemedicine services; (2) is not a Medicare -participating hospital; and (3) 
provides contracted services in a manner that enables a hospital usi ng its services to meet 
all applicable Conditions of Participation, particularly those requirements related to the credentialing and privileging of practitioners providing telemedicine services to the patients of a hospital.  A distant -site telemedicine en tity would include a distant -site hospital that 
does not participate in the Medicare program that is providing telemedicine services to a Medicare- participating hospital.  (See 76 FR 25553, May 5, 2011)  
 The hospital’s governing body has the option, when considering granting privileges to telemedicine physicians and practitioners, to have the hospital’s medical staff rely upon the credentialing and privileging decisions of the distant -site telemedicine ent ity for these 
physicians and practitioners.  This process would be in lieu of the traditional process required under §482.22(a)(1) and §482.22(a)(2), whereby the medical staff conducts its own review of each telemedicine physician’s or practitioner’s credentials and makes a recommendation based on that individualized review.  
 
In order to exercise this alternative credentialing and privileging option, the hospital’s 
governing body must ensure that its written agreement with the distant -site hospital enables 
the hospital, as required under the regulation at §482.12(e) governing s ervices provided 
under arrangement, to comply with all applicable hospital Conditions of Participation.  In particular, the written agreement between the hospital and the distant -site telemedicine 
entity must ensure that all of the following requirements a re met:  
 
• The distant -site telemedicine entity utilizes a medical staff credentialing and 
privileging process and standards that at least meets the standards for the medical 
staff of a hospital established at §482.12(a)(1) through (a)(7) and §482.22(a)(1) through (a)(2);  
 
• The distant -site telemedicine entity provides a list to the hospital of all physicians 
and practitioners covered by the agreement, including their privileges at the distant -
site telemedicine entity.  The list may not include any physician or practitioner w ho 
does not hold privileges at the distant -site telemedicine entity.  The list must be 
current, so the agreement must address how the distant -site telemedicine entity will 
keep the list current;  
 • Each physician or practitioner who provides telemedicine services to the hospital’s 
patients under the agreement holds a license issued or recognized by the State where the hospital is located.  States may have varying requirements as to whether they will recognize an out -of-state license for purposes of practicing within their State, 
and they may also vary as to whether they establish different standards for telemedicine services.  The licensure requirements governing in the State where the hospital whose patients are receiving the telemedicine services is located must be satisfied, whatever they may be; and  
 
• The hospital has evidence that it reviews the telemedicine services provided to its 
patients and provides a written copy of this review to the distant -site telemedicine 
entity for the latter’s use in its periodic appraisal of the physicians and practitione rs 
providing telemedicine services under the agreement.  At a minimum, the hospital 
must review and send information to the distant -site telemedicine entity on all 
adverse events that result from a physician or practitioner’s provision of telemedicine serv ices and on all complaints it has received about a telemedicine 
physician or practitioner.  
 Survey Procedures 482.22(a)(4)  
 
• If the hospital provides telemedicine services to its patients under an agreement with 
a one or more distant -site telemedicine entities, ask whether the hospital’s governing 
body has exercised the option to have the medical staff rely upon the credentialing 
and privileging decisions of the distant -site telemedicine entity in making 
privileging recommendations on telemedicine physicians and practitioners.  If yes, ask to see:  
 
• The written agreement(s) with the distant- site telemedicine entity(ies).  Does 
each agreement address the required elements concerning the distant -site 
telemedicine entity’s utilization of a medical staff credentialing and privileging process that meets th e requirements of the hospital CoPs, appropriate licensure 
of telemedicine physicians and practitioners, current list of telemedicine physicians and practitioners specifying their privileges, and written review by the hospital of the telemedicine physician s’ and practitioners’ services and 
provision of information based on its review to the distant -site hospital?  
 
• The list provided by the distant -site telemedicine entity of the telemedicine 
physicians and practitioners covered by the agreement, including their current 
privileges and pertinent licensure information. 
 
• Evidence that the hospital reviews the services provided by the telemedicine 
physicians and practitioners, including any adverse events and complaints, and provides written feedback to the distant -site telemedicine entity.   
 
• Ask the hospital how it verifies that the telemedicine entity employs a 
credentialing and privileging process that meets or exceeds what is required for hospitals under the Medicare CoPs?  (Surveyors do not attempt to independently verify whether or not the distant -site telemedicine entity’s credentialing and 
privileging process fulfills the regulatory requirements.  Surveyors focus only on whether the hospital takes steps to ensure that the distant -site telemedicine entity 
complies with the terms of the wr itten agreement.)

§482.22(b) Standard:  Medical Staff Organization and Accountability  
 The medical staff must be well organized and accountable to the governing body for the quality of the medical care provided to the patients.  
 
(1)  The medical staff must be organized in a manner approved by the governing body.  (2)  If the medical staff has an executive committee, a majority of the members of the 
committee must be doctors of medicine or osteopathy. 
 (3)  The responsibility for organization and conduct of the medical staff must be 
assigned only to one of the following:  
 
(i) An individual doctor of medicine or osteopathy.  
(ii) A doctor of dental surgery or dental medicine, when permitted by State law of the State in which the hospital is located.  
(iii) A doctor of podiatric medicine, when permitted by State law of the State in which the hospital is located.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.22(b)(1) – (3)  
 The conditions of participation create a system of checks and balances within an overall framework of collaboration between the governing body and the medical staff (and, to a certain degree, also between an individual practitioner and the hospital’s medic al staff and 
governing body).  Each has its own areas of authority.  The medical staff has oversight of all practitioners practicing in the hospital through processes such as peer review and making 
recommendations concerning privileging and re -privileging.  The governing body has the 
authority to establish the categories of healthcare professionals (regardless of the terms used to describe those categories) who are eligible for privileges and medical staff appointment.  However, the governing body must rely on the medical staff to apply the criteria for privileging and appointment to those eligible candidates and to make their recommendations before the governing body makes a final decision to appoint or not appoint a practitioner to the medical staff.  (77 FR 29042 May 16, 2012).  
 If the hospital uses a unified medical staff that it shares with other hospitals that are part of a multi- hospital system, this does not change the requirement for the medical staff to be 
well organized and accountable to the system’s governing body for the quality of care in each separately certified hospital.  
 Leadership of the medical staff  
 
The members of the hospital’s medical staff must select, in accordance with the medical staff bylaws, rules or regulations approved by the governing body, a single individual to lead the medical staff and be responsible for the organization and conduct of the medical 
staff.  This individual must be a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, or, if permitted by State 
law where the hospital is located, a doctor of dental surgery, dental medicine, or podiatric 
medicine.  Removal of the leader of the medical staff may only occur in accordance with 
medical staff bylaws, rules or regulations. 
 If the hospital uses a unified medical staff, only one individual may be responsible for the organization and conduct of the unified medical staff; that individual may or may not hold privileges and practice at the hospital being surveyed.  When the individual does not practice at the hospital being surveyed and it is necessary to interview this individual as part of a survey, a telephone interview must be arranged.  Executive Committee  
 The medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations may provide for the members of the medical staff to select a smaller executive committee to which it delegates many of the functions of the medical staff, in order to increase the efficiency of its operations.  If the medical staff has an executive committee, the majority of the voting members must be doctors of medicine (MDs) or osteopathy (DOs).  
For Information Only – Not Required/ Not to be Cited  
 
A hospital is not required to have an executive committee.  However, use of an executive 
committee may facilitate efficient and effective functioning of the medical staff in 
hospitals systems that use a unified medical staff, particularly if the executive committee 
includes members from each hospital that shares the unified medical staff. 
 
 Accountability of the medical staff  
 The medical staff must be accountable to the hospital’s governing body for the quality of medical care provided to the patients.  The medical staff demonstrates its accountability through its exercise of its duties related to appointment of members of the medical staff, its 
conduct of reappraisals, including peer reviews, its approval of policies and procedures as required under other conditions of participation and its leadership participation in the organization and implementation of the hospital’s qualit y assessment and performance 
improvement program required in accordance with §482.21. If the hospital uses a unified medical staff, the medical staff continues to be accountable for the quality of care in each separately certified hospital that uses the unified medical staff.  
 Survey Procedures §482.22(b)(1) – (3)  
 
• Verify that the medical staff has a formal, organized structure reflected in the medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations and that functions and responsibilities within the medical staff and with respect to the governing body and other parts of the hospital are reflected.  
 
• If there is a medical staff executive committee, verify that a majority of the members are doctors of medicine or osteopathy. 
 
• Verify that an individual doctor of medicine or osteopathy, or if permitted by State law, a doctor of dental surgery, dental medicine, or podiatric medicine, selected by the medical staff, is responsible for the conduct and organization of the medical staf f. 
 
• Ask the CEO and medical staff leadership to describe the mechanisms by 
which the medical staff fulfills its responsibility to be accountable for the 
quality of medical care in the hospital.  
 
• Interview several members of the medical staff, including both practitioners who 
hold leadership or executive committee positions and ones who do not.  Ask them 
what their medical staff duties and responsibilities are and how they perform them.  Ask them to describe how the medical staff is accountable for the quality of medical care provided to patients. 
 
A-0348 
(Rev. 122, Issued: 09-26-14, Effective: 09-26-14, Implementation: 09-26-14)  §482.22(b)(4) -  If a hospital is part of a hospital system consisting of multiple separately certified hospitals and the system elects to have a unified and integrated medical staff for its member hospitals, after determining that such a decision is in accordance with all  applicable State and local laws, each separately certified hospital 
must demonstrate that:….  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.22(b)(4)  A hospital that is part of a system consisting of multiple separately certified hospitals may use a single unified and integrated medical staff (hereafter referred to as a “unified medical staff”) that is shared with one or more of the other hospitals in the system.  In other words, as long as the requirements of §482.22(b)(4) are met, it is not necessary for each separately-certified hospital within the system to have its own distinct medical staff organization and structure, including hospital- specific medical staff bylaws, rules and requirements, hospital-
specific medical staff leadership, hospital- specific credentialing and peer review, etc.  
Instead, it may use one medical staff organization and structure for multiple hospitals, so long as all of the requirements of this section are met.  However, separately certified hospitals which share a single unified and integrated medical staff must also share a system governing body, in accordance with the provisions of §482.12, since only one governing body may carry out the governing body’s medical staff responsibilities for a unified medical staff.  
 
Note that a multi-campus hospital that has several inpatient campuses that are provider-based, remote locations of the hospital is not a multi- hospital system.  A multi- campus 
hospital is one certified hospital, not several separately certified hospitals.  A multi- campus 
hospital may not have separate medical staffs at each campus, since each hospital must have no more than one medical s taff.  A multi- campus hospital with one medical staff separate 
from that of other certified hospitals is not employing a unified medical staff as that term is used in this regulation.  However, a multi- campus hospital that is part of a hospital system 
consisting of multiple separately certified hospitals may share a unified medical staff with other separately certified hospit als within the system.  
 It should also be noted that a hospital system that includes certain types of hospitals, i.e., Hospitals -within -Hospitals or Hospital Satellites, that are being paid under a Medicare 
payment system other than the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Syst em (IPPS) 
might jeopardize the Medicare payment status of those excluded hospitals if it owns both the tenant and host hospitals and uses a unified medical staff for both.  This is the case even if the requirements of §482.22(b)(4) are met.  However, surveyors do not assess compliance with or enforce the Medicare payment regulations that govern Hospitals- within -Hospitals or 
Hospital Satellites.  
 When granting practitioners privileges to provide patient care, a hospital’s governing body must specify those hospitals in the system where the privileges apply, since, in addition to the qualifications of individual practitioners, the services provided at each hospital must be considered when granting privileges.  For example, psychiatric hospitals do not offer surgical services, labor and delivery services, nuclear medicine, etc., so it would not be appropriate for practitioners practicing in these areas to hold privileges at psychiatric hospitals in a multi- hospital system that uses a unified medical staff.  Likewise if a multi-
hospital system covers a wide geographic area, many of its practitioners may have no 
interest in practicing on site at hospitals that are distant from their usual practice location(s).  
In addition, in order for the acceptance or opt -out provisions of §482.22(b)(4)(i) and (ii) to 
be workable, privileges must be granted on a hospital -specific basis to practitioners who 
actually practice or are likely to practice at the hospital.  
 The governing body in a multi -hospital system must elect to exercise this option.  Since a 
number of hospital systems interpreted the Medical Staff CoP to permit a unified and integrated medical staff prior to publication of the final rule at §482.22(b)(4)  on May 12, 
2014 or its effective date on July 11, 2014, the existence of a unified medical staff prior to 
July 11, 2014 is considered evidence of the hospital’s governing body’s election of this 
option. 
 
• This does not relieve the governing body of the responsibility to conduct a review of all applicable State and local laws, including regulations, and make a determination that use of a unified medical staff that is shared by multiple hospitals does not conflict with those laws.  The hospital must maintain documentation of this determination by its governing body.  
• Nor does it relieve the governing body of the obligation to inform the 
medical staff of the right to vote to opt out of a unified medical staff 
arrangement.  (See discussion of §482.22(b)(4)(ii), which requires notification of all members of this right.  F ailure to comply would be cited 
under the tag for §482.22(b)(4)(ii).)  
 If a hospital is part of a multi- hospital system that wishes to establish a unified medical staff 
for some or all of its separately certified hospitals after the July 11, 2014 effective date of the final rule at §482.22(b)(4), then the hospital’s system governing body must document in writing its decision to elect to use the unified medical staff option,  conditioned upon acceptance of a unified medical staff by the hospital’s medical staff in accordance with 
§482.22(b)(4)(i).The governing body must also document its determination that such election does not conflict with State or local laws, including regulations.  Surveyors are not expected, as part of their assessment of compliance with the Medicare CoPs, to evaluate whether the governing body’s determination of compliance with State and local law is accurate.  This would be handled by the appropriate State or loca l authorities, 
or, if the State Survey Agency is the appropriate authority, under its State licensure or other authority and not as part of a Federal survey.  
 Survey Procedures §482.22(b)(4)  
 
• Ask the hospital and medical staff leadership if the hospital is part of a multi-
hospital system of separately certified hospitals.  If yes, ask if the hospital also shares its governing body and medical staff with one or more other separately-certified ho spitals in the system.  
 
• If yes:  
 
• Does the use of the unified medical staff predate July 11, 2014?  If yes, 
ask for documentation of the governing body’s determination that use of a unified medical staff does not conflict with State or local law.  
 
• Did the use of the unified medical staff start after July 11, 2014?  If yes, 
ask for documentation of the governing body’s decision to elect use of a 
unified medical staff and of its determination that use of a unified medical staff does not conflict with State or local law.  
 
• Can the hospital produce documentation that practitioners who practice 
at the hospital have been granted privileges by the hospital’s governing 
body that specify the practitioner’s privileges apply to specific hospital(s), which include the hospital being surveyed?

(Rev. 122, Issued: 09-26-14, Effective: 09-26-14, Implementation: 09-26-14)  [§482.22(b)(4) - If a hospital is part of a hospital system consisting of multiple separately certified hospitals and the system elects to have a unified and integrated medical staff for its member hospitals, after determining that such a decision is in accordance with all applicable State and local laws, each separately certified hospital must demonstrate that:] 
 
(i)  The medical staff members of each separately certified hospital in the system (that is, all medical staff members who hold specific privileges to practice at that hospital) have voted by majority, in accordance with medical staff bylaws, either to acc ept a 
unified and integrated medical staff structure or to opt out of such a structure and to maintain a separate and distinct medical staff for their respective hospital;  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.22(b)(4)(i)  The decision for a particular certified hospital in a multi-hospital system to use a unified medical staff is a joint one arrived at by the:  
 
• Election  of the unified medical staff option by the hospital’s governing body; 
and  
 
• Acceptance by a majority of the medical staff members who hold privileges to 
practice at that particular hospital, voting in accordance with the medical staff bylaws. 
 The medical staff of each hospital also has the option to opt out of an existing unified medical staff, when a majority of the medical staff members who hold privileges to practice at that particular hospital, voting in accordance with the medical staff by laws, vote to do so. 
 For purposes of voting on whether to accept or opt out of a unified medical staff, the term “privileges to practice at that particular hospital” is interpreted to mean only those practitioners who hold privileges to practice on- site at the hospital.  Practitioners who hold 
only telemedicine privileges at a hospital are not to be included when identifying which practitioners are eligible to vote nor what constitutes a majority of the practitioners holding privileges at the hospital.  
 A hospital that is part of a hospital system is expected to have medical staff bylaws, rules and requirements that address the regulatory requirements of §482.22(b)(4)(i) – (iv) related to using a unified medical staff, including the processes under the bylaws for voting to accept or opt out of a unified medical staff.  This is the case even if the hospital currently does not use a unified medical staff.  If the hospital uses a unified medical staff, depending on State law requirements, the unified medical staff bylaws, rules and requirements required at §482.22(b)(4)(ii) may substitute for hospital- specific medical staff bylaws, rules and requirements.  Ho wever, CMS 
recognizes that the process of amending bylaws can be a lengthy one.  Hospitals that were part of a hospital system using a unified medical staff as of July 11, 2014 are expected to 
have initiated the process before December 31, 2014 to effect t he necessary amendments, 
even if the process is not completed until after that date.  Likewise, when a hospital is 
acquired by a system but maintains separate participation in Medicare, if the hospital’s 
governing body elects to use a unified medical staff and the medical staff accepts such 
election, the hospital is expected to initiate the necessary changes to its med ical staff 
bylaws, rules and requirements no later than six months after the effective date of its acquisition. 
 In establishing medical staff bylaws governing medical staff voting on the questions of acceptance of, or opting out of, a unified medical staff, the medical staff and the governing body, which must approve the revised bylaws in accordance with §482.12(a)( 4), have the 
flexibility to determine the details of the voting process, such as how an acceptance or opt -
out vote can be requested; whether all categories of members holding privileges to practice 
on-site at the hospital are afforded medical staff voting rights; whether voting will be in 
writing and open or by secret ballot, etc.  However, a hospital may not set up bylaws that 
unduly restrict the rights of medical staff members when voting on the issue of accepting or opting out of a unified medical staff structure.  For example:  
 
 Hospitals may not establish different criteria as to which categories of medical staff members have voting rights with respect to a vote to accept or opt out of a unified medical staff than are used for other amendments to the medical staff’s bylaws, excep t as required under the regulation at §482.22(b)(4) that only members holding 
privileges to practice at the hospital may vote.  (See also the discussion below concerning delegation of authority to the medical staff executive committee.)  
 
 Hospitals may not require as a condition for holding an opt -out vote that there be a 
petition signed by the same number of voting members as would be required for a successful vote to opt out. 
 
 Hospitals may require for a successful acceptance or opt -out vote  a 
“supermajority”, that is, a majority that is greater than a simple majority of more than fifty percent of the medical staff members with voting rights holding privileges 
to practice at th e hospital, so long as the same type of supermajority is otherwise 
generally required to amend the medical staff’s bylaws, rules and requirements. 
 
 In the case where a hospital system has a unified medical staff and members of the staff at a hospital in the system exercise their right to hold a vote on the question of opting out, the hospital may not permit delegation of an opt -out decision to the 
unified medical staff’s executive committee.  This is the case even when the 
executive committee is otherwise delegated authority to amend unified medical staff bylaws, rules and requirements that it recommends for approval to the governing body.  In cases where the bylaws permit such delegation to the unified medical staff’s executive committee for other purposes, a “majority” for purposes of conducting a vote on whether to opt out of a unified medical staff consists of a simple majority, that is, any number which is greater than fifty percent, of the medical staff members practicing at the hospital who have voting privileges. 
 
o On the other hand, in the case where a hospital that is part of a hospital system but has a separate medical staff is holding a vote on whether to accept participating in a unified medical staff, a hospital may permit a vote by members of the hospital’s me dical staff executive committee only, if this is consistent 
with the hospital’s medical staff bylaws governing amendments in effect at the time of the vote.  
 
 A hospital may establish a minimum interval between acceptance or opt -out votes, 
such as not permitting a vote more than once every two years.  However, a minimum interval between votes longer than two years might unduly restrain the rights of the members of the medical staff and would not be permissible. 
 
 
 
It is not expected that the medical staff bylaws, rules and requirements that were in effect as of July 11, 2014 would address the issue of a unified medical staff, nor the process of voting by medical staff members at each hospital to accept or opt out of a unified medical staff.  Although it is expected that the medical staff bylaws, rules and requirements of hospitals that are part of a hospital system will be amended in a timely fashion as discussed above, this does not mean that a vote to accept or opt out of a unified medical staff may not take place prior to enactment of such amendments.  Voting is governed by the hospital’s medical staff bylaws in effect at the time of the vote, except that only voting members of the medical staff who hold privileges to practice on -site 
at that hospital may participate in the vote.  With respect to what co nstitutes a “majority,” 
the provisions of the bylaws governing voting rights and voting procedures at the time of the vote apply.  However, as discussed above, in the case of a vote to opt -out of a unified 
medical staff, the vote may not be delegated to th e executive committee of the unified 
medical staff.  
 Since a number of hospital systems interpreted the Medical Staff CoP to permit a unified medical staff prior to publication of the final rule at §482.22(b)(4) on May 12, 2014 or its effective date of July 11, 2014, in the case of a hospital’s use of a unif ied medical staff 
which began prior to the latter date, it is not necessary for the hospital to hold a vote among the members of the medical staff who hold privileges at that hospital to determine whether the majority accepts the continued use of a unified medical staff.  However, the governing 
body is expected to formally notify the medical staff practicing at each hospital of its preference to continue using a unified medical staff arrangement, as well as of the right of 
the medical staff holding privileg es at each hospital to vote to opt out of the unified medical 
staff.  
 If the system governing body of a hospital that is part of the multi -hospital system but 
which has a separate medical staff elects after July 11, 2014 to create a system unified medical staff structure and/or to include the hospital’s medical staff in an a lready existing 
unified medical staff structure, the hospital must arrange for a vote by medical staff members, in accordance with the medical staff bylaws, on whether or not to accept use of a unified medical staff for their hospital.  The hospital may not use a unified medical staff unless a majority of its medical staff members holding voting rights vote, in accordance with the hospital’s medical staff bylaws, to accept a unified medical staff.  
 Even if a majority of a hospital’s medical staff has voted to use a unified medical staff in the past, the members of the unified medical staff with voting rights and holding privileges to practice on -site at that hospital still retain the right to hold a vote to opt out of the unified 
medical staff structure at a future date.  If a majority of the staff with voting rights and holding privileges at that hospital vote, in accordance with the unified medical staff’s bylaws, to opt out, then the hospital must establish a separate medical staff.  
 Survey Procedures §482.22(b)(4)(i)  
 
• Assess compliance with this regulation if the hospital  is part of a system that 
consists of more than one separately certified hospital, regardless of whether it uses a unified medical staff at the time of survey or not. (See survey procedures for §482.22(b)(4) above.)  
 
• If the hospital uses a unified medical staff, ask the hospital’s leadership when it 
began to do so.  Is there any documentation to support the response?  
 
• If the hospital began using a unified medical staff after July 11, 2014, is there evidence that a majority of the medical staff holding privileges at the 
hospital at the time of the vote voted in accordance with medical staff 
bylaws to accept using a unified medical staff?  
 
• If the hospital uses a unified medical staff, do the medical staff bylaws clearly 
describe a process by which a vote to opt out of using a unified medical staff may be requested and conducted?  
 
• Are there provisions that are described in the guidance above as unduly 
limiting the rights of medical staff members to vote on whether to accept or opt out of a unified medical staff?  
 
• If there are other requirements in the voting process that appear to limit opt -
out voting, ask the medical staff leadership to explain why the limitations are reasonable and not unduly restrictive.  
 
• Ask the hospital and members of the medical staff whether there has ever 
been a vote on the question of opting out.  If yes, ask the hospital to produce 
evidence that a majority of the practitioners holding privileges at the hospital voted against opting out. 
 
• Can the hospital readily identify the medical staff members  who  are eligible to 
vote whether to accept or to opt out of a unified medical staff?

oversight, as well as its peer review policies and due process rights guarantees, and which include a process for the members of the medical staff of each separately certified hospital (that is, all medical staff members who hold specific privileges to practice at that hospital) to be advised of their rights to opt out of the unifie d and 
integrated medical staff structure after a majority vote by the members to maintain a separate and distinct medical staff for their hospital;  Interpretive Guidelines §482.22(b)(4)(ii)  
 A hospital that uses a unified medical staff must ensure that the unified medical staff has one set of bylaws, rules and requirements that describe the medical staff’s processes for self-governance, appointment, credentialing, privileging, oversight, peer review, and due 
process rights guarantees.  Consistent with the requirements for a system governing body in §482.12, the documentation of the bylaws, rules and requirements that apply to the unified medical staff must identify each separately certified hos pital that has elected to use a 
unified medical staff and which, therefore, is covered by the unified medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations.  Depending on State law requirements, the unified medical staff bylaws, rules and requirements may be in addi tion to or instead of hospital -specific medical 
staff bylaws, rules and requirements. The unified medical staff’s bylaws, rules and requirements must not conflict with any of the specific requirements for medical staff found elsewhere in §482.12 or §482.22, or under any other hospital CoPs which assign responsibilities to the hospital’s medical staff.  
 
The unified medical staff’s bylaws, rules and requirements addressing its self -governance 
processes must provide for a process by which members of the unified medical staff 
holding privileges to practice on site at each separately certified hospital are ad vised that 
they have the right to vote on whether to opt out of participation in the unified medical staff, and that if a majority vote to opt out, then the hospital must establish a separate medical staff.  At a minimum, the hospital must advise medical s taff members in writing of 
their right to vote by majority to opt out when medical staff membership is first granted, and when it is renewed.  
 The bylaws must address the process by which a vote to opt out of the unified medical staff is conducted.  In establishing the unified medical staff bylaws governing opting out, the unified medical staff, and the system governing body, which must approve t he medical 
staff’s bylaws, rules or regulations in accordance with §482.12(a)(4), have the flexibility to determine the details of the voting process, such as how an acceptance or opt -out vote can 
be requested; whether all categories of members holding pri vileges to practice on -site at the 
hospital are afforded medical staff voting rights; whether voting will be in writing and open or by secret ballot, etc.  However, the unified medical staff and system governing body may not set up bylaws that unduly restr ict the rights of medical staff members at each separately 
certified hospital to vote whether to accept or opt out of a unified medical staff structure.  For example:  
 
 The bylaws, rules and requirements may not establish different criteria as to which categories of medical staff members have voting rights with respect to a vote to accept or opt out of a unified medical staff than are used for any other type of voting the medical staff engages in, except as required under the regulation at 
§482.22(b)(4) that only members holding privileges to practice at the  hospital may 
vote.  (See also the discussion below concerning delegation of authority to the medical staff executive committee.)  
 
 The bylaws, rules and requirements may not require as a condition for holding an opt-out vote that there be a petition signed by the same number of voting members 
as would be required for a successful vote to opt out. 
 
 The bylaws, rules and requirements may require for   a successful acceptance or opt -
out vote a “super -majority,” that is, a majority that is greater than a simple majority 
of more than fifty percent of the medical staff members with voting rights holding privileges to practice at the hospital, so long as the same type of supermajority is otherwise required to amend the unified medical staff’s bylaws, rules and requirements.  
 
 In the case where a hospital system has a unified medical staff and members of the staff at a hospital in the system exercise their right to hold a vote on the question of opting out, the unified medical staff bylaws may not permit delegation of an opt -out 
decision to the unified medical staff’s executive committee.  This is the case even when the executive committee is otherwise delegated authority to amend unified medical staff bylaws, rules and requirements that it recommends for approval to the governing body.

 The bylaws, rules and requirements may establish a minimum interval between

• Assess compliance with this regulation only if the hospital uses a unified 
medical staff.  (See survey procedures for §482.22(b)(4) above)  
 
• Ask the hospital’s leadership for evidence that the unified medical staff’s bylaws, rules and requirements are readily available, and that it is clear that they apply to that hospital. 
• Ask the hospital’s leadership to provide evidence that the unified medical staff bylaws, rules or requirements address the rights of members holding privileges and voting rights at the hospital to vote to opt out of using the unified medical staff, includi ng notification of these rights.  
 
• Ask how the unified medical staff bylaws define a majority for the purpose of an 
opt-out vote.  If the unified medical staff bylaws require a super -majority, ask 
for evidence that this is consistent with the way “majority” is defined for other 
amendments t o the bylaws. 
 
• Do the bylaws, rules or requirements clearly describe how and when voting members holding privileges at the hospital are advised of their rights?  
 
• Can the hospital readily identify the members of the unified medical staff practicing at the hospital who are eligible to vote to opt out and therefore must be advised of their rights?  
 
• Do the credentialing and privileging files of members of the medical staff have any evidence of their being notified of their right to vote by majority to opt out?  
 
• Interview several members of the medical staff to determine if they recall being notified of their right to vote by majority to opt out.

separately certified hospitals and the system elects to have a unified and integrated medical staff for its member hospitals, after determining that such a decision is in accordance with all applicable State and local laws, each separately certified hospital 
must demonstrate that:]  (iii) -  The unified and integrated medical staff is established in a manner that takes 
into account each member hospital’s unique circumstances and any significant differences in patient populations and services offered in each hospital; and….  
 
Interpretive Guidelines
 §482.22(b)(4)(iii)  
 The separately certified hospitals belonging to a multi -hospital system and using a single 
unified medical staff may be very different from each other, presenting different needs and challenges for the medical staff.  As a result, the unified medical staff  is expected to take 
these differences into account rather than using a one -size- fits-all approach for all of its 
policies and procedures.  For example, a multi -hospital system may: 
 
• Consist of a mixture of different types of hospitals, such as short -term acute care 
hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, children’s hospitals, and 
long-term care hospitals.  As a result, they would offer different types of 
services to different patient populations.  This could have implications for 
medical staff functions such as the periodic review of credentials and privileges and ongoing peer revi ew of the quality of medical care.  It could also have 
implications for other responsibilities the medical staff has under various CoPs.  For example, the medical staff has a key role in the development and oversight of the use of standing orders/protocols , but these orders/protocols may need to 
be specific to each hospital, reflecting the types of services a hospital offers and its patient population;  
 
 Consist of hospitals that differ in size, ranging from comparatively small hospitals in rural areas, or which provide specialized rehabilitation or long term care hospital services, to very large short term acute care service hospitals.  Such differences could have implications for various medical staff requirements, such as on -call 
requirements.  
 
 Consist of hospitals that differ as to whether they are teaching hospitals or not, which would have implications for policies concerning the roles and supervision of residents.  
 
 Consist of hospitals that are located in different states which have different licensure requirements affecting the organization and composition of the medical staff.  For example, in one state it might be permissible for non- physician practitioners to be 
members of the medical staff, while in another the medical staff is limited to physicians.  
On the other hand, a multi -hospital system may have a conscious strategy of having 
hospitals that are very similar to each other in terms of size, services, patient populations served, and type of location.  In this case, the unified medical staff would ha ve fewer 
challenges in addressing the needs of each hospital, and might have more policies that are uniform across the medical staff.  
 In all cases the hospital’s leadership and the medical staff leadership must be able to explain how the way in which the unified medical staff is organized and functions takes account of 
and responds to the unique circumstances of the hospital that is being surveyed.   Survey Procedures §482.22(b)(4)(iii)  
 
• Assess compliance with this regulation only if the hospital uses a unified medical staff.  (See survey procedures for §482.22(b)(4) above)  
  Ask the hospital’s and medical staff’s leadership to describe the other types of hospitals in the system with which it shares a unified medical staff, and how the hospital’s unique circumstances are addressed.  For example, how does the unified medical sta ff assure that:  
 o Standing orders  it has approved are also approved by the nursing and pharmacy 
leadership in each separately certified hospitals? (see §482.24(c)(3)(i));  
 o Policies and procedures developed by the medical staff to minimize drug errors, if this function has not been delegated to the hospital’s pharmaceutical service, take into account any unique hospital circumstances? (see §482.25);  
 o The formulary system established by the medical staff takes into account any unique hospital circumstances?  (See §482.25(b)(9));  
 
o The medical staff’s specification of procedures and treatments requiring a 
properly executed informed consent reflects any unique hospital circumstances?  
(see §482.24(c)(4)(v));  
 
o The medical staff carries out its joint responsibility with the CEO and Director of nursing for ensuring that hospital -specific infection control problems 
identified by the hospital’s infection control officer(s) are addressed in the hospital’s QAPI and tr aining programs?  (see §482.42(b));  
 o The medical staff fulfills its joint executive responsibilities, along with the hospital’s governing body and administrative officials, for ensuring that the hospital -specific QAPI program is:  
 
Ongoing, defined, implemented and maintained;  
Addresses hospital -specific priorities for improved quality of care and patient 
safety, and that all improvements are evaluated;  
Establishes clear expectations for safety in the hospital;  
Allocates adequate resources for the hospital -specific QAPI program; and  
Determines annually the number of distinct improvement projects conducted in 
the hospital?  
(See §482.21(e))  
 
o Medical staff policies governing ordering of outpatient services address any unique hospital circumstances?  (See §482.54(c)(4))  
 
o Medical staff policies and recommendations governing which practitioners may be authorized to write orders and be responsible for the care of the patient conform to State law, including scope of practice law, for the State in which the hospital is 
located? (multiple citations in various CoPs)

separately certified hospitals and the system elects to have a unified and integrated medical staff for its member hospitals, after determining that such a decision is in accordance with all applicable State and local laws, each separately certified hospital 
must demonstrate that:]  (iv)  The unified and integrated medical staff establishes and implements policies and procedures to ensure that the needs and concerns expressed by members of the medical staff, at each of its separately certified hospitals, regardless of practice or location, are given due consideration, and that the unified and integrated medical staff 
has mechanisms in place to ensure that issues localized to particular hospitals are duly considered and addressed.   Interpretive Guidelines
 §482.22(b)(4)(iv)  
 The hospital’s unified medical staff must have written policies and procedures that address how it considers and addresses needs and concerns expressed by members who practice at the hospital.  This provision is not about an individual medical staff member ’s concerns 
with privileges granted or not granted to him/her, peer review results, due process issues, etc., since these matters are addressed under the requirements at §482.22(a) and (c) as well as §482.22(b)(4)(ii).  Instead, this provision addresses a requirement for the unified medical staff to consider and address concerns that practitioners have concerning their own hospital’s needs.  For example, physicians practicing in a children’s hospital may have concerns about having protocols for medication a dministration that reflect specific pediatric 
patient concerns, or physicians practicing in a small rural hospital may have concerns about 
how to get timely telemedicine consults from their colleagues in urban areas.  
 
The medical staff has flexibility in establishing its written policies and procedures for addressing these local concerns, but at a minimum they must cover the following:  
 
 A process by which members who practice at a hospital can raise their local concerns and needs with the unified medical staff’s leadership;  
 
 How members are informed of the process by which they can raise their local concerns and needs;  
 
 A process for referring the concerns and needs raised to the appropriate committee 
or other group within the medical staff for due consideration; and  
 
 Documentation of the outcome of the medical staff’s review of the concerns and 
needs raised.

medical staff to recommend that the candidate be appointed by the governing body.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.22(c)(4)  
 The medical staff bylaws must describe the qualifications to be met by a candidate for medical staff membership/privileges in order for the medical staff to recommend the candidate be approved by the governing body.  The bylaws must describe the privileging process to be used in the hospital.  The process articulated in the medical staff bylaws must include criteria for determining the privileges that may be granted to individual practitioners and a procedure for applying the criteria to individual practiti oners that 
considers:  
 
• Individual character;  
 
• Individual competence;  
 
• Individual training;  
 
• Individual experience; and  
 
• Individual judgment.  
 
The medical staff may not rely solely on the fact that a MD/DO is, or is not, board- certified 
in making a judgment on medical staff membership.  This does not mean that the medical staff is prohibited from requiring board certification when considering a M D/DO for 
medical staff membership; only that such certification is not the only factor that the hospital considers.  After analysis of all of the criteria, if all criteria are met except for board certification, the medical staff has the discretion to not recommend that individual for medical staff membership/privileges.  
 The bylaws must apply equally to all practitioners in each professional category of practitioners.  
 The medical staff then recommends individual candidates that meet those requirements to the governing body for appointment to the medical staff.  
Survey Procedures §482.22(c)(4)  
 
• Verify that there are written criteria for appointments to the medical staff and 
granting of medical staff privileges.  
 
• Verify that granting of medical staff membership or privileges, is based upon an 
individual practitioner’s meeting the medical staff’s membership/privileging 
criteria.  
 
• Verify that at a minimum, criteria for appointment to the medical staff/granting of medical staff privileges are individual character, competence, training, experience, and judgment. 
 
• Verify that written criteria for appointment to the medical staff and granting of 
medical staff privileges are not dependent solely upon certification, fellowship, or 
membership in a specialty body or society.

 [The bylaws must:]  §482.22(c)(5)  Include a requirement that  --  
  (i)  A medical history and physical examination be completed and documented 
for each patient no more than 30 days before or 24  hours after admission or 
registration, but prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services, and except as provided un der paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.  The medical history and 
physical examination must be completed and documented by a physician (as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act), an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, or other qualified licensed individual in accordance with State law and hospital policy   
 Interpretive Guidelines § 482.22(c)(5)(i)  
 The purpose of a medical history and physical examination (H&P) is to determine whether there is anything in the patient's overall condition that would affect the planned course of the patient's treatment, such as a medication allergy, or a new or existing co -morbid 
condition that requires additional interventions to reduce risk to the patient. 
 
The Medical Staff bylaws must include a requirement that an H&P be completed and documented for each patient no more than 30 days prior to or 24 hours after hospital admission or registration, but prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia servic es 
except when the patient is receiving an outpatient surgical or procedural services and when 
the medical staff has developed and maintained a policy (in accordance with §482.22(c)(5)(v)) that identifies specific patients that do not require a comprehensi ve 
medical H&P, or any update to it, prior to the specific outpatient surgery or procedure.   
 The H&P may be handwritten or transcribed, but always must be placed within the patient’s medical record within 24 hours of admission or registration, or prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services, whichever comes first.  
 An H&P is required prior to surgery and prior to procedures requiring anesthesia services, regardless of whether care is being provided on an inpatient or outpatient basis. (71 FR 68676)  An H&P that is completed within 24 hours of the patient’s admission or registration, but after the surgical procedure, procedure requiring anesthesia, or other procedure requiring an H&P would not be in compliance with this requirement. 
 
The medical history and physical examination must be completed and documented by a 
physician (as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act), oral and maxillofacial surgeon, or other qualified licensed individual in accordance with State law and hospital policy.   Section 1861(r) defines a physician as a:  
 
• Doctor of medicine or osteopathy;  
• Doctor of dental surgery or of dental medicine;  
• Doctor of podiatric medicine;  
• Doctor of optometry; or a  
• Chiropractor.  
 
In all cases the practitioners included in the definition of a physician must be legally authorized to practice within the State where the hospital is located and providing services within their authorized scope of practice.  In addition, in certain instances the Social Security Act attaches further limitations as to the type of hospital services for which a practitioner is considered to be a “physician.”  For example, a chiropractor is considered a physician only with respect to treatment by means of manua l manipulation of the spine (to 
correct a subluxation).  
 Other qualified licensed individuals are those licensed practitioners who are authorized in accordance with their State scope of practice laws or regulations to perform an H&P and who are also formally authorized by the hospital to conduct an H&P.  Other qualified licensed practitioners could include nurse practitioners and physician assistants.  More than one qualified practitioner can participate in performing, documenting, and authenticating an H&P for a single patient.  When performance, documentation, and authentication are split among qualified practitioners, the practitioner who authenticates the H&P will be held responsible for its contents. (71 FR 68675)  
A hospital may adopt a policy allowing submission of an H&P prior to the patient’s hospital admission or registration by a physician who may not be a member of the hospital's medical staff or who does not have admitting privileges at that hospital, or by a  qualified licensed 
individual who does not practice at that hospital but is acting within his/her scope of practice under State law or regulations.  Generally, this occurs where the H&P is completed in advance by the patient’s primary care practitioner. ( 71 FR 68675)  
 
When the H&P is conducted within 30 days before admission or registration, an update 
must be completed and documented by a licensed practitioner who is credentialed and 
privileged by the hospital’s medical staff to perform an H&P. (71 FR 68675) (See discussion of H&P update requirements at 42 CFR 482.22(c)(5)(ii).)  
 
Surveyors should cite noncompliance with the requirements of 42 CFR  
482.22(c)(5) for failure by the hospital to comply with any of this standard's components.  
 Survey Procedures §482.22(c)(5)(i)  
 
• Review the medical staff bylaws to determine whether they require that a physical 
examination and medical history be done for each patient no more than 30 days before 
or 24 hours after admission or registration by a physician (as defined in section 1861(r ) 
of the Act), an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, or other qualified licensed individual in accordance with State law and hospital policy.  Verify whether the bylaws require the H&P be completed prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia service s. 
 
• Review the hospital’s policy, if any, to determine whether other qualified licensed 
individuals are permitted to conduct H&Ps to ensure that it is consistent with the State’s scope of practice law or regulations.  
 
• Verify that non- physicians who perform H&Ps within the hospital are qualified and 
have been credentialed and privileged in accordance with the hospital’s policy. 
 
• Review a sample of inpatient and outpatient medical records that include a variety of 
patient populations undergoing both surgical and non- surgical procedures to verify that:  
 
o There is an H&P that was completed no more than 30 days before or 24 hours after admission or registration, but, in all cases, prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services, except when an assessment is completed and documented pursuant to §482.22(c)(5)(iii); and  
 o The H&P was performed by a physician, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, or other qualified licensed individual authorized in accordance with State law and hospital policy.

 [The bylaws must:]  §482.22(c)(5) -  Include a requirement that  --  
  (ii)  An updated examination of the patient, including any changes in the 
patient's condition, be completed and documented within 24 hours after admission or registration, but prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services, when the medical history and physical examination are completed within 30 days before admission or registration, and except as provided under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.  The updated examination of the patient, including any changes in the patient's condition, must be completed and documented by a physician (as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act), an oral and maxi llofacial surgeon, or other 
qualified licensed individual in accordance with State law and hospital policy. 
 Interpretive Guidelines § 482.22(c)(5)(ii)  
 The Medical Staff bylaws must include a requirement that when a medical history and physical examination has been completed within 30 days before admission or registration, an updated medical record entry must be completed and documented in the patient's medical record within 24 hours after admission or registration, except when the patient is receiving an outpatient surgical or procedural services and when the medical staff has 
developed and maintained a policy (in accordance with §482.22(c)(5)(v)) that identifies specific patients that do not require a comprehensive medical H&P, or any update to it, prior to the outpatient surgery or procedure.  
 The examination must be conducted by a licensed practitioner who is credentialed and privileged by the hospital’s medical staff to perform an H&P.  In all cases, the update must take place prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services.  The update note must document an examination for any changes in the patient's condition since the patient's H&P was performed that might be significant  for the planned course of treatment.  The 
physician or qualified licensed individual uses his/her clinical judgment, based upon his/her assessment of the patient’s condition and co- morbidities, if any, in relation to the patient’s 
planned course of treatment to decide the extent of the update assessment needed as well as the information to be included in the update note in the patient’s medical record.  
  
 
If, upon examination, the licensed practitioner finds no change in the patient's condition 
since the H&P was completed, he/she may indicate in the patient's medical record that the H&P was reviewed, the patient was examined, and that "no change" has occurr ed in the 
patient's condition since the H&P was completed (71 FR 68676).  Any changes in the patient’s condition must be documented by the practitioner in the update note and placed in the patient’s medical record within 24 hours of admission or registrati on, but prior to 
surgery or a procedure requirement anesthesia services.  Additionally, if the practitioner finds that the H&P done before admission is incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise unacceptable, the practitioner reviewing the H&P, examining the patient, and completing the update may disregard the existing H&P, and conduct and document in the medical record a new H&P wi thin 24 hours after admission or registration, but prior to surgery or a 
procedure requiring anesthesia.   Survey Procedures §482.22(c)(5)(ii)  
 
• Review the medical staff bylaws to determine whether they include provisions requiring that, when the medical history and physical examination was completed within 30 days before admission or registration, an updated medical record entry documenting an exa mination for changes in the patient's condition was completed 
and documented in the patient's medical record within 24 hours after admission or registration.  
  
• Determine whether the bylaws require that, in all cases involving surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services, the update to the H&P must be completed and documented prior to the surgery or procedure.  
 
• In the sample of medical records selected for review, look for cases where the 
medical history and physical examination was completed within 30 days before admission or registration.  Verify that an updated medical record entry documenting an examination for any changes in the pat ient's condition was completed and 
documented in the patient's medical record within 24 hours after admission or registration.  Verify that in all cases involving surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services, the update was completed and documented  prior to the surgery 
or procedure.

individual practitioners and a procedure for applying the criteria to individuals 
requesting privileges.  For distant -site physicians and practitioners requesting 
privileges to furnish telemedicine services under an agreement with the hospital, the 
criteria for determining privileges and the procedure for applying the criteria are also subject to the requirements in §482.12(a)(8) and (a)(9), and §482.22(a)(3) and (a)(4).  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.22(c)(6)  
 All patient care is provided by or in accordance with the orders of a physician or practitioner who meets the medical staff criteria and procedures for the privileges granted, who has been granted privileges in accordance with those criteria by the governi ng body, 
and who is working within the scope of those granted privileges.  
 Privileges are granted by the hospital’s governing body to individual practitioners based on the medical staff’s review of that individual practitioner’s qualifications and the medical staff’s recommendations for that individual practitioner to the governi ng body.  However, 
in the case of telemedicine physicians and practitioners providing telemedicine services under an agreement, the governing body has the option of having the medical staff rely upon the credentialing and privileging decisions of the dista nt-site hospital or telemedicine 
entity with which the hospital has entered into an agreement.  When the governing body has exercised this option, the medical staff’s bylaws must include a provision allowing the medical staff to rely upon the credentialing  and privileging decisions of a distant -site 
hospital or telemedicine entity when that distant- site hospital or entity is required under the 
terms of its agreement with the hospital to employ a credentialing and privileging process that conforms to the provisions of §482.12(a)(8) and (a)(9), and §482.22(a)(3) and (a)(4).  
 Survey Procedures §482.22(c)(6)  
 
• Verify that the medical staff bylaws contain criteria for granting, withdrawing, and modifying clinical privileges to individual physicians and practitioners of the 
medical staff and that a procedure exists for applying these criteria.  
 
• In the case of telemedicine physicians and practitioners providing telemedicine 
services under an agreement with the hospital where the hospital’s governing body has opted to have the medical staff rely upon the credentialing and privileging decisions of t he distant -site hospital or telemedicine entity, verify that the bylaws 
include a provision permitting such reliance.

There must be supervisory and staff personnel for each department or nursing unit to ensure, when needed, the immediate availability of a registered nurse for care of any patient.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.23(b)  
 The nursing service must ensure that patient needs are met by ongoing assessments of patients’ needs and provides nursing staff to meet those needs.  There must be sufficient numbers, types and qualifications of supervisory and staff nursing personnel to r espond to 
the appropriate nursing needs and care of the patient population of each department or nursing unit.  There must be a RN physically present on the premises and on duty at all times.  Every inpatient unit/department/location within the hospital- wide nursing service must have 
adequate numbers of RNs physically present at each location to ensure the immediate  
availability of a RN for the care of any patient.  
 A RN would not be considered immediately available if the RN were working on more than one unit, building, floor in a building, or provider (distinct part SNF, RHC, excluded unit, 
etc.) at the same time.  
 
Staffing schedules must be reviewed and revised as necessary to meet the patient care needs and to make adjustments for nursing staff absenteeism.  
 Survey Procedures §482.23(b)

§482.23(b)(1) -  The hospital must provide 24 -hour nursing services furnished or 
supervised by a registered nurse, and have a licensed practical nurse or registered nurse on duty at all times, except for rural hospitals that have in effect a 24- hour 
nursing  waiver granted under §488.54(c)of this chapter.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.23(b)(1)  
 The hospital must provide nursing services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  An LPN can provide nursing services if an RN, who is immediately available for the bedside care of those patients, supervises that care.  
 EXCEPTION : Section 488.54(c) sets forth certain conditions under which rural hospitals of 50 beds or fewer may be granted a temporary waiver of the 24-hour registered nurse requirement by the regional office.  
 Rural is defined as all areas not delineated as “urbanized” areas by the Census Bureau, in the most recent census.  Temporary is defined as a one year period or less and the waiver cannot be renewed.  
 Survey Procedures §482.23(b)(1)  
 
• Review the nurse staffing schedule for a one -week period.  If there are concerns 
regarding insufficient RN coverage, review the staffing schedules for a second week period to determine if there is a pattern of insufficient coverage.  Document daily RN cove rage for every unit of the hospital.  Verify that there is at least one RN for 
each unit on each tour of duty, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.  Additional nurses 
may be required for vacation or absenteeism coverage.  
 
• EXCEPTION:  If the hospital has a temporary waiver of the 24-hour RN 
requirement in effect, verify and document the following: 
 
o 50 or fewer inpatient beds; 
 
o The character and seriousness of the deficiencies do not adversely affect the 
health and safety of patients 
 
o The hospital meets all the other statutory requirements in §1861(e)(1- 8).  
 
o The hospital has made and continues to make a good faith effort to comply with the 24 hour nursing requirement. Determine the recruitment efforts and methods used by the hospitals’ administration by requesting copies of advertisements in newspapers and oth er publications as well as evidence of 
contact with nursing schools and employment agencies.  Document that the salary offered by the hospital is comparable to three other hospitals, located nearest to the facility.  
 
o The hospital’s failure to comply fully with the 24 hour nursing requirement is attributable to a temporary shortage of qualified nursing personnel in the area in which the hospital is located. 
 
o A registered nurse is present on the premises to furnish the nursing service during at least the daytime shift, 7 days a week. 
 
o On all tours of duty not covered by a registered nurse, a licensed practical (vocational) nurse is in charge.

 Survey Procedures §482.23(b)(3)  
 
• Review staffing schedules and assignments. 
 
• Determine that a RN is assigned to supervise and evaluate the nursing care furnished 
to each patient.

§482.23(b)(4) -  The hospital must ensure that the nursing staff develops and keeps 
current a nursing care plan for each patient  that reflects the patient’s goals and the 
nursing care to be provided to meet the patient’s needs.  The nursing care plan may be part of an interdisciplinary care plan.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.23(b)(4)  
 Nursing care planning starts upon admission.  It includes planning the patient’s nursing care to meet the patient’s needs and interventions toward meeting patient treatment goals while in the hospital as well as planning for discharge to meet post -hospital  needs.  A nursing care 
plan is based on assessing the patient’s nursing care needs (not solely those needs related to the admitting diagnosis).  The assessment considers the patient’s treatment goals and, as appropriate, physiological and psychosocial fac tors and patient discharge planning.  The 
plan develops appropriate nursing interventions in response to the identified nursing care needs.  The nursing care plan is kept current by ongoing assessments of the patient’s needs and of the patient’s response t o interventions, assessment of patient treatment goals, and 
updating or revising the patient’s nursing care plan in response to assessments.  The nursing care plan is part of the patient’s medical record and must comply with the medical records requirement s at §482.24.  
 Hospitals have the flexibility of developing the nursing care plan as part of a larger, coordinated interdisciplinary plan of care.  This method may serve to promote communication among disciplines and reinforce an integrated, multi -faceted approach to a 
patient’s care, resulting in better patient outcomes.  The interdisciplinary plan of care does not minimize or eliminate the need for a nursing care plan.  It does, however, serve to promote the collaboration between members of the patient’s health care tea m. 
 
The required documentation for the nursing component of an interdisciplinary care plan 
remains the same.  For other components, the hospital should follow the current documentation policies that it uses to document services provided by other disciplines, s uch 
as services provided by physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech -language 
pathologists, and others.  Documentation should follow the standards of practice for those 
disciplines in addition to any specific requirements that the hospital might want to establish.  
The documentation must also comply with the requirements of the medi cal records 
requirement at §482.24.  (77 FR 29049, May 16, 2012)  
 Survey Procedures §482.23(b)(4)  
 Select a sample of nursing or interdisciplinary care plans.  Approximately 6- 12 plans should 
be reviewed.  For each plan reviewed, with respect to the nursing care component:    
• Was the plan initiated as soon as possible after admission for each patient?  
 
• Does the plan describe and reflect  patient goals as part of the patient’s nursing care assessment and, as appropriate, physiological and psychosocial factors and patient discharge planning?  
 
• Is the plan consistent with the plan for medical care of the practitioner responsible for the care of the patient? 
 
• Is there evidence of reassessment of the patient’s nursing care needs and response to 
nursing interventions and, as applicable, revisions to the plan?  
 
• Was the plan implemented in a timely manner?

§482.23(b)(6) -  All licensed nurses who provide services in the hospital must adhere to 
the policies and procedures of the hospital.  The director of nursing service must provide for the adequate supervision and evaluation of all nursing personnel which occur within the responsibility of the nursing service, regardless of the mechanism through which those personnel are providing services (that is, hospi tal employee, 
contract, lease, other agreement, or volunteer).  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.23(b)(6)  
 The hospital must ensure that there are adequate numbers of clinical nursing personnel to meet its patients nursing care needs.  In order to meet their patient’s needs the hospital may supplement their hospital employed licensed nurses with volunteer and or contract licensed nurses.  
 The hospital and the director of the nursing service are responsible for the clinical activities of all nursing personnel regardless of whether they are hospital employees, contracted staff, or volunteers.  
 All licensed nurses who are working at the hospital must adhere to the policies and procedures of the hospital.  The hospital and the director of the nursing service are responsible for ensuring that licensed nursing personnel know the hospital’s policies and procedures in order to adhere to those policies and procedures.  
 
The hospital and the director of the nursing service ensure that nursing care staff person is adequately supervised and that their clinical activities are evaluated.  This supervision and evaluation of the clinical activities of each non -employee nursing s taff person must be 
conducted by an appropriately qualified hospital -employed RN. 
Survey Procedures §482.23(b)(6)  
 
• Review the method for orienting all licensed nurses to hospital policies and procedures.  The orientation should include at least the following:  
 
o The hospital and the unit;  
 
o Emergency procedures;  
 
o Nursing services policies and procedures; and  
 
o Safety policies and procedures.  
 
• Determine if all nursing personnel are appropriately oriented prior to providing care.  
 
• Confirm with the director of nurses that all nurses performance are evaluated by the 
hospital at least once a year.  If the performance evaluation is not considered 
confidential, review two evaluations.

§482.23(c) Standard: Preparation and Administration of Drugs.  
 (1) Drugs and biologicals must be prepared and administered in accordance with Federal and State laws, the orders of the practitioner or practitioners responsible for the patient’s care, and accepted standards of practice.  
 
(i) Drugs and biologicals may be prepared and administered on the orders of other 
practitioners not specified under §482.12(c) only if such practitioners are acting in accordance with State law, including scope of practice laws, hospital policies, and medical staff bylaws, rules, and regulations….  
 (2)  All drugs and biologicals must be administered by, or under supervision of, nursing or other personnel in accordance with Federal and State laws and regulations, including applicable licensing requirements, and in accordance with the approved medical staff policies and procedures.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §§482.23(c)(1), (c)(1)(i) and (c)(2)  
 According to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, medication errors are among the most common medical errors, harming at least 1.5 million people each year.
4 It 
has been estimated that drug- related adverse outcomes were noted in nearly 1.9 million 
inpatient hospital stays (4.7 percent of all stays), and 838,000 treat -and-release ED visits 
(0.8 percent of all visits) .5  Although technological advances in electronic order entry, 
medication administration, and electronic medical records hold a great deal of promise for decreasing medication errors, there are a multitude of human and environmental factors that will impact their success. The increasing complexity of medical care and patient acuity present significant challenges that require an approach to medication administration that takes advantage of available technology while recognizing that it must be integrated into the medication administration work processes in a manner that meets the needs of patients and promotes their safety.

Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD.  
 
The regulations at §482.23(c) and §482.23(c)(1) promote safety in the preparation and 
administration of drugs and biologicals to hospital patients by requiring preparation and 
administration  in accordance with:  
 
• Federal and State law;  
 
• Accepted standards of practice;  
 
• Orders of the practitioner(s) responsible for the patient’s care, as permitted under State law, hospital policy and medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations; and 
 
• Medical staff -approved policies and procedures. 
 
Federal and State Law  
 Federal law regulates the approval and classification of drugs and biologicals.  Individual States establish laws and regulations which specify the scope of practice for various types of licensed healthcare professionals, including which medications they may prescribe and administer, including controlled substances.  Accepted Standards of Practice  
 Hospital policies and procedures for the preparation and administration of all drugs and biologicals must not only comply with all applicable Federal and State laws, but also must be consistent with accepted standards of practice based on guidelines or recommendations issued by nationally recognized organizations with expertise in  medication preparation and administration.  Examples of such organizations include, but are not limited to:   
• American Society of Health -System Pharmacists ( http://www.ashp.org/default.aspx ) 
• Infusion Nurses Society ( http://www.ins1.org ) 
• Institute for Safe Medication Practices  (www.ismp.org ) 
• National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (www.nccmerp.org
)  
• U.S Pharmacopeia ( www.usp.org ) 
 Orders of an authorized practitioner  
 Drugs must be administered in response to an order from a practitioner, or on the basis of a standing order which is appropriately authenticated subsequently by a practitioner.  (See §482.23(c)(1) (ii) concerning standing orders.)  Generally, the ordering practitioner is the practitioner(s) responsible for the care of the patient.  However, other practitioners not specified under §482.12(c) may write orders for the preparation and administration of drugs and biologicals, if they are acting in accordance with State law, including scope of practice laws, hospital policies and procedures, and medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations.  This includes practitioners ordering outpatient services who do not have privileges in the hospital but who are permitted under their State scope of practice and authorized by hospital and medical staff policy to order outpatient services.  In accordance with standard practice, all practitioner orders for the administration of drugs and biologicals must include at least the following:   
• Name of the patient;  
• Age and weight of the patient, to facilitate dose calculation when applicable.  Policies and procedures must address weight-based dosing for pediatric patients as well as in other circumstances identified in the hospital’s policies.  (Note that dose calculations are based on metric weight (kg, or g for newborns).  If a hospital permits practitioners to record weight in either pounds or using metric weight, the opportunity for error 
increases, since some orders would require conversion while others would not.  
Accordingly, hospitals must specify a uniform approach to be used by prescribing 
practitioners.  For example, a hospital could require all prescribers to use pounds or ounces an d have the electronic ordering system or the pharmacy convert to metric);  
 
• Date and time of the order;  
 
• Drug name;  
 
• Dose, frequency, and route;  
 
• Dose calculation requirements, when applicable;  
 
• Exact strength or concentration, when applicable;  
 
• Quantity and/or duration, when applicable;  
 
• Specific instructions for use, when applicable; and;  
 
• Name of the prescriber.  
 
Medical Staff Approved Policies and Procedures  
 The hospital’s medical staff must approve policies and procedures for medication administration, consistent with the requirements of Federal and State law and accepted standards of practice. It is recommended that the medical staff consult with nurses, pharmacists, Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement program staff, and others 
in developing these policies and procedures. The adopted policies and procedures must address key issues related to medication administration, which include but are not limi ted 
to: 
 Personnel authorized to administer medication  
 §482.23(c)(2) requires that all drugs and biologicals are administered by, or under the supervision of, nursing or other personnel, in accordance with Federal or State law and approved medical staff policies and procedures.  State law requirements include licensure requirements.  Policies and procedures must identify categories of licensed personnel and the types of medications they are permitted to administer, in accordance with state laws.  The policies and procedures must also address education and training for all personnel administering drugs and biologicals.   Medication administration education and training is typically included in hospital orientation or other continuing education for nursing staff and other authorized healthcare personnel.  Training or continuing education topics regarding medication administ ration 
may include but are not limited to the following:  
 
• Safe handling and preparation of  authorized medications;  
 
• Knowledge of the indications, side effects, drug interactions, compatibility,  
and dose limits of administered medications; 
 
• Equipment, devices,  special procedures, and/or techniques required for 
medication administration; 
 Policies and procedures must address the required components of the training and if the training provided during hospital orientation imparts sufficient education or whether ongoing in- services or continuing education will be required to demonstrate compet ence.  
 
Basic safe practices for medication administration  
 
The hospital’s policies and procedures must reflect accepted standards of practice that require the following be confirmed prior to each administration of medication (often referred to as the “five rights” of medication administration practice):   
• Right patient:  the patient’s identity — acceptable patient identifiers include, but are 
not limited to: the patient’s full name; an identification number assigned by the hospital; or date of birth.  Identifiers must be confirmed by patient wrist band, pati ent 
identification card, patient statement (when possible) or other means outlined in the hospital’s policy.  The patient’s identification must be confirmed to be in agreement with the medication administration record and medication labeling prior to medic ation 
administration to ensure that the medication is being given to the correct patient.  
• Right medication:  the correct medication, to ensure that the medication being given to the patient matches that prescribed for the patient and that the patient does not have a documented allergy to it;  
• Right dose:  the correct dose, to ensure that the dosage of the medication matches the prescribed dose, and that the prescription itself does not reflect an unsafe dosage level (i.e., a dose that is too high or too low);  
• Right route:  the correct route, to ensure that the method of administration – orally, intramuscular, intravenous, etc., is the appropriate one for that particular medication and patient; and  
• Right time:  the appropriate time, to ensure adherence to the prescribed frequency and time of administration.  
 NOTE : the “5 rights” focus specifically on the process of administering medications.  
The medication process is generally recognized as consisting of five stages:  ordering/prescribing; transcribing and verifying; dispensing and delivering; administering; and monitoring/reporting.  Errors may occur in other components of the process, even when there is strict adherence to the “5 rights” of medication administration, for example when there has been a prescribing or a dispensing error.  Hospitals are also exp ected to comply with requirements under the Pharmaceutical 
Services CoP at §482.25 and the patient safety requirements under the Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement CoP at §482.21, using a comprehensive systems approach to all components of the medication process.

Recent literature* identifies up to nine “rights” of medication administration including: 
 
 Right patient 
 Right drug 
 Right route 
 Right time  
 Right dose 
 Right documentation 
 Right action (appropriate reason) 
 Right form 
 Right response 
 
However, other sources refer to 8 or 10 “rights, and some of these topics, such as right action, appear to 
involve prescribing and/or dispensing.  Accordingly, there does not (yet) appear to be consensus about 
expanding beyond the 5 “rights.”  
 
*Reference: Elliott, M. and Lis, Y. (2010). The Nine Rights of Medication Administration: An Overview. British 
Journal of Nursing, Vol. 19, 5, 300-305.  
 
 
Hospitals are encouraged to promote a culture in which it is not only acceptable, but also strongly encouraged, for staff to bring to the attention of the prescribing practitioner questions or concerns they have regarding medication orders.  Any questions about orders for drugs or biologicals are expected to be resolved promptly, whether they arise prior to the preparation, dispensing, or administration of the medication. 
 
Hospitals must also ensure staff adherence to accepted standards of practice required to prevent healthcare-associated infections related to medication preparation and/or administration , including compounded sterile preparations (CSPs).  Adherence to these 
standards is assessed under the infection control CoP at 42 CFR 482.42.  
 
A drug or biological is outdated after its expiration date, which is set by the manufacturer based on stability testing under specified conditions as part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval process.  It should be noted that a drug or biological may become unusable prior to its expiration date if it has been subjected to conditions that are inconsistent with the manufacturer’s approved labeling.  A drug or biological is also outdated after its “beyond-use date” (BUD), which may be reached before the expiration date, but never later.  The BUD is the date and time after which the medication must not be used, stored or transported.  The BUD takes into account the specific conditions and potential for deterioration and microbial growth that may occur during or after the original container is opened, while preparing the medication for dispensing and administration, and/or during the compounding process i f it is a 
compounded medication.  The BUD is to be based on information provided by the manufacturer, whenever such information is available.  The hospital must maintain and implement policies and procedures that provide clear and consistent direction to pharmacy staff regarding how to determine a BUD when complete BUD information is not available from the manufacturer.  
  Timing of Medication Administration  Appropriate timing of medication administration must take into account the complex nature and variability among medications; the indications for which they are prescribed; the clinical situations in which they are administered; and the needs of the patients receiving them.  The chemical properties, mechanism of action, or therapeutic goals of some medications require administration at the exact time prescribed, or within a narrow window of its prescribed scheduled time, to avoid compromising patient safety or achievement of the intended therapeutic effect.  However, the therapeutic effect of many other medications is uncompromised by a much broader window of time for administration.  Consequently, the application of a uniform required window of time before or after the scheduled time for the administration of all medications, without regard to their differences, could undermine the ability of nursing staff to prioritize nursing care activities appropriately.  This could also result in staff work -arounds that jeopardize patient safety due to the imposition of 
unrealistic or unnecessary time constraints for medication administration.  Instead, hospital policies and procedures must specifically address the timing of medication administration, based on the nature of the medication and its clinical application, to ensure safe and timely administration.  The policies and procedures must address at least the following:  
• Medications not eligible for scheduled dosing times; 
 
• Medications eligible for  scheduled dosing times;  
 
• Administration of eligible medications outside of their scheduled dosing times and 
windows; and  
• Evaluation of medication administration timing policies, including adherence to them.  
Medications or categories of medication not eligible for scheduled dosing times  
 The policies and procedures must identify medications or categories of medication which are not eligible for scheduled dosing times, either in general or in specific clinical applications.  These are medications that require exact or precise timing of admi nistration, 
based on diagnosis type, treatment requirements, or therapeutic goals.  The policies and procedures must reflect consideration of factors including, but not limited to, the pharmacokinetics of the prescribed medication; specific clinical applications; and patient risk factors.  Examples of medications that hospitals may choose to identify as not eligible for scheduled dosing times may include, but are not limited to:   
• Stat doses (immediate);  
• First time or loading doses (initial large dose of a drug given to bring blood, tissue or fluid levels to an effective concentration quickly);  
• One-time doses; doses specifically timed for procedures; 
 
• Time -sequenced doses; doses timed for serum drug levels; 
 
• Investigational drugs; or  
• Drugs prescribed on an as needed basis (prn doses). 
 The policies and procedures must ensure timely administration of such medications.  In addition they must specify if the policy for the administration of these medications will be applied hospital-wide or only for specific diagnosis types, hospital units or clinical situations.  
 
Medications eligible for  scheduled dosing times  
 Medications eligible for scheduled dosing times are those prescribed on a repeated cycle of frequency, such as once a day, BID (twice a day), TID (three times a day), hourly intervals (every 1, 2, 3 or more hours), etc.  The goal of this scheduling is to achieve and maintain therapeutic blood levels of the prescribed medication over a period of time.  Medication administration policies and procedures typically establish standardized dosing times for the administration of all ‘scheduled’ medications. For example, medications prescribed for BID (twice a day) administration might, under a given hospital’s policies and procedures, be scheduled to be administered at 8am and 8pm.  Another hospital might choose to schedule BID medications at 7:30 am and 7:30 pm.  U se of these standardized times facilitates the 
medication administration process, e.g., by providing to the hospital’s pharmacy  that morning doses of all BID drugs must be dispensed and delivered to patient units in time for the scheduled administration. For the nursing staff, the scheduled administration time might prompt prioritization of additional activities that may be required, in the case of particular 
drugs, such as vital sign assessment or the collection and review of blood work, to ensure 
safe an d timely medication administration.  
Policies and procedures for medications eligible for scheduled dosing times must also address: first dose medications, including parameters within which nursing staff are allowed to use their own judgment regarding the timing of the first and subsequent doses, which may fall between scheduled dosing times; retiming of missed or omitted doses; medications 
that will not follow scheduled dosing times; and patient units that are not subject to 
following the scheduled dosing times.  
 
Time -critical scheduled medications  
 Time -critical scheduled medications are those for which an early or late administration of 
greater than thirty minutes might cause harm or have significant, negative impact on the intended therapeutic or pharmacological effect.  Accordingly, scheduled medi cations 
identified under the hospital’s policies and procedures as time -critical must be administered 
within thirty minutes before or after their scheduled dosing time, for a total window of 1 hour.  It is possible for a given medication to be time - critical for some patients, due to diagnosis, 
clinical situation, various risk factors, or therapeutic intent, but not time -critical for other 
patients.  Therefore, hospital policies and procedures must address the process for determining whether specific scheduled medications are always time- critical, or only under 
certain circumstances, and how staff involved in medication administration will know when a scheduled medication is time -critical.  Examples of time -critical scheduled 
medications/medication types may include, but are not limited to:  
 
• Antibiotics;  
 
• Anticoagulants;  
 
• Insulin;  
 
• Anticonvulsants;   
• Immunosuppressive agents;  
 
• Pain medication (non- IV); 
 
• Medications prescribed for administration within a specified period of time of the medication order;  
 
• Medications that must be administered apart from other medications for optimal therapeutic effect; or  
 
• Medications prescribed more frequently than every 4 hours.  
 Non-time -critical scheduled medications  
 Non-time critical scheduled medications are those for which a longer or shorter interval of 
time since the prior dose does not significantly change the medication’s therapeutic effect or otherwise cause harm.  For such medications greater flexibility in the timing of their administration is permissible.  Specifically:  Medications prescribed for daily, weekly or monthly administration may be within 2 hours before or after the scheduled dosing time, for a total window that does not exceed 4 hours.  
 
• Medications prescribed more frequently than daily but no more frequently than every 4 hours may be administered within 1 hour before or after the scheduled dosing time, for a total window that does not exceed 2 hours.  
 Missed or late administration of medications  
 
The hospital’s policies and procedures must address the actions to be taken when 
medications eligible for scheduled dosing times are not administered within their permitted 
window of time.  This includes doses which may have been missed due to the patient being temporarily away from the nursing unit, for example, for tests or procedures; patient refusal; patient inability to take the medication; problems related to medication availability; or other reasons that result in missed or late dose administration. Likewise, policies and procedures must also outline guidelines for the administration and timing of new medications which are initiated between standardized dosing times.  
 These policies and procedures must identify parameters within which nursing staff are allowed to use their own judgment regarding the rescheduling of missed or late doses and when notification of the physician or other practitioner responsible for the care  of the 
patient is required prior doing so. In either case, the reporting of medication errors that are the result of missed or late dose administration must be reported to the attending physician in accordance with  requirements at §482.25(b)(6).  See int erpretive guidance at 
§482.25(b)(6) for more details on internal reporting requirements  
 Evaluation of medication administration timing policies  
 Hospitals must periodically evaluate their medication administration timing policies, including staff adherence to the policies, to determine whether they assure safe and effective medication administration.  Consistent with the QAPI requirements at 42 CFR  
482.21(c)(2), medication errors related to the timing of medication administration must be tracked and analyzed to determine their causes.  Based on the results of the evaluations of the policies and the medication administration errors, the medical staff  must consider 
whether there is a need to revise the policies and procedures governing medication administration timing.  
 Assessment/Monitoring of Patients Receiving Medications  
 Observing the effects medications have on the patient is part of the multi -faceted 
medication administration process.  Patients must be carefully monitored to determine whether the medication results in the therapeutically intended benefit, and to allow for early 
identification of adverse effects and timely initiation of appropriate corrective action.  Depending on the  medication and route/delivery mode, monitoring may need to include 
assessment of:  
 
• Clinical and laboratory data to evaluate the efficacy of medication therapy, to anticipate or evaluate toxicity and adverse effects.  For some medications, including opioids, this may include clinical data such as respiratory status, blood pressure, and oxygenation and carbon dioxide levels ;  
 • Physical signs and clinical symptoms relevant to the patient’s medication therapy, including but not limited to, somnolence, confusion, agitation, unsteady gait, pruritus, etc.  
 
Certain types of medications are considered inherently high risk for adverse drug events.  Although mistakes may or may not be more common with these drugs, the consequences of errors are often harmful, sometimes fatal, to patients.  (See also the discussi on of high- risk 
medications (typically referred to as “high- alert” medications) in the guidance for 
§482.25(a)(1))  
      
 
 
 
For Information – Not Required/Not to be Cited  
 
The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) makes available a list of high 
alert medications, which it defines as those medications that bear a heightened risk 
of causing significant patient harm when they are used in error.  The current list may 
be found at: 
http://www.ismp.org/Tools/highAlertMedicationLists.asp   
 
 
In addition, certain factors place some patients at greater risk for adverse effects of medication.  Factors including, but not limited to, age, altered liver and kidney function, a history of sleep apnea, patient weight (obesity may increase apnea or smaller patients may be more sensitive to dose levels of medications), asthma, history of smoking, drug-drug interactions, and first- time medication use may contribute to increased risk.  
 Consideration of patient risk factors as well as the risks inherent in a medication must be taken into account when determining the type and frequency of monitoring.  Further, to enhance continuity of care/safe medication administration, it is essential to  communicate all 
relevant information regarding patients’ medication risk factors and monitoring requirements during hand- offs of the patient to other clinical staff, such as when patients are 
transferred internally from one unit to another, during shift r eport at change of shift, etc.  
This would apply to hand-offs involving not only to nursing staff, but also to any other types of staff who administer medications, e.g., respiratory therapists.   Adverse patient reactions, such as anaphylaxis or opioid-induced respiratory depression, require timely and appropriate intervention, per established hospital protocols, and must also be reported immediately to the practitioner responsible for the care of the patient.  (See the guidance for §482.23(c)(5) and §482.25(b)(6), concerning reporting of adverse medication -related events.)  
 An example of vigilant post-medication administration monitoring in the case of a high-alert medication where patient factors may increase risk would be regularly checking vital signs, oxygen level via pulse oximetry, and sedation levels of a post-surgical patient who is receiving pain medication via a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pump.  Narcotic medications, such as opioids, are often used to control pain but also have a sedating effect.  Patients can become overly sedated and suffer respiratory depr ession or arrest, which can 
be fatal.  Timely assessment and appropriate monitoring is essential in all hospital settings in which opioids are administered, to permit intervention to counteract respiratory depression should it occur.  (See also the discussion of the requirements for intravenous medications at §482.23(c)(4)).  As part of the monitoring process, staff are expected to include the patient’s reports of his/her experience of the medication’s effects.  Further, when monitoring requires awakening the patient in order to assess effects of the medications, the patient an d/or the 
patient’s representative must be educated about this aspect of the monitoring process.  In addition, hospitals are encouraged to educate the patient and his/her representative and/or family members about notifying nursing staff promptly when there is difficulty breathing or other changes that might be a reaction to medication.   Hospital policies and procedures are expected to address how the manner and frequency of monitoring, considering patient and drug risk factors, are determined, as well as the information to be communicated at shift changes, including the hospital’s require ments for 
the method(s) of communication.  
Documentation  
 
Note that documentation of medication administration is addressed in the Medical Records CoP, at §482.24(c), which specifies the required content of the medical record.  Within this regulation §482.24(c)(vi) requires that the record contain:  “All practitioners’ orders, nursing notes, reports of treatment, medication records, radiology, and laboratory reports, and vital signs and other information necessary to monitor the patient’s condition.”   Documentation is expected to occur after actual administration of the medication to the patient; advance documentation is not only inappropriate, but may result in medication errors.  Proper documentation of medication admi nistration actions taken and their 
outcomes is essential for planning and delivering future care of the patient.  See the guidance for the various parts of §482.24(c) concerning documentation in the medical record.  Deficiencies in documentation would be c ited under the applicable Medical 
Records regulation.  Survey Procedures §§482.23(c)(1), (c)(1)(i), and (c)(2)  
Verify that there is an effective method for the administration of drugs.  Use the following indicators for assessing drug administration:  
 
• Verify that there are policies and procedures approved by the medical staff and 
governing body concerning ordering of drugs and biologicals by practitioners. 
 
• Verify that there are policies and procedures approved by the medical staff covering 
who is authorized to administer medications, and that the policies are followed.  
 
• Verify nursing staff authorized to administer drugs and biological are 
practicing within their State -permitted scope of practice.  
 
• Are personnel other than nursing personnel administering drugs or biologicals?  If yes, determine if those personnel are administering drugs or biologicals in accordance with Federal and State laws and regulations, including scope of practice laws, hospita l policy, and medical staff by- laws, 
rules and regulations.  Use the above procedures to determine compliance.  
 
• Verify that there are policies and procedures approved by medical staff addressing the 
timing of medication administration.  
 
• Verify that the hospital has, consistent with its policies, identified medications: which 
are: 
 
• not eligible for scheduled dosing times;  
 
• Eligible for scheduled dosing times and are time -critical; and  
 
• Eligible for scheduled dosing times and are not time -critical.  
 
• Verify the hospital has established total windows of time that do not exceed the 
following:  
 
• 1 hour for time -critical scheduled medications;  
 
• 2 hours for medications prescribed more frequently than daily, but no more frequently than every 4 hours; and  
• 4 hours for medications prescribed for daily or longer administration intervals.  
 
• Verify that the hospital’s policy describes requirements for the administration of 
identified time -critical medications.  Is it clear whether time -critical medications or 
medication types are identified as such for the entire hospital or are unit -, patient  
diagnosis -, or clinical situation - specific?  
 
• Review a sample of medical records to determine whether medication administration 
conformed to an authorized practitioner’s order, i.e., that there is an order from an authorized practitioner, or an applicable standing order, and that the correct medication was administered to the right patient at the right dose via the correct route, and that timing of administration complied with the hospital’s policies and procedures.  Check that the practitioner’s order was still in force at the time the drug was administered.  
 
• Observe the preparation of drugs and their administration to patients [medication 
pass] in order to verify that procedures are being followed 
 
• Is the patient’s identity confirmed prior to medication administration?  
 
• Are procedures to assure the correct medication, dose, and route followed?  
 
• Are drugs administered in accordance with the hospital’s established policies 
and procedures for safe and timely medication administration?  
 
• Does the nurse remain with the patient until oral medication is taken?  
 
• Are patients assessed by nursing and/or other staff, per hospital policy, for their 
risk to their prescribed medications?  
  
• Are patients who are at higher risk and/or receiving high- alert medications 
monitored for adverse effects?  
 
• Are staff knowledgeable about intervention protocols when patients experience 
adverse medication -related events?  
 
• Interview personnel who administer medication to verify their understanding of the policies regarding timeliness of medication administration.  
 
• Are they able to identify time -critical and non -time-critical scheduled 
medications?  Medications not eligible for scheduled dosing times?  
 • Are they able to describe requirements for the timing of administration of time 
critical and non -time critical medications in accordance with the hospital’s 
policies?

 Interpretive Guidelines §482.23(c)(1) (ii ),(c)(3) and (c)(3)(iii)  
 All orders for drugs and biologicals, with the exception of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, must be documented and signed by a practitioner who is responsible for the care of the patient, as specified under §482.12(c), or who is another practitioner who is authorized by hospital policy and medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations, and who is acting in accordance with State law, including scope of practice laws.  
 Flu and pneumonia vaccines  
 Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines may be administered per physician -approved hospital 
policy, i.e., hospital policy approved by the physician members of the medical staff.  There must be an assessment of contraindications prior to administration of the vaccine(s).  There is no requirement for authentication by a practitioner when influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are administered to a patient in accordance with hospital policy and State law.   Standing orders  
 Nurses or other personnel authorized by hospital policy and in accordance with State law may administer drugs and biologicals in accordance with pre -printed and electronic 
standing orders, order sets, and protocols for patient orders, collectively referred to in this guidance as “standing orders,” to address well - defined clinical scenarios involving 
medication administration.   The requirements governing the hospital’s development and use of standing orders are found at the Medical Records CoP, under §482. 24(c)(3).  For the 
nursing services requirement under §482.23(c)(1) (ii), compliance assessment focuses on 
whether nurses comply with the hospital’s established standing orders policies and procedures when administering drugs or biological in accordance with a standing order.  
 Survey Procedures §482.23(c)(1) (ii ), (c)(3) and (c)(3)(iii)  
• Review the hospital’s policy for drug and biological orders.  Does it require that all administration of drugs or biologicals be based on either an applicable standing order or the order of a practitioner who is responsible for the care of the patient or otherwise authorized by hospital and medical staff policy and in accordance with State law to write orders?  
 
• Interview nursing staff to determine whether they initiate medications in accordance with standing orders.  Are they familiar with the hospital’s policies and procedures for using standing orders?  Are they following the policies and procedures?  Ask to see the protocol for a standing order used by nursing staff, and ask nursing staff to 
explain how their practice conforms to the protocol.  
• Review a sample of open and closed patient medical records.  Although the regulation applies to both inpatient and outpatient medical records, the sample should be weighted to include more inpatient records. 
 
• Determine whether all orders for drugs and biologicals, with the exception of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, are included in the patient’s medical record 
and authenticated by a practitioner who is authorized to write orders by hospital and medical staff policy and in accordance with State law and who is responsible for the 
care of the patient.  
 
• Determine whether all standing orders which were initiated by a nurse were 
authenticated by an authorized practitioner.  
 
• Determine whether all orders for drugs and biologicals contain the required elements.

(Rev. 95, Issued: 12- 12-13, Effective: 06 -07-13, Implementation: 06- 07-13) 
 §482.23(c)(3)(i) -  If verbal orders are used, they are to be used infrequently.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.23(c)(3)(i)  
 Verbal orders, if used, must be used infrequently. This means that the use of verbal orders must not be a common practice.  Verbal orders pose an increased risk of miscommunication that could contribute to a medication or other error, resulting in a patient adverse event.  Verbal orders should be used only to meet the care needs of the patient when it is impossible or impractical for the ordering practitioner to write the order or enter it into an electronic prescribing system without delaying treatment.  V erbal orders are not to be used 
for the convenience of the ordering practitioner. (71 FR 68679)  
 Hospitals are expected to develop appropriate policies and procedures that govern the use of verbal orders and minimize their use, such as policies which:  
 
• Describe situations in which verbal orders may be used as well as limitations or prohibitions on their use;  
 
• Provide a mechanism to establish the identity and authority of  the practitioner issuing a verbal order;  
 
• List the elements required for inclusion in the verbal order process;  
 
● Establish protocols for  clear and effective communication and verification of verbal 
orders.  
 
The content of verbal orders must be clearly communicated.  CMS expects nationally accepted read -back verification practice to be implemented for every verbal order. (71 FR 
68680)  As required by §482.24(b), all verbal orders must be promptly documented in the 
patient’s medical record by the individual receiving the order.   
 
Survey Procedures §482.23(c)(3)(i)  
 
• Are there policies and procedures in place to minimize the use of verbal orders?  
 
• Interview direct care staff to determine whether actual practice is consistent with verbal order policies and procedures.  
 
• Review both open and closed patient medical records for the use of verbal orders.  
 
• Were the policies and procedures for the use of verbal orders followed?  
 
• Does the number of verbal orders found in the sampled records suggest routine use, which the regulations do not permit?  The number of verbal orders is not in itself evidence of noncompliance, but should result in more focused analysis.  For example:  
 
• Is there a pattern to the use of verbal orders?  Some patterns might make sense – 
e.g., for orders entered between midnight and 7:00 a.m., it might be plausible that it was impossible for the prescribing practitioner to write/computer -enter the 
order.  On the other hand, if one patient care unit has a high proportion of verbal orders, while another does not, this might be a flag for inconsistent implementation of the hospital’s policies and procedures for verbal orders.  
 
• Are verbal orders used frequently for certain types of situations, and if so, is it 
reasonable to assume that it is impossible or impractical for the prescribing practitioners to write/enter the orders in such situations?  
 
• Do certain practitioners use verbal orders frequently?  From the limited number 
of records sampled it may be difficult to detect trends related to specific practitioners, but if a surveyor finds such evidence, further investigation is warranted to determine if it is evidence of noncompliance.

§482.23(c)(4) - Blood transfusions and intravenous medications must be administered 
in accordance with State law and approved medical staff policies and procedures.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.23(c)(4)  
 
Intravenous (IV) medications and blood transfusions must be administered in accordance with State law and approved medical staff policies and procedures.  Further, many of the medications included in the high- alert categories are administered intravenously.  (See also 
the discussion of high- risk/high- alert medications in the guida nce for §482.25(b).)  Hospital 
policies and procedures for blood transfusions and IV medications must be based on accepted standards of practice, and must address at least the following:  
 Vascular Access Route  
 Patients may require a form of vascular access to deliver blood or medications, either venous or arterial, based on the desired treatment plan.  Safe administration of blood transfusions and IV medications includes the correct choice of vascular access.  IV medications, such as fluids, antibiotics, and chemotherapy, may require specific types of access, such as peripheral or central catheters versus implanted port devices, based on the medication’s chemical properties or safety concerns.  Hospital policies and procedures must address whi ch medications can be given intravenously via what type of access. 
 Other Patient Safety Practices  
 In addition to the basic safe practices that apply to all medication administration (See the discussion of safe medication administration practices, and medication administration in general, at §482.23(c)), there are additional safe practices specific to I V medication 
administration that require consideration, including but not limited to, the following:  
 
• Tracing invasive lines and tubes prior to administration to ensure the medication is to be 
administered via the proper route (for example, peripheral catheter versus epidural catheter connections);  
 
• Avoiding forcing connections when the equipment offers clear resistance;  
 
• Verifying proper programming of infusion devices (concentrations, flow rate, dose rate).  
 Patient Monitoring  
 As discussed in the medication administration guidance for §§482.23(c)(1), (c)(1)(i ) and 
(c)(2), patients must be monitored for the effects of medications.  To the extent that IV medications have a more rapid effect on the body, it is important that staff administering medications understand each medication and its monitoring requirement s.  Policies and 
procedures for IV medication administration must address appropriate IV medication monitoring requirements, including assessment of patients for risk factors that would influence the type and frequency of monitoring.  
 
For example: a 50 year old patient with a history of renal failure is receiving IV vancomycin to treat a wound infection.  The hospital policy for IV antibiotics, including vancomycin, requires the patient’s kidney function to be monitored daily with blood draws.  Based on review of the lab results, a practitioner responsible for the care of the patient would be expected to determine on a timely basis whether or not the antibiotic dose needs to be adjusted to protect kidney function or prevent drug toxicity while achieving the desired therapeutic effects.  Staff administering the medication would be expected to review the lab results as well, and to raise with a practitioner responsible for 
the care of the patient any concerns they might have about whether a n adjustment in the 
medication is needed.  
  
Hospital policies and procedures related to monitoring patients receiving IV medications are expected to address, but are not limited to, the following:  
 
• Monitoring for Fluid  & Electrolyte Balance  
 
Whenever IV medications and blood transfusions are administered, the patient may become at risk for fluid and electrolyte imbalance.  Hospital policies and procedures must address monitoring and treatment for fluid and electrolyte imbalances that may occur  with blood transfusions and IV medications.  
 
• Monitoring Patients Receiving High -alert Medications, Including IV Opioids  
 
Policies and procedures related to IV medication administration must address those medications the hospital has identified as high- alert medications and the monitoring 
requirements for patients receiving such drugs intravenously.  
 At a minimum, hospitals are expected to address monitoring for over -sedation and 
respiratory depression related to IV opioids for post -operative patients  
 Opioids are a class of medication used frequently in hospitals to treat pain.  The sedating effects of opioids make it difficult at times to properly assess the patient’s level of sedation.  It can be erroneously assumed that patients are asleep when they are actually exhibiting progressive symptoms of respiratory compromise -  somnolence, 
decreased respiratory rate, and decrease in oxygen levels.  These symptoms, if 
unrecognized, can progress to respiratory depression and even death.  
 Certain characteristics, in addition to those discussed in the medication administration guidance for §§482.23(c)(1), (c)(1)(i) and (c)(2),  place patients receiving opioids at 
higher risk for oversedation and respiratory depression.  These additional factors include, but are not limited to
6: 
 
• Snoring or history of sleep apnea  
• No recent opioid use or first -time use of IV opioids  
• Increased opioid dose requirement or opioid habituation  
• Longer length of time receiving general anesthesia during surgery  
• Receiving other sedating drugs, such as benzodiazepines, antihistamines, sedatives, 
or other central nervous system depressants  
• Preexisting pulmonary or cardiac disease  
• Thoracic or other surgical incisions that may impair breathing  
 
Of particular concern are patients receiving IV opioids post -operatively.  The 
effects of IV opioids in post -operative patients must be monitored vigilantly via serial 
assessments of pain, respiratory status, and sedation levels.  
 
Hospitals must have policies and procedures related to the use of high- alert medications, 
including IV opioids for post -operative patients.  Policies and procedures must address, 
at a minimum, the process for patient risk assessment, including who conducts  the 
assessments, and, based on the results of the assessment, monitoring frequency and 
duration, what is to be monitored, and monitoring methods.  The policies and procedures must also address whether and under what circumstances practitioners

Monitoring for Opioid- Induced Sedation and Respiratory Depression. Pain Management Nursing, Vol  12, 
No. 3 (September), 2011: pp 118 -145 
 
 
prescribing IV opioids are allowed to establish protocols for IV opioid administration and monitoring that differ from the hospital -wide policies and procedures.  
 The frequency of the serial assessments and duration of the monitoring timeframe for post-operative patients receiving IV opioids must be determined based on at least the 
following considerations :  
 
• Patient risk for adverse events;  
• Opioid dosing frequency and IV delivery method. (push or patient -controlled 
analgesia (PCA));  
• Duration of IV opioid therapy.  
 Regardless of the above factors, at a minimum monitoring must include the following:  
 
• Vital signs  (blood pressure, temperature, pulse, respiratory rate)  
• Pain level;  
• Respiratory status;  
• Sedation level;  sedation levels are important indicators for the clinical effects of 
opioids. Sedation is a useful assessment parameter to observe the effects of opioids since sedation typically precedes respiratory depression
7.   See the blue box below 
for information on sedation assessment methods.  
 
 In addition to vigilant nursing assessment at appropriate intervals, hospitals may choose to use technology to support effective monitoring of patients’ respiratory rate and oxygen 
levels.  
 
For additional information regarding recommendations of expert organizations on post -
operative opioid monitoring, including technology- supported monitoring, see blue boxes 
below.  The practices described in the blue boxes below are not required under the 
regulations. 
 
The assessment and monitoring process must be explained to the patient and/or the patient's 
representative, to communicate the rationale for vigilant monitoring, including that it might be necessary to awaken the patient in order to assess effects of the m edications.   In 
addition, hospitals are encouraged to educate the patient and his/her representative and/or family members about notifying nursing staff promptly when there is difficulty breathing or 
other changes that might be a reaction to medication.

PSMF recommends all patients receiving IV opioids have continuous measure-
through motion and low perfusion pulse oximetry, and that patients on 
supplemental oxygen also have continuous respiration rate monitoring.   It also 
calls for the monitoring system to be linked with a notification system to clinical 
staff who can respond immediately.  It calls for an escalation protocol so that if a 
staff person does not acknowledge the alert in 60 seconds a second person will be 
notified.

Adverse patient reactions require timely and appropriate intervention, per established 
protocols, and must also be reported immediately to the practitioner responsible for the care of the patient.  (See the guidance for §482.23(c)(5) and §482.25(b)(6), concerning reporting of adverse medication -related events.)

• APSF calls for every patient receiving postoperative opioid analgesics to be managed 
based on the following clinical considerations*:  
• Individualize the dose and infusion rate of opioid while considering 
the unique aspects of each patient’s history and physical status. 
• Make continuous monitoring of oxygenation (pulse oximetry) the 
routine rather than the exception. 
• Assess the need for supplemental oxygen, especially if pulse 
oximetry or intermittent nurse assessment are the only methods of 
identifying progressive hypoventilation.  
• When supplemental oxygen is indicated, monitoring of ventilation 
may warrant the use of technology designed to assess breathing or 
estimate arterial carbon dioxide concentrations. Continuous 
monitoring is most important for the highest risk patients, but 
depending on clinical judgment, should be applied to other 
patients.

like IV medications, blood transfusions are not without risk of harm to patients.  
Transfusion reactions and/or errors can be fatal.  
  In addition to the safe practices and other safety considerations that apply to all IV medication administration, policies and procedures must address blood administration procedures that are consistent with accepted standards of transfusion practice, incl uding but 
not limited to:  
 
• Confirming the following prior to each blood transfusion:  
 
• the patient’s identity  
• verification of the right blood product for the right patient  
 The standard of practice calls for two qualified individuals, one of whom will be administering the transfusion, to perform the confirmation. 
 
• Requirements for patient monitoring, including frequency and documentation of 
monitoring  
 
• How to identify, treat, and report any adverse reactions the patient may experience 
during or related to transfusion.  
 Staff Training and Competencies  
 Intravenous (IV) medications and blood transfusions must be administered by qualified 
personnel, regardless of whether they are practitioners or non- practitioners.  Generally IV 
medications and blood transfusions are administered to patients by registered nurses (RNs), consistent with State law governing scope of practice, and approved medical staff policies and procedures.  
 Among other things, personnel must be able to demonstrate competency in venipuncture, in accordance with State law and hospital policy.  If other types of vascular access are utilized, staff must have demonstrated competency in appropriate usage, care, and maintenance.  
Staff must also be trained in early detection of and timely intervention for IV opioid-induced over -sedation and respiratory depression.  
 Education and training regarding these procedures are typically included in the nurse’s hospital orientation.  Nursing staff who receive training for intravenous medication 
administration and/or blood transfusion administration during hospital orientation or during 
other continuing education programs would meet the requirements of this regulation.  Content of the training must address each required component of the approved medical staff policies and procedures.  
 Other non- practitioners, for example, licensed practical nurses or licensed vocational 
nurses, with demonstrated competence may also administer IV medications and blood transfusions if they are acting in accordance with State law, including scope of practi ce law, 
and the hospital’s approved medical staff policies and procedures. (77 FR 29050, May 16, 2012)  
  For non- practitioners, the appropriate competencies must be documented in the qualified 
staff person’s employee record.  
 All State law and scope of practice requirements must be met regarding the administration of intravenous medications and blood transfusions, as applicable.  
 
 
 
Survey Procedures §482.23(c)(4)  
 
• Interview nursing staff on different units who administer IV medications and blood 
transfusions.  Are staff knowledgeable with respect to:  
• Venipuncture techniques;  
 
• Safe medication administration practices, including general practices applying to all types of medications  and practices concerning IV tubing and infusion pumps;  
 
• Maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance;  
 
• Patient assessment for risk related to IV medications and appropriate 
monitoring;  
 
• Early detection and intervention for IV opioid- induced respiratory depression in 
post-operative patients;  
 
• With respect to blood transfusions:  
 
• Blood components;  
 
• Process for verification of the right blood product for the right patient; 
and 
 
• Transfusion reactions:  identification, treatment, and reporting requirements.  
• Review the files for a sample of staff who administer blood products and IV medications, for evidence that competency was assessed and training was provided as appropriate.  
 
• If able, observe blood transfusion and IV medication administration to assess staff adherence to accepted standards of practice.  
 
o Were safe medication administration practices used? 
o Was the transfused patient correctly identified and matched to the correct blood product prior to administration?  
o Was the appropriate access used for IV medications? 
o Were appropriate steps taken with regard to IV tubing and infusion pumps?  
o Are patients being monitored post -infusion for adverse reactions?  
 
• If staff appear to not be following accepted standards of practice for patient risk 
assessment related to IV medications, particularly opioids, and appropriate monitoring 
of patients receiving IV medications and/or blood transfusions, review policies and procedures for IV medication administration and blood transfusion to determine if they 
address safe practices considerations.  
 
• Review a sample of medical records.   
o Are blood transfusions and IV medications administered in accordance with 
State law and approved medical staff policies and procedures?  
 
• Are blood transfusions and IV medications administered by personnel who are working within their scope of practice in accordance with State law and approved medical staff policies?

(Rev. 200, Issued: 02- 21-20; Effective: 02 -21-20, Implementation: 02- 21-20) 
 
§482.23(c)(5) -  There must be a hospital procedure for reporting transfusion reactions, 
adverse drug reactions, and errors in administration of drugs.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.23(c)(5)  
 
Adverse drug reactions and drug administration errors  
 There is a similar but more detailed and prescriptive requirement concerning internal hospital reporting of adverse drug reactions, drug administration errors and incompatibilities under the Pharmaceutical Services CoP at §482.25(b)(6).  Therefore, it is not necessary for hospitals to establish a different procedure in the case of adverse drug reactions and drug administration errors for such events when nurses administer drugs or transfusions.  Consult the guidance for §482.25(b)(6) to see what must be reported, to whom, and in what timeframe.  Failure to make required reports concerning adverse drug reactions and errors in administration of drugs should be cited under §482.23(c)(5) when the drug was administered by a nurse, as well as under §482.25(b)(6).  
 Transfusion reactions  
 Transfusion reactions can occur during or after a blood transfusion.  A patient’s immune system recognizes the foreign blood product and attempts to destroy the transfused cells.  Incompatible blood products are typically the cause of transfusion reactions .  Symptoms 
may include back pain, bloody urine, hives, chills, fainting, dizziness, fever, flank pain, and skin flushing.  More serious complications may include acute kidney failure, anemia, respiratory distress, shock and even death.  
 Transfusion reactions are serious and can be life -threatening.  The hospital must have 
policies and procedures in place for the internal reporting of transfusion reactions.  The policies must include procedures for reporting transfusion reactions immediate ly to the 
practitioner responsible for the care of the patient.  The transfusion reaction must also be 
reported to the hospital -wide quality assessment performance improvement program as an 
adverse event, in accordance with the QAPI CoP at 42 CFR 482.21(c) (2).  The transfusion 
reaction must be documented in the patient’s medical record, including the prompt notification of the responsible practitioner.  
 Survey Procedures §482.23(c)(5)  
 
• For adverse drug events and medication administration errors, follow the survey procedures for §482.25(b)(6).  Deficiencies are to be cited under both §482.23(c)(5)and §482.25(b)(6) when the drug or transfusion related to an adverse drug reaction, transfusion reaction or medication administration error relates to a drug or transfusion administered by a nurse.  
 
• Request the hospital policy and procedure for internal reporting of transfusion reactions.  
 
• Interview nursing staff responsible for administering blood transfusions to 
determine whether they are familiar with and comply with the hospital’s policies. 
 
• Ask to see if there are any transfusion -related incident reports.  Is there evidence 
that the transfusion reaction was reported immediately to the practitioner 
responsible for the patient’s care?  Was it reported to the hospital’s QAPI program?  
 
A-0412  
(Rev. 116, Issued: 06- 06-14 Effective: 06 -06-14, Implementation 06- 06-14) 
 
§482.23(c)(6) The hospital may allow a patient (or his or her caregiver/support person 
where appropriate) to self - administer both hospital -issued medications and the 
patient’s own medications brought into the hospital, as defined and specified in the hospital’s policie s and procedures.  
 
(i) If the hospital allows a patient to self -administer specific hospital- issued 
medications, then the hospital must have policies and procedures in place to:  
 
(A) Ensure that a practitioner responsible for the care of the patient has issued an order, consistent with hospital policy, permitting self -administration.  
 (B) Assess the capacity of the patient (or the patient’s caregiver/support person where appropriate) to self -administer the specified medication(s).  
 (C) Instruct the patient (or the patient’s support person where appropriate) in the safe and accurate administration of the specified medication(s). 
 (D) Address the security of the medication(s) for each patient. 
 (E) Document the administration of each medication, as reported by the patient (or the patient’s caregiver/support person where appropriate), in the patient’s medical record.  
 
Interpretative Guidelines §482.23(c)(6)(i)  
 Hospitals have the option of establishing a program for self -administration by patients, or, 
when applicable, patient caregivers or support persons, of hospital -issued medications.  The 
existence of this regulatory option does not mean that a hospital must  offer medication self -
administration programs or that a patient has a right to self -administer their medications.  
 A hospital program for patient self -administration of hospital- issued medications could be 
beneficial for the appropriate patients if the proper precautions are taken in designing and implementing such a program.  Generally such a program would apply only to inpatients, but there may be circumstances under which a hospital finds it appropriate to permit self -
administration of hospital -issued medications by outpatients or their caregivers/support 
persons.  
 Among the potential benefits of medication self -administration, teaching patients or their 
caregivers/support persons adherence to the proper medication regimen could reduce hospital inpatient length of stay and also might have a positive effect on continued compliance with the regimen after discharge, potentially avoiding an emergency department visit or inpatient readmission secondary to post -hospital patient medication administration 
errors and noncompliance.  Hospitals have the discretion to establish policies providing for different levels of patient self-administration, and may make these levels across -the-board, patient -specific, or 
medication -specific.  For example, a hospital may choose whether or not a nurse must be 
present to supervise the self -administration, and whether this supervision requirement could 
vary according to the type of medication or the capacity of the individual patient (or the patient’s caregiver/support person).  A hospital may also de termine through its policies and 
procedures whether supervision requirements must be addressed in the practitioner’s order or whether this may be left to the discretion of the nurse who assesses the patient.  A hospital may choose to exclude certain medica tions from patient self -administration, for  
 
example, because they pose too great a medication security challenge, or because the 
manner in which they must be administered does not lend itself to safe self -administration.  
(77 FR 29052, May 16, 2012)     It must be clear in the hospital’s policies and procedures whether it has established such a policy and what kind of limitations it has established for its program of patient self -administration of hospital -issued medications.  
 It is expected that the medical staff, nursing and pharmacy departments are to collaborate in developing policies and procedures governing self -administration of hospital -issued 
medications which are approved by the governing body.  Required elements of a self -administration program:  
 If the hospital chooses to develop programs for self -administration of hospital -issued 
medications by patients (and/or their caregiver/support persons), the following must be in place:  
 
• An order allowing the patient to administer hospital -issued medications .  The 
order must be consistent with the hospital’s policy concerning self -administration of 
hospital -issued medications and be written by a practitioner who is responsible for 
the care of the patient and who is authorized to order medications, in accordance with hospital policies and procedures, State law, including scope of practice laws, and medical staff by -laws, rules, and regulations.   
 
• A documented assessment of the capacity of the patient (or their caregiver/support person) to successfully administer medications for which self-administration has been authorized.  Nurses are expected to exercise their 
clinical judgment and to inform the practitioner responsible for the care of the patient about any reservations the nurse might have about an individual patient’s (or caregiver/support person’s) capacity to safely self -administer medications.  The 
assessment must be documented and must highl ight the findings that are affirmative 
– i.e., support patient -self-administration – and negative – i.e., call into question 
patient self -administration.  The nurse is also expected to document any discussions 
with the practitioner responsible for the care  of the patient regarding the nurses’ 
concerns about patient’s (or caregiver/support person’s) capacity to safely self -
administer medications.  Hospitals may, as a matter of policy, permit a nurse to return to nurse administration for particular doses of a  medication for which there is 
a self -administration order, without a discussion with the responsible practitioner if, 
based on the nurse’s assessment, the patient’s capacity has been temporarily diminished and there is no caregiver/support person who is a ssisting the patient with 
self-administration of medication.   For example, a patient who has just had an 
invasive test or procedure may not be fully alert for a period thereafter, or the parent of a minor patient, who is administering medications to the patient may for whatever reasons not be available and a scheduled medication dose is close to being overdue.   
 
• Instruction in self -administration.  As part of the assessment of the patient’s self -
administration capacity, nurses are expected to identify the patient’s (or the patient’s caregiver/support person’s) education and/or training needs.  These needs may be related to type of medication, unique individual medication requirements, delivery route, dosage and scheduling, equipment (e.g. syringes, pill -cutters, measuring 
containers, etc.) intravenous access, potential adverse side effects and what to do if they oc cur, infection control measures, storage, medication disposal, among 
others.  Education and training needs, and how they were addressed, must be documented in the medical record.
 
 
• Security of the self -administered medications.  The security of a patient’s self -
administered medications is extremely important, but does not lend itself well to a 
one-size-fits-all regulatory requirement.  There are Federal and State laws, including 
the Pharmaceutical Services CoP, which require a higher level of security for certain 
medications (for example, controlled substances).  Hospitals are expected to comply with these already -established requirements and laws, and generally should not 
include such medications as part of a patient self -administration program.  
 
 
• Note that Patient- controlled Analgesia (PCA) pumps are a special variant of patient 
self-administration.  Such pumps allow patients, within tightly controlled, pre -
determined parameters with respect to dosage and minimum time intervals between doses, to re lease an intravenous dose of a controlled substance pain medication that 
has been pre -loaded into the PCA pump in a manner that prevents tampering by an 
unauthorized person.  PCA pumps are considered secure despite their use of controlled substances.  
 PCA pumps allow for the self -administration of intravenous (IV) medications to 
patients.  See the interpretive guidelines for §482.23(c)(4) concerning assessment and monitoring requirements for  post -surgical patients receiving IV opioids, including via 
patient- controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps, in and out of the post -anesthesia care and 
intensive care units.    Hospitals are also free to exclude other medications besides controlled substances from their patient self -administered medication programs when the hospital has concerns 
over its capacity to address the safety and security of these other medications for patients.  
 
A hospital may choose to have a policy where it maintains a list of medications that it excludes from self -administration entirely, due to security concerns.  It may choose to 
have a policy that addresses the security of a particular medication on a patien t-by-
patient basis.  Or it may establish a policy that is a combination of both of these approaches to medication security.  (77 FR 29052, May 16, 2012)
 
 
• Documentation of medication administration.  Under the regulation, a nurse must document the self -administration of a medication.  In cases where the nurse directly 
supervised the self -administration, the nurse is expected to indicate that the 
medication administration was observed and confirmed.  On the other hand, where direct nurse supervision is not required, the nurse is required to document only what the patient, or the patient’s caregiver/support person, reports to the nurse as to the time and amount of medication administered.  Nurses are expected to assess whether the reports of the patient or patient’s caregiver/support person indicate, with respect to timing and dosage, that the patient is receiving the medication as ordered. 
 Survey Procedures §482.23(c)(6)(i)  
 If the hospital permits patient self -administration of hospital -issued medications:  
 
• Ask the hospital to identify current inpatients for whom self -administration of 
hospital -issued medications is permitted.  
 
• Interview of several of these patients (or their caregivers/support persons when 
applicable) to verify that they received instruction on how to administer their medications  
 
• Interview nurses caring for the selected patients.   Ask them:  
 
• What the applicable hospital policies and procedures are regarding supervision 
of self -medication.  
 
• How they assess a patient’s (or patient’s caregiver/support person’s) capacity to 
self-administer medication.  If they have concerns, how do they communicate 
them to the responsible practitioner?  Does their hospital permit nurses to return 
to nurse admini stration of medications in response to temporary reduction in 
patient capacity or absence of the patient’s caregiver/support person?  If so, how do the nurses make this assessment?  
 
• How they instruct a patient (or patient’s caregiver/support person’s) in 
medication self -administration.  
 
• How self -administered medications are secured.  
 • How they document self -administration of medications.  
 • To provide a copy of the hospital’s policies and procedures.  Are they following 
the policies and procedures?  
 
• Review the medical records for the selected patients.  Is there documentation of:  
 
• An order for self -administration of specific medication(s).  
 • A nurse assessment of the patient’s (or patient’s caregiver/support person’s) 
capacity to self -administer medication.   
 
• Documentation of nurse instruction to the patient or (or patient’s 
caregiver/support person) in safe and appropriate techniques for self -
administration of medication.  
 
• Documentation of self -administration times and doses, as reported by the patient 
or (or patient’s caregiver/support person) or directly observed by a nurse.  
 
• Do the hospital’s policies and procedures for self -administration of hospital -issued 
medications address:  
 
• Limitations on medications not eligible for self -administration or patient 
conditions which exclude self -administration; 
 • Orders for self- administration of medication; 
 • Requirements, if any, for supervision of self -administration; 
 • Assessment of self -medication capacity;  
 • Instruction in self -medication; 
 • Security of self -administered medications; and  
 • Documentation of self -administration.

Interpretative Guidelines §482.23(c)(6)(ii)  
 Hospitals have the option of establishing a program for self -administration by patients, or, 
when applicable, patient caregivers or support persons, of medications the patient brings himself or herself to the hospital.  The existence of this regulatory opt ion does not mean 
that a hospital must offer medication self -administration programs or that a patient has a 
right to retain and self -administer medications they bring with them from home.  
 A hospital program for patient self -administration of medications the patient brings from 
home could be beneficial for the appropriate patients if the proper precautions are taken in designing and implementing such a program.  Generally such a program woul d apply only 
to inpatients, but there may be circumstances under which a hospital finds it appropriate to permit self -administration of medications that outpatients or their caregivers/support 
persons bring with them.    
Among the potential benefits of permitting self -administration of medications the patient 
brings from home is that problems are avoided related to the hospital’s formulary not including a particular medication that a patient needs to continue to take during his/her hospital stay, and the patient prefer to avoid medication substitution.  The hospital also gains an opportunity to identify suboptimal patient medication administration techniques for these drugs and to provide instruction designed to ensure that  the patient is 
administering his/her medications properly.  
 Hospitals have the discretion to establish policies providing for different levels of patient self-administration, and may make these levels across -the-board, patient -specific, or 
medication -specific.  For example, a hospital may choose whether or not a nurse must be 
present to supervise the self -administration, and whether this supervision requirement could 
vary according to the type of medication or the capacity of the individual patient (or the

medication(s).  Nurses are expected to exercise their clinical judgment and to inform the practitioner responsible for the care of the patient about any reservations the nurse might have about an individual patient’s (or caregiver/support person’s) capacity to safely self -administer medications.

 Hospitals may, as a matter of policy, permit a nurse to return to nurse administration for particular doses of a medication for which there is a self -administration order, without a 
discussion with the responsible practitioner if, based on the nurse’s asse ssment, the 
patient’s capacity has been temporarily diminished and there is no caregiver/support person who is assisting the patient with self -administration of medication.   For 
example, a patient who has just had an invasive test or procedure may not be fully alert for a period thereafter, or the parent of a minor patient, who is administering medications to the patient may for whatever reasons not be available and a scheduled medication dose is close to being overdue.   
 
As part of the assessment of the patient’s self -administration capacity, nurses are 
expected to identify whether the patient (or the patient’s caregiver/support person) needs instruction in the safe and accurate administration of the specified medication(s).  Even though the patient has been taking the medication at home, the patient (or the patient’s caregiver/support person) may not be using optimal administration techniques.  Patient needs may be related to type of medication, unique individual medication requirements, delivery route, dosage and scheduling, equipment (e.g. syringes, pill -cutters, measuring containers, etc.) intravenous access, potential adverse 
side effects and what to do if they occur, infection control measures, storage, medication disposal, among others.  Education and training needs identified, and how they were addressed, must be documented in the medical record.
 
 
• Identification/visual evaluation for integrity.  Hospitals must have policies and 
procedures addressing how they will identify the medications the patient has brought 
from home.  Identification is important because the label on the patient’s medication 
container may not accurately reflect the contents.  Further, the medication might have expired or have not been stored correctly in the patient’s home, requiring hospitals to at least conduct a visual inspection to see if the medication appears to have retained its integrity.   It is recognized that a visual inspection for integrity may not be definitive, but the regulation does not require use of more complex methods. 
 
• Security of the self -administered medications.  The security of a patient’s self -
administered medications is extremely important, but does not lend itself well to a one -

§482.24(b) Standard:  Form and Retention of Record  
 The hospital must maintain a medical record for each inpatient and outpatient.  Medical records must be accurately written, promptly completed, properly filed and retained, and accessible.  The hospital must use a system of author identification and record  maintenance that ensures the integrity of the authentication and protects the 
security of all record entries.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.24(b)  
 The hospital must maintain a medical record for each inpatient and outpatient evaluated or treated in any part or location of the hospital. All medical records must be accurately written .  The hospital must ensure that all medical 
records accurately and completely document all orders, test results, evaluations, care plans, treatments, interventions, care provided and the patient’s response to those treatments, interventions and care.  
 All medical records must be promptly completed . Every medical record must be complete 
with all documentation of orders, diagnosis, evaluations, treatments, test results, care plans, 
discharge plans, consents, interventions, discharge summary, and care provided along with 
the patient’s response to those treatments, interventions, and care.  The record must be completed promptly after discharge in accordance with State law and hospital policy but no later than 30 days after discharge.  
 The medical record must be properly filed and retained .  The hospital must have a 
medical record system that ensures the prompt retrieval of any medical record, of any patient evaluated or treated at any location of the hospital within the past 5 years. [  §482.24(b)(1) addresses the 5 year medical record ret ention requirement]  
 
The medical record must be accessible.  The hospital must have a medical record system 
that allows the medical record of any patient, inpatient or outpatient, evaluated and/or treated at any location of the hospital within the past 5 years to be accessible by appropriate staff, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, whenever that medical record may be needed.  
 Medical records must be properly stored in secure locations where they are protected from fire, water damage and other threats.  
 Medical information such as consultations, orders, practitioner notes, x- ray interpretations, 
lab test results, diagnostic test results, patient assessments and other patient information must be accurately written, promptly completed and properly filed in the patients’ medical record, and accessible to the physicians or other care providers when needed for use in making assessments of the patient’s condition, decisions on the provision of care to the patient, and in planning the patient’s care.  This requir ement applies to the medical records 
of current inpatients and outpatients of the hospital.  The hospital must have a system of author identification and record maintenance that ensures the integrity of the authentication and protects the security of all  record entries.  
The medical record system must correctly identify the author of every medical record entry 
and must protect the security of all medical record entries.  The medial record system must ensure that medical record entries are not lost, stolen, destroyed, altered, or reproduced in an unauthorized manner.  Locations where medical records  are stored or maintained must 
ensure the integrity, security and protection of the records.  These requirements apply to both manual and electronic medical record systems.  Survey Procedures §482.24(b)  
 
• Determine the location(s) where medical records are maintained.  
 
• Verify that a medical record is maintained for each person treated or receiving care.  
The hospital may have a separate record for both inpatients and outpatients.  However, when two different systems are used they must be appropriately cross referenced an d accessible.  
 
• Verify that procedures ensure the integrity of authentication and protect the security of patient records.  
 
• Verify that medical records are stored and maintained in locations where the records are secure, that protects them from damage, flood, fire, etc., and limits access to only authorized individuals. 
 
• Verify that records are accurate, completed promptly, easily retrieved and readily accessible, as needed, in all locations where medical records are maintained.

§482.24(b)(3) -  The hospital must have a procedure for ensuring the confidentiality of 
patient records.  Information from or copies of records may be released only to authorized individuals, and the hospital must ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot  gain access to or alter patient records.  Original medical records must be 
released by the hospital only in accordance with Federal or State laws, court orders, or subpoenas . 
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.24(b)(3)  
 Release of Information from or Copies of Records:  
 The hospital must have a procedure to ensure the confidentiality of each patient’s medical record, whether it is in paper or electronic format, or a combination of the two, from unauthorized disclosure.   Confidentiality applies wherever the record or port ions thereof 
are stored, including but not limited to central records, patient care locations, radiology, 
laboratories, record storage areas, etc.  
 
A hospital is permitted to disclose medical record information, without a patient’s authorization, in order to provide patient care and perform related administrative functions, such as payment and other hospital operations.  
 
• Payment operations  include hospital activities to obtain payment or be reimbursed for 
the provision of health care to an individual. 
• Health care operations  are administrative, financial, legal, and quality improvement 
activities of a hospital that are necessary to conduct business and to support the core 
functions of treatment and payment. These activities include, but are not limited to:  quality assessment and improvement activities, case management and care 
coordination; competency assurance activities, conducting or arranging for medical reviews, audits, or legal services, including fraud and abuse detection and compliance programs; business planning,  development, management, and administration and certain hospital -specific fundraising activities.  
The hospital must develop policies and procedures that reasonably limit disclosures of information contained in the patient’s medical record to the minimum disclosure necessary, except when the disclosure is for treatment or payment purposes, or as otherwi se required 
by State or Federal law.  
When the minimum necessary standard is applied, a hospital may not disclose the entire medical record for a particular purpose, unless it can specifically justify that the whole record is the disclosure amount reasonably required for the purpose.  
 
A hospital may disclose information from the medical record electronically, and may also share an electronic medical record system with other health care facilities, physicians and practitioners, so long as the system is designed and operated with safeguar ds that ensure 
that only authorized disclosures are made.  
 The hospital must obtain written authorization from the patient or the patient’s representative for any other disclosure of medical record information.  
 Preventing Unauthorized Access  
 The hospital must ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot gain access to patient records.  This applies to records in electronic as well as hard copy formats.  Patient records must be secure at all times and in all locations.  This includes open patien t records for 
patients who are currently inpatients in the hospital and outpatients in outpatient clinics.  For hard copy records, techniques such as locked cabinets or file rooms and limiting access to keys or pass codes may be employed.  For electronic r ecords technical safeguards, such 
as business rules that limit access based on need to know, passwords, or other control mechanisms must be in place.  When disposing of copies of medical records, physical safeguards might include first shredding documents containing confidential information, taking appropriate steps to erase information from media used to store electronic records, etc.  
 Release of Original Records  
 The hospital must not release the original of a medical record that exists in a hard copy, paper version only, unless it is required to do so in response to a court order, a subpoena, or Federal or State laws.  For electronic records, the hospital must ens ure that the media or 
other mechanism by which the records are stored electronically is not removed in such a way that all or part of the record is deleted from the hospital’s medical record system.  The 
hospital must have policies and procedures that address how it assures that retains its 
“original” medical records, unless their release is mandated by law/court order/subpoena.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.24(b)(3)  
 
• Verify that policies are in place that limit access to, and disclosure of, medical records to permitted users and uses, and that require written authorization for other disclosures.  Are the policies consistent with the regulatory requirements?   
 
• Observe whether patient records are secured from unauthorized access at all times 
and in all locations. 
 
• Ask the hospital to demonstrate what precautions are taken to prevent physical or electronic altering of content previously entered into a patient record, or to prevent unauthorized disposal of patient records. 
 
• Verify that patient medical record information is released only as permitted under 
the hospital’s policies and procedures.  
 
• Conduct observations and interview staff to determine what safeguards are in place 
or precautions are taken to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining physical access or electronic access to information in patient records.  
 
• If the hospital uses electronic patient records, is access to patient records controlled through standard measures, such as business rules defining permitted access, passwords, etc.?  
 
• Do the hospital’s policies and procedures provide that “original” medical records are retained, unless their release is mandated under Federal or State law, court order or subpoena?   Interview staff responsible for medical records to determine if they are  
aware of the limitations on release of “original” medical records.

§482.24(c) Standard:  Content of Record  
 The medical record must contain information to justify admission and continued hospitalization, support the diagnosis, and describe the patient’s progress and response to medications and services.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.24(c)  
 The medical record must contain information such as notes, documentation, records, reports, recordings, test results, assessments etc. to:  
 
• Justify admission;  
 
• Justify continued hospitalization;  
 • Support the diagnosis;  
 
• Describe the patient’s progress;  
 • Describe the patient’s response to medications; and  
 
• Describe the patient’s response to services such as interventions, care, treatments, 
etc. 
 The medical record must contain complete information/documentation regarding evaluations, interventions, care provided, services, care plans, discharge plans, and the patient’s response to those activities.  
 Patient medical record information, such as, laboratory reports, test results, consults, assessments, radiology reports, dictated notes, etc. must be promptly filed in the patient’s medical record in order to be available to the physician and other care pr oviders to use in 
making assessments of the patient’s condition, to justify continued hospitalization, to support the diagnosis, to describe the patient’s progress, and to describe the patient’s response to medications, interventions, and services, in planning the patient’s care, and in making decisions on the provision of care to the patient.   
A-0450 
(Rev. 47, Issued: 06- 05-09, Effective/Implementation: 06- 05-09) 
§482.24(c) (1) - All patient medical record entries must be legible, complete, dated, 
timed, and authenticated in written or electronic form by the person responsible for providing or evaluating the service provided, consistent with hospital policies and procedures.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.24(c)(1)  
 All entries in the medical record must be legible .  Orders, progress notes, nursing notes, or 
other entries in the medical record that are not legible may be misread or misinterpreted and may lead to medical errors or other adverse patient events.  
 All entries in the medical record must be  complete.  A medical record is considered 
complete if it contains sufficient information to identify the patient; support the diagnosis/condition; justify the care, treatment, and services; document the course and results of care, treatment, and services; and prom ote continuity of care among providers.  
With these criteria in mind, an individual entry into the medical record must contain sufficient information on the matter that is the subject of the entry to permit the medical record to satisfy the completeness standard.  
 All entries in the medical record must be dated,  timed, and authenticated, in written or 
electronic form, by the person responsible for providing or evaluating the service provided.  
 
• The time and date of each entry (orders, reports, notes, etc.) must be accurately documented.  Timing establishes when an order was given, when an activity happened or when an activity is to take place.  Timing and dating entries is necessary for patient s afety and quality of care.  Timing and dating of entries 
establishes a baseline for future actions or assessments and establishes a timeline of events.  Many patient interventions or assessments are based on time intervals or timelines of various signs, symptoms, or events. (71 FR 68687)  
 
• The hospital must have a method to establish the identity of the author of each entry.  This would include verification of the author of faxed orders/entries or computer entries.  
 
• The hospital must have a method to require that each author takes a specific action to verify that the entry being authenticated is his/her entry or that he/she is responsible for the entry, and that the entry is accurate.  
 
The requirements for dating and timing do not apply to orders or prescriptions that are 
generated outside of the hospital until they are presented to the hospital at the time of service.  Once the hospital begins processing such an order or prescription, it is responsible for ensuring that the implementation of the order or prescription by the hospital is promptly dated, and timed in the patient’s medical record.  
 When a practitioner is using a preprinted order set, the ordering practitioner may be in compliance with the requirement at § 482.24(c)(1) to date, time, and authenticate an order if 
the practitioner accomplishes the following: 
 
• Last page:   Sign, date, and time the last page of the orders, with the last page also 
identifying the total number of pages in the order set. 
 
• Pages with Internal Selections:   Sign or initial any other (internal) pages of the 
order set where selections or changes have been made.  
 
o The practitioner should initial/sign the top or bottom of the pertinent page(s);and  
 
o The practitioner should also initial each place in the preprinted order set where changes, such as additions, deletions, or strike-outs of components that do not apply, have been made. 
 
• It is not necessary to initial every preprinted box that is checked to indicate selection of an order option, so long as there are no changes made to the option(s) selected. 
 
In the case of a pre-established electronic order set, the same principles would apply, so that the practitioner would date, time and authenticate the final order that resulted from the electronic selection/annotation process, with the exception that pages with internal changes would not need to be initialed or signed if they are part of an integrated single electronic document.  Authentication of medical record entries may include written signatures, initials, computer key, or other code.  For authentication, in written or electronic form, a method must be established to identify the author.  When rubber stamps or electronic authorizations are used for authentication, the hospital must have policies and procedures to ensure that such stamps or authorizations are used only by the individuals whose signature they represent.  There shall be no delegation of stamps or authentication codes to another individual.  It should be noted that some insurers and other payers may have a policy prohibiting the use of rubber stamps as a means of authenticating the medical records that support a claim for payment.  Medicare payment policy, for example, no longer permits such use of rubber stamps.  Thus, while the use of a rubber stamp for signature authentication is not prohibited under the CoPs and analysis of the rubber stamp method per se is not an element of the survey process, hospitals may wish to eliminate their usage in order to avoid denial of claims for payment.  
 Where an electronic medical record is in use, the hospital must demonstrate how it prevents alterations of record entries after they have been authenticated.  Information needed to review an electronic medical record, including pertinent codes and security  features, must 
be readily available to surveyors to permit their review of sampled medical records while on-site in the hospital.  
 When State law and/or hospital policy requires that entries in the medical record made by residents or non-physicians be countersigned by supervisory or attending medical staff members, then the medical staff rules and regulations must address counter-signature 
requirements and processes.  
 
A system of auto- authentication in which a physician or other practitioner authenticates an 
entry that he or she cannot review, e.g., because it has not yet been transcribed, or the electronic entry cannot be displayed, is not consistent with these require ments. There must 
be a method of determining that the practitioner did, in fact, authenticate the entry after it was created.  In addition, failure to disapprove an entry within a specific time period is not acceptable as authentication.  
 The practitioner must separately date and time his/her signature authenticating an entry, even though there may already be a date and time on the document, since the latter may not reflect when the entry was authenticated.  For certain electronically -gener ated documents, 
where the date and time that the physician reviewed the electronic transcription is automatically printed on the document, the requirements of this section would be satisfied.  However, if the electronically -generated document only prints t he date and time that an 
event occurred (e.g., EKG printouts, lab results, etc.) and does not print the date and time that the practitioner actually reviewed the document, then the practitioner must either authenticate, date, and time this document itself or incorporate an acknowledgment that the document was reviewed into another document (such as the H&P, a progress note, etc.), which would then be authenticated, dated, and timed by the practitioner.  
 Survey Procedures §482.24(c)(1)  
 Review a sample of open and closed medical records.  
 
• Determine whether all medical record entries are legible.  Are they clearly written in such a way that they are not likely to be misread or misinterpreted?  
 
• Determine whether orders, progress notes, nursing notes, or other entries in the medical record are complete.  Does the medical record contain sufficient information to identify the patient; support the diagnosis/condition; justify the care, treatment, and  services; document the course and results of care, treatment, and 
services; and promote continuity of care among providers?  
 
• Determine whether medical record entries are dated, timed, and appropriately authenticated by the person who is responsible for ordering, providing, or evaluating the service provided.  
 
• Determine whether all orders, including verbal orders, are written in the medical record and signed by the practitioner who is caring for the patient and who is authorized by hospital policy and in accordance with State law to write orders. 
 
• Determine whether the hospital has a means for verifying signatures, both written and electronic, written initials, codes, and stamps when such are used for authorship identification.  For electronic medical records, ask the hospital to demonstrate the security features that maintain the integrity of entries and verification of electronic signatures and authorizations.  Examine the hospital’s policies and procedures for using the system, and determine if documents are being authenticated after they are created.

§482.24(c) (2) - All orders, including verbal orders, must be dated, timed, and 
authenticated promptly by the ordering practitioner or by another practitioner who is 
responsible for the care of the patient only if such a practitioner is acting in 
accordance with State law, including scope -of-practice laws, hospital policies, and 
medical staff bylaws, rules, and regulations.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.24(c)(2)  
 The hospital must ensure that all orders, including verbal orders, are dated, timed, and authenticated promptly.  The Merriam -Webster online dictionary defines “prompt” as 
performed readily or immediately.  
 Verbal orders are orders for medications, treatments, interventions or other patient care that are transmitted as oral, spoken communications between senders and receivers, delivered either face- to-face or via telephone.  
 The receiver of a verbal order must date, time, and sign the verbal order in accordance with hospital policy.  CMS expects hospital policies and procedures for verbal orders to include a read -back and verification process.   
 The prescribing practitioner must verify, sign, date and time the order as soon as possible after issuing the order, in accordance with hospital policy, and State and Federal requirements.  
 Authentication of a verbal order may be written, electronic, or faxed.  The hospital must have a method for establishing the identity of the practitioner who has given a verbal order, including verification of the author of faxed verbal orders or computer entries.  
 In some instances, the ordering practitioner may not be able to authenticate his or her order, including a verbal order (e.g., the ordering practitioner gives a verbal order which is written 
and transcribed, and then is “off duty” for the weekend or an ext ended period of time).  In 
such cases it is acceptable for another practitioner who is responsible for the patient’s care to authenticate the order, including a verbal order, of the ordering practitioner as long as it is permitted under State law, hospital policies and medical staff bylaws, rules, and regulations.   Hospitals may choose in their policies to restrict which practitioners it would authorize to authenticate another practitioner’s orders.  For example, a hospital could choose to restrict authent ication of orders for pediatric patients to practitioners who are 
privileged to provide pediatric care.  (77 FR 29053, May 16, 2012)  
 
• All practitioners responsible for the patient’s care are expected to have knowledge of 
the patient’s hospital course, medical plan of care, condition, and current status. 
 
• When a practitioner other than the ordering practitioner authenticates an order, that 
practitioner assumes responsibility for the order as being complete, accurate and final.  
 
• A qualified non- physician practitioner, such as a physician assistant (PA) or nurse 
practitioner (NP), who is responsible for the care of the patient may authenticate a  
physician’s or other qualified non- physician practitioner’s order only if the order is  
within his/her scope of practice.  
 If State law requires that the ordering practitioner authenticate his/her own orders, or his/her own verbal orders, then a practitioner other than the prescribing practitioner would not be permitted to authenticate the verbal order in that State.  
(71 FR 68682 and 77 FR 29053, May 16, 2012)  
 NOTE CONCERNING VERBAL ORDERS FOR LABORATORY TESTS:  
 The requirement to authenticate promptly a verbal order applies to verbal orders associated with both inpatients and outpatients.  It is possible that a hospital verbal order for a laboratory test could be authenticated in compliance with the Clinical Labo ratory 
Improvement Amendment (CLIA) regulatory standard of authentication, i.e., within 30 
days, but nonetheless be out of compliance with the hospital Medical Records Services 
requirement for prompt authentication of all orders, including verbal orders.  Because  CLIA 
laboratories – even if physically situated in a hospital – are surveyed for compliance only with CLIA regulations, the laboratory would not be cited for a deficiency by a CLIA survey team.  However, hospital surveyors conducting a survey would cite t he hospital’s inpatient 
or outpatient recordkeeping for deficiencies under the Medical Record Services CoP if the lab order originated for a patient during a hospital inpatient stay or hospital outpatient clinic visit and the order was not authenticated pr omptly. 
 Survey Procedures §482.24(c)(2)  
 
Does the hospital have policies and procedures requiring prompt authentication of all orders, including verbal orders, by the ordering practitioner or, if permitted under State law, hospital policy and medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations, another practitioner responsible for the care of the patient?  
 
• Do the hospital's policies and procedures for verbal orders include a "read back and verify" process where the receiver of the order reads back the order to the ordering practitioner to verify its accuracy?  
 
Review orders, including verbal orders, in a sample of medical records.  Have orders been dated, timed, and authenticated promptly by the ordering practitioner or, if permitted under State law, hospital policy and medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations, another practitioner who is responsible for the care of the patient?  
 
• Has the receiver of a verbal order dated, timed, and signed the order according to 
hospital policy?

(Rev. 95, Issued: 12- 12-13, Effective: 06 -07-13, Implementation: 06- 07-13) 
 §482.24(c)  (3) Hospitals may use pre -printed and electronic standing orders, order 
sets, and protocols for patient orders only if the hospital:  
 
(i) Establishes that such orders and protocols have been reviewed and approved by the 
medical staff and the hospital’s nursing and pharmacy leadership;  
 
(ii) Demonstrates that such orders and protocols are consistent with nationally 
recognized and evidence -based guidelines;  
 (iii) Ensures that the periodic and regular review of such orders and protocols is 
conducted by the medical staff and the hospital’s nursing and pharmacy leadership to determine the continuing usefulness and safety of the orders and protocols; and 
 (iv) Ensures that such orders and protocols are dated, timed, and authenticated promptly 
in the patient’s medical record by the ordering practitioner or another practitioner responsible for the care of the patient only if such a practitioner is acting in a ccordance with 
State law, including scope -of-practice laws, hospital policies, and medical staff bylaws, 
rules, and regulations.  Interpretive Guidelines §482.24(c)(3)  
 What is covered by this regulation?  
There is no standard definition of a “standing order” in the hospital community at large (77 
FR 29055, May 16, 2012), but the terms “pre -printed standing orders,” “electronic standing 
orders,” “order sets,” and “protocols for patient orders” are various ways in which the term 
“standing orders” has been applied.  For purposes of brevity, in our guidance we generally use the term “standing order(s)” to refer interchangeably to pre -printed and electronic 
standing or ders, order sets, and protocols.  However, we note that the lack of a standard 
definition for these terms and their interchangeable and indistinct use by hospitals and health care professionals may result in confusion regarding what is or is not subject to the requirements of §482.24(c)(3), particularly with respect to “order sets.”  
 
• Not all pre -printed and electronic order sets are considered a type of “standing order” 
covered by this regulation.  Where the order sets consist solely of menus of treatment or 
care options designed to facilitate the creation of a patient -specific set of orders by a 
physician or other qualified practitioner authorized to write orders, and none of the treatment choices and actions can be initiated by non- practitioner clinical staff before 
the physician or other qualified  practitioner actually creates the patient- specific 
order(s), such menus would not be considered “standing orders” covered by this regulation.  We note in such cases the menus provide a convenient and efficient method for the physician/practitioner to create an order, but the availability of such menu options does not create an “order set” that is a “standing order” subject to the requirements of this regulation.  The physician/practitioner may, based on his/her professional judgment, choose to:   use the available menu options to create an order; not use the menu options and instead create an order from scratch; or modify the available menu options to create the order.  In each case the physician/practi tioner 
exercises his privileges to prescribe specific diagnosis and/or treatment activities that are to be implemented for a patient.  
 
• On the other hand, in cases where hospital policy permits treatment to be initiated, by a 
nurse, for example, without a prior specific order from the treating physician/practitioner, this policy and practice must meet the requirements of this regulation for review of standing orders, regardless of whether it is called a standing order, a protocol, an order set, or something else.  Such treatment is typically initiated when a patient’s condition meets certain pre -defined clinical criteria.  For example, 
standing orders may be initiated as part of an emergency response or as part of an 
evidence -based treatment regimen where it is not practical for a nurse to obtain either a 
written, authenticated order or a verbal order from a physician or other qualified practitioner prior to the provision of care.  
 
• Hybrids, where a component for non- practitioner -initiated treatment is embedded within 
a menu of options for the physician or other qualified practitioner, still require compliance with the requirements for a standing order for that component.  For example, if an order set includes a protocol for nurse -initiated potassium replacement, 
that protocol must be reviewed under the requirements of this regulation before it may become part of a menu of treatment options from which a physician or other qualified practitioner would select treatments for a particular patient
. 
 Requirements for “Standing Orders”  
 Hospitals have the flexibility to use standing orders to expedite the delivery of patient care in well- defined clinical scenarios for which there is evidence supporting the application of 
standardized treatments or interventions.    Appropriate use of standing orders can contribute to patient safety and quality of care by promoting consistency of care, based on objective evidence, when orders  
may be initiated as part of an emergency response or as part of an evidence- based treatment 
regimen where it is not practicable for a nurse or other non- practitioner to obtain a verbal or 
authenticated written order  from a physician or other practitioner responsible for the care of the patient prior to the provision of care.  
 
In all cases, implementation of a standing order must be medically appropriate for the 
patient to whom the order is applied.    Much of the evidence on the effectiveness of standing orders in hospitals has been narrowly focused on aspects of their use by Rapid Response Teams addressing inpatient emergencies.  However, standing orders may also be appropriate in other clinical circum stances, 
including, but not limited to:  
 
• Protocols for triaging and initiating required screening examinations and stabilizing 
treatment for emergency department patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute asthma, myocardial infarction, stroke, etc.  (This does not relieve a hospital of  its 
obligations under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) to have qualified medical personnel complete required screening and, when applicable, stabilizing treatment in a timely manner.)  
 
• Post-operative recovery areas.  
 
• Timely provision of immunizations, such as certain immunizations for newborns, for which there are clearly established and nationally recognized guidelines. 
 Standing orders may not be used in clinical situations where they are specifically prohibited under Federal or State law.  For example, the hospital patient’s rights regulation at §482.13(e)(6)  specifically prohibits the use of standing orders for restrai nt or seclusion of hospital patients.  
 When deciding whether to use standing orders, hospitals should also be aware that, although use of standing orders is permitted under the hospital Conditions of Participation, some insurers, including Medicare, may not pay for the services provided because  of the 
use of standing orders.  (77 FR 29056)   
 Minimum requirements for standing orders.  Hospitals may employ standing orders only if the following requirements are met for each standing order for a particular well -defined 
clinical scenario:  
 
• Each standing order must be reviewed and approved by the hospital’s medical staff and 
nursing and pharmacy leadership before it may be used in the clinical setting.   The regulation requires a multi -disciplinary collaborative effort in establishing the protocols 
associated with each standing order.  
 
• The hospital’s policies and procedures for standing orders must address the process 
by which a standing order is developed; approved; monitored; initiated by authorized staff; and subsequently authenticated by physicians or other practitioners 
responsible for the care of  the patient.  
 
• For each approved standing order, there must be specific criteria clearly identified in the protocol for the order for a nurse or other authorized personnel to initiate the execution of a particular standing order, for example, the specific clinical situat ions, 
patient conditions, or diagnoses by which initiation of the order would be justified.  Under no circumstances may a hospital use standing orders in a manner that requires any staff not authorized to write patient orders to make clinical decisions out side of 
their scope of practice in order to initiate such orders.  
 Since residents are physicians, this regulation does not require specific criteria for a resident to initiate the execution of a particular standing order.  However, there may be State laws governing the practice of residents in hospitals that are more restrictive; if so, the hospital is expected to comply with the State law.  Likewise, 
the hospital may choose through its policies and medical staff bylaws, rules and 
regulations to restrict the role of residents with respect to standing orders.  
 
• Policies and procedures should also address the instructions that the medical, 
nursing, and other applicable professional staff receive on the conditions and criteria for using standing orders as well as any individual staff responsibilities associated with the initiation and execution of standing orders.  An order that has been initiated 
for a specific patient must be added to the patient’s medical record at the time of initiation, or as soon as possible thereafter.  
 
• Likewise, standing order policies and procedures must specify the process whereby 
the physician or other practitioner responsible for the care of the patient acknowledges and authenticates the initiation of all standing orders after the fact, with the exception of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, which do not require such authentication in accordance with § 482.23(c)(2).  
 (76 FR 65896, October 24, 2011 & 77 FR 29056, May 16, 2012)  
 
• The hospital must be able to document that the standing order is consistent with nationally recognized and evidence -based guidelines.  This does not mean that there 
must be a template standing order available in national guidelines which the hospital copies, but rather that the content of each standing  order in the hospital must be 
consistent with nationally recognized, evidence -based guidelines for providing care.  
The burden of proof is on the hospital to show that there is a sound basis for the standing order.  
 
• Each standing order must be subject to periodic and regular review by the medical staff 
and the hospital’s nursing and pharmacy leadership, to determine the continuing 
usefulness and safety of the orders and protocols.  At a minimum, an annual review of each standing order would satisfy this requirement.  However, the hospital’s policies and procedures must also address a process for the identification and timely completion of any requisite updates, corrections, modifications, or  revisions based on changes in 
nationally recognized, evidence -based guidelines.  The review may be prepared by the 
hospital’s QAPI program, so long as the medical staff and nursing and pharmacy leadership read, review, and, as applicable, act upon the final report.  Among other things, reviews are expected to consider:  
 
• Whether the standing order’s protocol continues to be consistent with the latest standards of practice reflected in nationally recognized, evidence- based guidelines;  
 
• Whether there have been any preventable adverse patient events resulting from the use of the standing order, and if so, whether changes in the order would reduce the likelihood of future similar adverse events.  Note that the review would not be expected t o address adverse events that are a likely outcome of the course of  
patient’s disease or injury, even if the order was applied to that patient, unless there is concern that use of the standing order exacerbated the patient’s condition; and 
 
• Whether a standing order has been initiated and executed in a manner consistent with the order’s protocol, and if not, whether the protocol needs revision and/or staff need more training in the correct procedures.  
 
• An order that has been initiated for a specific patient must be added to the patient’s 
medical record at the time of initiation, or as soon as possible thereafter.
  The hospital 
must ensure each standing order that has been executed is dated, timed, and 
authenticated promptly in the patient’s medical record by the ordering practitioner or 
another practitioner responsible for the care of the patient.  Another practitioner who is 
responsible for the care of the patient may date, time and authenticate the stan ding order 
instead of the ordering practitioner, but only if the other practitioner is acting in 
accordance with State law, including scope of practice laws, hospital policies, and 
medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations. 
 
The hospital’s standing orders policies and procedures must specify the process whereby the responsible practitioner, or another authorized practitioner, acknowledges and authenticates the initiation of each standing order after the fact, with the exceptio n 
of standing orders for influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, which do not require such authentication.  Further, t he responsible practitioner must be able to modify, cancel, 
void or decline to authenticate orders that were not medically necessary in a par ticular 
situation.  The medical record must reflect the physician’s actions to modify, cancel, void or refusal to authenticate a standing order that the physician determined was not medically necessary.  (76 FR 65896, October 24, 2011)   
 Survey Procedures §482.24(c)(3)  
 
• Ask the hospital’s medical staff and its nursing and pharmacy leadership whether standing orders are used.  If yes, ask them to describe how a standing order is developed and monitored, and their role in the process.  
 
• Ask to see an example of one or more standing orders, including documentation on the development of the order, including:  
 
• Reference to the evidence- based national guidelines that support it;  
  
• Participation of medical staff and nursing and pharmacy leadership in the review and approval of the standing order;  
 
• Description of the protocol to be followed when initiating the execution of 
the order, including description of the roles and responsibilities of various 
types of staff;  
 
• Description of the process for authenticating the order’s initiation by the 
practitioner responsible for the care of the patient, or another authorized 
practitioner;  
 
• Evidence of training of personnel on the order’s protocol; and  
• Evidence of periodic evaluation and, if needed, modification of the standing order, including whether the order remains consistent with current evidence -
based national guidelines, staff adherence to the protocol for initiation and execution, and whether there have been any preventable adverse events associated with the order.  
 
• Ask staff providing clinical services in areas of the hospital where standing orders might be typically used, including but not limited to, the emergency department, labor and delivery units, and inpatient units, whether standing orders are used.  If they say yes, ask them:  
 
o To describe a typical scenario where a standing order would be used, and what they would do in that case.  
 
o For a copy of the protocol for that standing order.  Does their description conform to the protocol?  
 
• Review a sample of medical records of patients where a nurse- initiated standing 
order was used and verify that the order was documented and authenticated by a 
practitioner responsible for the care of the patient.

§482.24(c)(4)(v) - Properly executed informed consent forms for procedures and 
treatments specified by the medical staff, or by Federal or State law if applicable, to require written patient consent.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.24(c)(4)(v)  
 Informed consent is discussed in three locations in the CMS Hospital CoPs.  See also the guidelines for 42 CFR 482.13(b)(2) pertaining to patients' rights, and the guidelines for 42 CFR 482.51(b)(2), pertaining to surgical services.  
 The medical record must contain a document recording the patient’s informed consent for those procedures and treatments that have been specified as requiring informed consent.  Medical staff policies should address which procedures and treatments require w ritten 
informed consent.  There may also be applicable Federal or State law requiring informed consent.  The informed consent form contained in the medical record should provide evidence that it was properly executed.  
 Informed Consent Forms  
 A properly executed informed consent form should reflect the patient consent process.  Except as specified for emergency situations in the hospital’s informed consent policies, all inpatient and outpatient medical records must contain a properly executed i nformed consent 
form prior to conducting any procedure or other type of treatment that requires informed consent.  An informed consent form, in order to be properly executed, must be consistent with hospital policies as well as applicable State and Federal law or regulation.  A properly 
executed informed consent form contains the following minimum elements:  
 
• Name of the hospital where the procedure or other type of medical treatment is to take place;  
 
• Name of the specific procedure, or other type of medical treatment for which 
consent is being given;  
 
• Name of the responsible practitioner who is performing the procedure or administering the medical treatment; 
 
• Statement that the procedure or treatment, including the anticipated benefits, material risks, and alternative therapies, was explained to the patient or the patient’s legal representative; (Material risks could include risks with a high degree of likeliho od but a low degree of severity, as well as those with a very low degree of 
likelihood but high degree of severity.  Hospitals are free to delegate to the responsible practitioner, who uses the available clinical evidence as informed by the practitioner’s professional judgment, the determination of which material risks, benefits and alternatives will be discussed with the patient.)  
 
• Signature of the patient or the patient’s legal representative; and  
 • Date and time the informed consent form is signed by the patient or the patient’s 
legal representative.  
 
If there is applicable State law governing the content of the informed consent form, then the hospital’s form must comply with those requirements.  A well -designed informed consent form might also include the following additional 
information:  
 
• Name of the practitioner who conducted the informed consent discussion with the patient or the patient’s representative.  
 
• Date, time, and signature of the person witnessing the patient or the patient’s legal 
representative signing the consent form.  
 
• Indication or listing of the material risks of the procedure or treatment that were discussed with the patient or the patient’s representative; 
 
• Statement, if applicable, that physicians other than the operating practitioner, 
including but not limited to residents, will be performing important tasks related to 
the surgery, in accordance with the hospital’s policies and, in the case of residents, 
based on their skill set and under the supervision of the responsible practitioner.   
 
• Statement, if applicable, that qualified medical practitioners who are not physicians who will perform important parts of the surgery or administration of anesthesia will be performing only tasks that are within their scope of practice, as determined under  
State law and regulation, and for which they have been granted privileges by the hospital. 
 Survey Procedures §482.24(c)(4)(v)  
 
• Verify that the hospital has assured that the medical staff has specified which procedures and treatments require written patient consent.  
• Verify that the hospital’s standard informed consent form contains the elements 
listed above as the minimum elements of a properly executed informed consent. 
 
• Compare the hospital’s standard informed consent form to the hospital’s policies on 
informed consent, to verify that the form is consistent with the policies.  If there is 
applicable State law, verify that the form is consistent with the requirements of that 
law. 
 
• Review a minimum of six random medical records of patients who have, are 
undergoing, or are about to under a procedure or treatment that requires informed consent.  Verify that each medical record contains informed consent forms.

§482.24(c)(4)(vii) - Discharge summary with outcome of hospitalization, disposition of case, and provisions for follow- up care.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.24(c)(4)(vii)  All patient medical records must contain a discharge summary.  A discharge summary discusses the outcome of the hospitalization, the disposition of the patient, and provisions for follow -up care. Follow-up care provisions include any post hospital appointments, how 
post hospital patient care needs are to be met, and any plans for post-hospital care by providers such as home health, hospice, nursing homes, or assisted living.  The MD/DO or other qualified practitioner with admitting privileges in accordance with State law and hospital policy, who admitted the patient is responsible for the patient during the patient’s stay in the hospital.  This responsibility would include developing and entering the discharge summary.  Other MD/DOs who work with the patient’s MD/DO and who are covering for the patient’s MD/DO and who are knowledgeable about the patient’s condition, the patient’s care during the hospitalization, and the patient’s discharge plans may write the discharge summary at the responsible MD/DO’s request.  In accordance with hospital policy, and 42 CFR Part 482.12(c)(1)(i)
 the MD/DO may 
delegate writing the discharge summary to other qualified health care personnel such as nurse practitioners and MD/DO assistants to the extent recognized under State law or a State’s regulatory mechanism.  
 Whether delegated or non -delegated, we would expect the person who writes the discharge 
summary to authenticate, date, and time their entry and additionally for delegated discharge summaries we would expect the MD/DO responsible for the patient during his/her hospital stay to co -authenticate and date the discharge summary to verify its content. 
 The discharge summary requirement would include outpatient records.  For example:  
• The outcome of the treatment, procedures, or surgery; 
 
• The disposition of the case; 
 • Provisions for follow-up care for an outpatient surgery patient or an emergency 
department patient who was not admitted or transferred to another hospital.

§482.25 Condition of Participation:  Pharmaceutical Services.  
 The hospital must have pharmaceutical services that meet the needs of the patients….    Interpretive Guidelines §482.25   What is included in pharmaceutical services?  
 Pharmaceutical services encompass the functions of procuring, storing, compounding, re -
packaging, and dispensing all medications, biologicals, chemicals and medication- related 
devices within the hospital.  They also include providing medication -related information to 
care professionals within the hospital, as well as direct provision of medication -related care.  
 
Meeting patient needs  
 Hospitals must provide pharmaceutical services that meet the needs of their patients.
  The 
scope and complexity of pharmaceutical services available in the hospital must be consistent 
with the volume and types of patients the hospital serves. Except in unusual circumstances, 
the pharmaceutical service is expected to make available in a timely manner the volume and types of medications typically needed.  These would be those medications typic ally 
prescribed by the hospital’s practitioners for hospital patients receiving inpatient services, surgical services, diagnostic services involving medications as a component of testing, and outpatient drug therapies administered while the patient is in the hospital.  
 Not every hospital is expected to offer the same level of pharmaceutical services.  For example:  
 
• It would not be uncommon for a psychiatric hospital to maintain a relatively limited pharmaceutical service, due to minimal need for compounding, and/or dispensing multiple types and forms of medications and biologicals.   
 
• On the other hand, a short -term acute care hospital with a busy oncology outpatient 
service and other complex medical and surgical departments would be expected to provide a wider range of pharmaceutical services that are ready to be furnished when needed.    
 Survey Procedures §482.25   
• Ask the hospital for evidence of the scope and complexity of its pharmaceutical services.  
 
• Ask how the hospital has determined that the services meet the needs of its patients. 
 
• Ask unit nursing staff if prescribed medications are routinely available and timely.  If there are reports of frequent delays or other problems, probe further with the director of pharmaceutical services.

 …..The medical staff is responsible for developing policies and procedures that minimize drug errors.  This function may be delegated to the hospital’s organized pharmaceutical service.]  
 §482.25(a) Standard:  Pharmacy Management and Administration  
 The pharmacy or drug storage area must be administered in accordance with accepted professional principles.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.25(a)  
 Pharmaceutical services must be administered in accordance with accepted professional principles.  Accepted professional principles includes compliance with applicable Federal and State laws, regulations, and guidelines governing pharmaceutical services, a s well as, 
standards or recommendations promoted by nationally recognized professional 
organizations, such as those found in the U.S. Pharmacopeia/National Formulary 
(USP/NF).  
 The hospital’s pharmacy service must ensure safe and appropriate procurement, storage, preparation, dispensing, use, tracking and control, and disposal of medications and medication -related devices throughout the hospital, for both inpatient and outpatient  
services.  
 Hospitals may choose how to set up the pharmaceutical services utilizing various methods including, but not limited to:  
• a unit dose system (i.e.; single unit package, dispensed in most ready to administer form possible),  
• individual prescription (i.e.; instruction for a single patient, written by a medical practitioner for a medication or treatment),  
• floor stock system (i.e.; storage of pharmaceutical and over -the-counter drugs on the 
patient care unit), or  
• a combination of these systems, as long as they are properly stored.  
 However, hospitals with only a drug storage area must only use drugs that are pre -packaged 
and need no further preparation beyond that required at the point of care.  
 The hospital must develop, implement and periodically review and revise as needed policies and procedures governing provision of pharmaceutical services. The regulation makes the hospital’s medical staff responsible for the policies and procedures, but als o permits the 
medical staff to delegate this function to the hospital’s pharmaceutical services.  The 
policies and procedures must reflect accepted professional pharmacy principles, and the pharmacy director must be able to identify the source(s) used when developing and adopting the policies and procedures.  There must also be a process to train staff on the applicable policies and procedures and to monitor their adherence.  
 Policies and Procedures for Minimizing Drug Errors  
 Medication errors are a substantial source of morbidity and mortality risk in the hospitalized setting.  Therefore, hospitals must take steps to prevent, identify, and minimize these errors.  These steps must be based on accepted professional principles.   This includes not only ensuring that the pharmacy processes conform to of accepted standards of pharmacy practice b ut also proactively identifying and reviewing Adverse Drug Events (ADE) that 
occur.  Pharmacies also need to be aware of external alerts to real or potential pharmacy -
related problems in hospitals.   The pharmaceutical services policies and procedures must be designed to minimize drug errors and are expected to address:  
 
• High -alert medications -  are considered inherently high risk for adverse drug events.  
High alert drugs may include controlled medications, medications not on the approved 
FDA list, medications with a narrow therapeutic range, psychotherapeutic medications, look- alike/sound- alike medications and those new to the market or new to the hospital .  
Although mistakes may or may not be more common with these drugs, the consequences of errors are often harmful, sometimes fatal, to patients. Examples of ways to minimize high alert medication errors include, but are not limited to, the following: dosing limits, administration guidelines, packaging, labeling and storage.  
 
• Investigational medications -  hospitals that conduct research involving investigational 
medications must have a policy and procedure in place to ensure that investigational 
medications are safely controlled and administered.  Procedures for the use of 
investigational medications include, but are not limited to, the following:  A written 
process for reviewing, approving, supervising and monitoring investigational medications s pecifying that when pharmacy services are provided, the pharmacy 
controls the storage, dispensing, labeling, and distribution of the investigational medication.  
 
• Adherence to professional standards of practice for all compounding, packaging  dispensing and drug disposal activities;  
 
• Standardizing medication -related devices and equipment where feasible. For example, 
limit the types of general -purpose infusion pumps to one or two;  
 
• Availability  of up- to-date medication information and pharmacy expertise on- call when 
pharmacy does not operate  24 hours a day;  
 
• Standardization  of prescribing and communication practices to include:  
 
o Avoidance of dangerous abbreviations;  
 
o All elements of the order – dose, strength, units (metric), route, frequency, and rate;

o Use of facility  approved pre -printed order sheets whenever possible.  
 
o Prohibition of orders to “resume previous orders;”  
 
• Availability of patient- specific information to all individuals involved in provision of 
pharmaceutical services.  The patient information must be sufficient to properly order, prepare, dispense, administer and monitor medications as appropriate;  
 
• Identification of when weight -based dosing for pediatric populations is required; and  
 • A voluntary, non- punitive, reporting system to monitor and report adverse drug events 
(including medication errors and adverse drug reactions);  
 • Monitoring drug alerts and/or recalls.  The hospital should have a means to incorporate 
external alerts and/or recommendations from national associations and governmental agencies for review and facility policy and procedure revision consideration. National associations could include Institute for Safe Medications Practice and National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention. Governmental agencies may include:  Food and Drug Administration, Med Watch Program; and 
 
• The hospital’s pharmacy services must be integrated into its hospital -wide QAPI 
program and therefore, i t is important to flag new types of mistakes and continually 
improve and refine policies and procedures as a result of analyses of errors and adverse 
events.

[§482.25 Condition of Participation:  Pharmaceutical Services  
 The hospital…. must have a pharmacy directed by a registered pharmacist or a drug storage area under competent supervision….  
 
§482.25(a)(1) - A full -time, part -time, or consulting pharmacist must be responsible 
for developing, supervising, and coordinating all the activities of the pharmacy services.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.25 and §482.25(a)(1)  
 Pharmaceutical services offered throughout the hospital must be under the direction of a pharmacist, who may be full -time, part- time, or consulting.  This is required even in the 
case of a hospital that has a drug storage area instead of a pharmacy.  The director must have documented training or expertise in hospital pharmacy practice and management.  The hospital must have written criteria for the qualifications of the pharmacy director in accordance with the scope of services provided.  
 The extent of pharmaceutical services provided by the hospital determines whether a part -
time director of the services is sufficient.  Depending on the volume and complexity of the hospital’s services, oversight may not require full -time on -site management at the hospital’s 
pharmacy, but may be accomplished through regularly scheduled visits, and/or use of telecommunications in accordance  with Federal and State law and accepted professional 
principles.  If the hospital does not have a full -time pharmacist, it must be able to provide 
evidence of how a part -time or consulting pharmacist is able to perform all functions 
relating to developing, supervising and coordinating all pharmacy services activities.  In general, hospital pharmacies are staffed with registered pharmacists and pharmacy technicians who perform various functions, including, but not limited to, compounding, labeling, and dispensing of various drugs and biologicals. 
 There may be instances of small hospitals that do not have a pharmacy but utilize a drug storage area for dispensing pre -packaged drugs only.  If the hospital has a drug storage area 
in lieu of a pharmacy, the day- to-day operations of pharmaceutical services must be under 
the supervision of an individual who, if not a pharmacist, nevertheless has documented 
competency to oversee compliance with all the pharmaceutical services regulatory 
requirements (e.g., security, a ccess to locked areas, etc.).  The hospital must establish in 
writing the qualifications of the drug storage area supervisor.  
 The job description or the written agreement for the responsibilities of the pharmacist director should be clearly defined and include development, supervision and coordination of all the activities of pharmacy services, including active leadership of  those committees 
responsible for establishing medication- related policies and procedures.  
 Survey Procedures §482.25 and §482.25(a)(1)  
 
• Does the hospital have a pharmacist who has been appointed to direct the pharmaceutical services?   
 
• Are there written criteria for the qualifications of the pharmacist director?  
 
• Is there evidence in the pharmacist’s file that he/she satisfies the criteria?  
 
• If the hospital has a drug storage area in lieu of a pharmacy, is there evidence the 
storage area is under competent supervision?  
 
• Review the pharmaceutical services Director’s file to verify that he or she meets the 
qualifications established by the medical staff and has been granted privileges as a pharmacist.  
 
• If the Director is a part -time employee or consultant, ask him/her how much 
time/week is spent on developing, supervising and coordinating pharmaceutical services.   
 
• Review  the implementation of the pharmacy director’s responsibilities by:  
 
• Reviewing minutes of meetings (if any) with facility staff regarding 
pharmaceutical services;  
 
• Reviewing the job description or the written agreement to see that the 
responsibilities of the pharmacist are clearly defined and include development supervision and coordination of all the activities of pharmacy services;  
 
• Determining whether the pharmacy director/manager routinely evaluates the performance and competency of pharmacy personnel?  
 
• Ask the pharmacy director to describe how policies and procedures related to pharmaceutical services are developed, approved, and implemented. What is his/her role in this process?  
 
• Is there any evidence of problems within the pharmaceutical services that suggest lack of supervision?

§482.25(a)(3) - Current and accurate records must be kept of the receipt and 
disposition of all scheduled drugs.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.25(a)(3)  
 Components of a record system to maintain current and accurate records of the receipt and disposition of scheduled drugs would include:  
 
• Accountability procedures to ensure control of the distribution, use, and disposition 
of all scheduled drugs.  
 
• Records of the receipt and disposition of all scheduled drugs must be current and 
must be accurate.  
 
• Reco rds trace the movement of scheduled drugs throughout the service.  
 
• The pharmacist is responsible for determining that all drug records are in order and 
that an account  of all scheduled drugs is maintained and reconciled.  
 
• The record system, delineated in policies and procedures,  tracks movement of all 
scheduled drugs from the point of entry into the hospital to the point of departure 
either through administration to the patient, destruction or return to the manufacture.  
This system provides documentation on scheduled drugs in a readily retrievable mann er to facilitate reconciliation of the receipt and disposition of all scheduled 
drugs. 
 
• All drug records are in order and  an account of all scheduled drugs is maintained and any discrepancies in count are reconciled promptly.  
• The hospital system is capable of readily identifying loss or diversion of all controlled substances in such a manner as to minimize the time frame between the actual loss or diversion to the time of detection and determination of the extent of loss or diversion?  
 
• Facility policies and procedures should minimize scheduled drug diversion. 
 Survey Procedures §482.25(a)(3)  
 
• Determine  if there is a record system in place that provides information on 
controlled substances in a readily retrievable manner.  
 
• Review the records to determine that they trace the movement of scheduled drugs throughout  the service.  
 
• Determine  if there is a system, delineated in policies and procedures, that tracks 
movement of all scheduled drugs from the point of entry into the hospital to the 
point of departure either through administration to the patient, destruction or return to the manufac ture.  Determine if this system provides documentation on scheduled 
drugs in a readily retrievable manner to facilitate reconciliation of the receipt and disposition of all scheduled drugs.  
 
• Determine if the pharmacist is responsible for determining that all drug records are in order and that an account of all scheduled drugs is maintained and periodically reconciled.  
 
• Is the hospital system capable of readily identifying loss or diversion of all controlled substances in such a manner as to minimize the time frame between the actual losses or diversion to the time of detection and determination of the extent of loss or diversion?  
 
• Determine if facility policy and procedures minimize scheduled drug diversion.

§482.25(b) Standard:  Delivery of Services  
 In order to provide patient safety, drugs and biologicals must be controlled and distributed in accordance with applicable standards of practice, consistent with Federal and State law.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.25(b)   Drugs and biologicals must be controlled and distributed in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws and regulations, and in accordance with applicable standards of practice.  Applicable standards of practice include compliance with all Federal an d State 
laws, regulations, and guidelines.  The procedures established to prevent unauthorized 
usage and distribution must provide for an accounting of the receipt and disposition of 
drugs subject to the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970.  
 
Other sources of additional guidelines could include, but are not limited to:  American Society of Health -System Pharmacists, American College of Clinical Pharmacy, American 
Pharmacists Association, United States Pharmacopeia,  etc. 
  The hospital must have a process in place for medication orders to be received in the pharmacy and dispensed in a safe and timely manner.  Safe dispensing of medications must be in accordance with accepted standards of practice and includes, but is not lim ited to, the 
following:   
• Implementing systems such as dose limits, pre -printed orders, special labeling, or 
double checks to minimize adverse drug events, especially for high alert medications;  
• Reviewing all medication orders (except in emergency situations) for appropriateness by a pharmacist before the first dose is dispensed.  A process is established for resolving questions with the prescribing practitioner and the discussion and outcome are documented in the patient’s medical record or pharmacy copy of the prescriber’s order;  
 This review should include:  
 
• Therapeutic appropriateness of a patient’s medication regimen;  
 
• Therapeutic duplication in the patient’s medication regimen; 
 • Appropriateness of the drug, dose, frequency, and route of administration;  
 • Real or potential medication -medication, medication -food, medication-
laboratory test and medication- disease interactions;  
 • Real or potential allergies or sensitivities; and  
 
• Other contraindications. 
 
• Medications dispensed by the hospital are retrieved when recalled or discontinued 
by the manufacturer or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for safety reasons;  
 
• Policies and procedures that address the use of medications brought into the hospital by patients or their families when self -administration of medications is permitted by 
hospital policy; and 
 
• Having a system in place to reconcile medications that are not administered (e.g., left in the patient’s medication drawer) when the pharmacy inventories patient medications or restocks patient medications. For example, did the patient refuse the medication, was there a clinical or treatment reason the medication was not used, or was the medication not used due to an error?  
 Monitoring the Effects of Medications  
 
The pharmaceutical service may be responsible for monitoring the effects of medication(s) specified per hospital policy to assure medication therapy is appropriate and minimizes the occurrence of adverse events.  Typically this occurs with anticoagulant therapy and antibiotics prescribed for the pharmacy to establish or adjust the dosage (i.e.; “pharmacy to 
dose” order).  In such cases, the pharmacy’s monitoring process includes:  
 
• Clinical and laboratory data to evaluate the efficacy of medication therapy to 
anticipate or evaluate toxicity and adverse effects;  
 
• Physical signs and clinical symptoms relevant to the patient’s medication therapy;  
 
• Assessing the patient’s own perceptions about side effects, and, when appropriate, perceived efficacy.  
 
(See also the Nursing CoP discussion regarding monitoring of patients at §482.23(c)(4)).  
 Survey Procedures §482.25(b)  
• Are medication orders routinely reviewed by the pharmacy before the first dose?  What evidence can the hospital present that such reviews take place?  
 
• Are questions regarding medication orders resolved with the prescriber and a written 
notation of these discussions documented in the patient’s medical record or 
pharmacy copy of the prescriber’s order?  
 
• Does the hospital pharmacy have a system for monitoring the effects of medication therapies for cases specified per hospital policy?  
 
• Does the hospital retrieve and remove medications available or patient use when the hospital has been informed of a drug recall?

§482.25(b)(1) - All compounding, packaging, and dispensing of drugs 
and biologicals must be under the supervision of a pharmacist and performed consistent with State and Federal laws.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.25(b)(1)  
 
All pharmaceutical services involving compounding, packaging, or dispensing of drugs and biologicals, must be conducted by or under the supervision of a pharmacist and performed consistent with State and Federal laws. The hospital must adopt and implement written policies and procedures to ensure all medic ations are prepared by 
authorized personnel.  
 
Compounded Preparations  
 
Hospitals use many medications that need to be reconstituted, mixed or which otherwise may be considered “compounded” preparations. Some may be compounded in the hospital pharmacy and/or the hospital may obtain some or all from external sources. The extern al sources could include:  
(1) Manufacturers;  
(2) registered outsourcing facilities, and/or compounding pharmacies.  
 
Regardless of the source, if accepted standards for safe compounding are not met, compounded medications may contain less or more than the intended dose and/or may be chemically or microbiologically contaminated, with potentially devastating or even lethal consequences for the patients who receive them.  
 
Use of Registered Outsourcing Facilities  
 
The Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA), signed into law on November 27, 2013, 
contains provisions relating to the oversight of compounding of human drugs. The DQSA 
created a new section 503B in the FDCA under which a compounder may elect to become an “ou tsourcing facility.” The law defines an “outsourcing facility” as a facility 
at one geographic location or address that is engaged in the compounding of sterile drugs; has elected to register as an outsourcing facility; and complies with all of the require ments of section 503B of the FDCA. Facilities that elect to register as outsourcing 
facilities, per section 503B: 
 
• Must comply with the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements, which contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packing of a drug product. The CGMP requirements make su re that a product is safe for use, and that it has 
the ingredients and strength it claims to have. The FDA’s publishes the most current versions of its draft and final regulations and guidance related to compounding on its website: 
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Pharmacy 
Compounding/default.htm ; 
 
• Will be inspected by FDA according to a risk- based schedule;  and 
 
• Must meet certain other conditions, such as reporting adverse events and 
providing FDA with certain information about the products they compound. 
 
In a January 2014 letter to purchasers of compounded medications (available at 
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/PharmacyCompo
unding/ucm380596.htm ), the Commissioner of the FDA encouraged the use of registered 
outsourcing facilities and noted that,“[a]s a purchaser of compounded drugs, you can play 
an important role in improving the quality of compounded drugs by requiring 
compounding pharmacies that supply drugs to your facility to register as outsourcing 
facilities. Once they register, you and the patients you serve can be assured that FDA will 
inspect these facilities on a risk -based schedule, hold them to CGMP requirements, 
monitor the adverse event reports they are required to submit to the agency, and require 
appropriate labeling.” 
 
FDA has posted a list of Registered Human Drug Compounding Outsourcing Facilities, 
including the end date of the last FDA inspection related to compounding, whether investigators observed any significant objectionable conditions, and whether other FDA acti ons were taken based on the last inspection, at: 
http://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/pharmacycompou
n ding/ucm378645.htm  
 
Note that these registered outsourcing facilities are also popularly referred to as “503B pharmacies.”  
 
Use of Compounding Pharmacies 
 
Compounding pharmacies, not registered as an outsourcing facility with the FDA, are popularly referred to as “503A pharmacies” and generally are subject to oversight only by their State pharmacy board. If a hospital obtains compounded medications from a compounding pharmacy rather than a manufacturer or a registered outsourcing facility, 
then the hospital must demonstrate how it assures that the compounded medications it receives under this arrangement have been prepared in accordance with accepted professi onal principles for compounded drugs as well as applicable State or Federal 
laws or regulations. For example, does the contract with the vendor include provisions: 
 
• Ensuring that the hospital has access to quality assurance data verifying that 
the vendor is adhering to current standards of practice for compounding medications and can the hospital document that it obtains and reviews such data?  
 
• Requiring the vendor to meet the requirements of Section 503A of the FDCA 
concerning pharmacy compounding of human drug products? 
  
 
Medications Compounded by the Hospital’s Pharmacy  
 
Only the pharmacy compounds or admixes all sterile medications, intravenous admixtures, 
or other drugs except in emergencies or when not feasible (for example, when there is a need for emergency or immediate patient administration of a compounded sterile preparation). In addition, all compounding of medications used or dispensed by the hospital must be performed consistent with standards of safe practice applicable to both sterile and non- sterile compounding. 
 
Compounded medications, whether non-sterile or sterile, may be subject to physical and chemical contamination and unintended variations in strength. Microbial contamination and bacterial endotoxins are particularly hazardous with respect to compounded medi cations that are intended to be sterile.  
 
Packaging and Labeling of Medications 
 
Safe medication use includes proper packaging and labeling to reduce the risk of error. For individual drug containers: each floor stock drug container is expected to be labeled with the name and strength of the drug, lot and control number equivalent, and expiration date. Appropriate accessory and cautionary statements are included as well as the expiration date and/or, if applicable, a beyond-use date (BUD).  In addition, where applicable, each patient’s individual drug container is expected to be labeled with the patient’s full name and quantity of the drug dispensed. 
 
If the unit dose system is utilized, each single unit dose package is expected to be labeled with the name and strength of the drug, lot and control number equivalent, expiration date and/or, if applicable, a BUD.

Dispensing of Medications  
 
Medications must be dispensed by the hospital in a manner that is safe and meets the 
needs of the patient:  
 
• Quantities of medications are dispensed which minimize diversion and potential 
adverse events while meeting the needs of the  patient;  
 
• Medications are dispensed in a timely manner. The hospital must have a system that ensures that medication orders get to the pharmacy and medications get back 
to patients  promptly;  
 
• Whenever possible, medications are dispensed in the most ready to administer 
form available from the manufacturer or, if feasible, in unit dose that have been repackaged by the  pharmacy;  
 
• The hospital consistently uses the same dose packaging system, or, if a different 
system is used, provides education about the use of the dose packaging system;  
 
• All concerns, issues or questions are clarified with the individual prescriber before dispensing;  and 
• Medications dispensed by the hospital are retrieved when recalled or discontinued 
by the manufacturer or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for safety  
reasons.  
 
Medications must be available for administration to patients when needed, including 
when the pharmacy is not open. Methods to accomplish this when the pharmacy is not open could include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: automated dispe nsing units outside the pharmacy, night cabinets, contracted services after hours via 
telepharmacy contracting, on- call pharmacists, etc.  
• Automated Dispensing Cabinets (ADCs) for medications are a secure option for medication storage since they ensure locked storage of medications and allow for electronic tracking of controlled substances and other drugs. These cabinets often have embedded s ecurity features, such as login and password or biometric 
identification so that they can only by accessed by authorized personnel.  
 
• Policies and procedures must address who can access medications during after - 
hours. 
 
Survey Procedures §482.25(b)(1)  
 
• Determine that only pharmacists or pharmacist- supervised personnel compound, 
package and dispense drugs or biologicals in accordance with State and Federal laws 
and regulations and accepted standards of practice  by:  
For Information Only  
 
Certain provisions of the FDCA address the labeling of prescription drugs generally 
(e.g., section 503(b)(2) of the FDCA). Section 503B of the FDCA includes labeling requirements for drugs compounded by registered outsourcing facilities (see section 503B(a)(10)). Although hospitals are expected to comply with these requirements, surveyors conducting a Medicare survey do not assess compliance with other Federal laws.  
 
• Interviewing pharmacy and hospital staff to determine who prepares and 
dispenses drugs and biologicals;  
 
• Observing on site preparation and dispensing operations;  
 
• Inspecting drug storage  areas.  
• Can the hospital demonstrate that compounded medications used and/or dispensed by the hospital are being compounded consistent with standard operating procedures and quality assurance practices? Can the pharmacy director provide evidence that compounded me dications used and/or dispensed by the hospital are 
being compounded consistent with standard operating procedures and quality assurance practices?  
 
• If the hospital obtains compounded products from external compounding sources, are the external source(s) registered with the FDA as outsourcing facilities? If not, 
can the hospital demonstrate that it systematically evaluates and monitors whether the outside compounding pharmacy adheres to accepted standards for safe compounding?   
• Can the pharmacy director explain the risk level(s) of the CSPs being produced in-house and/or obtained from external sources? 
 
 
• If any CSPs are produced in the  hospital:  
 
• Ask for one or more examples of situations in which a BUD had to be determined for a compounded sterile medication (CSP) based on the policy. Interview pharmacy personnel assigned to carry out this function within the hospital and/or to assess how this is done by external source(s) of CSPs. Is there evidence that the BUDs are determined consistent with the hospital’s policies and  procedures?  
 
• Interview staff who engage in sterile and non- sterile compounding. Are they 
knowledgeable about applicable levels of aseptic practices?  
 
• Ask the pharmacy director to demonstrate how the following are 
accomplished to ensure that sterile compounding practices are consistent with standards for the risk level(s) of CSPs being produced for/dispensed to hospital  patients:  
 
• Verification of compounding accuracy and  sterility; 
 
• Environmental quality and controls, including environmental sampling; testing and monitoring; and cleaning and disinfection;  
 
• Personnel training and competency assessment, including but not limited to accuracy/precision in identifying and measuring ingredients; cleansing and garbing; aseptic manipulation skills; environmental quality and disinfection; appropriate work practices within and adjacent to the direct compounding area; verification/calibration  of 
equipment; sterilization; and post- production quality checks.  
 
• Review the hospital’s procedures for maintaining the quality of CSPs during storage, transport and dispensing. Are CSPs packaged in a manner to protect package integrity and sterility? How are CSP -specific requirements with respect 
to motion, light exposure, temperature and potentially hazardous contents 
addressed? How does the hospital ensure that such information is effectively 
conveyed to non- pharmacy health care personnel and/or to patients/caregivers, if  
applicable?  
 
• Can the hospital document that it is systematically monitoring and tracking adherence to all of  the quality assurance and personnel training and competency 
standards described above? Have any problems or risks been identified? If so, did the hospital take effective action to protect patients, if relevant, and to effectively remedy the problem/risk?

§482.25(b)(2)(i) - All drugs and biologicals must be kept in a secure area, 
and locked when appropriate.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.25(b)(2)(i)  
 A secure area means that drugs and biologicals are stored in a manner to prevent unmonitored access by unauthorized individuals.  Drugs and biologicals must not be stored in areas that are readily accessible to unauthorized persons.  For example, if medications are kept in a private office, or other area where patients and visitors are not allowed without the supervision or presence of a health care professional (for example, ambulatory infusion), they are considered secure.  Areas restricted to authorized personnel only would generally be considered “secure areas.”  If there is evidence of tampering or diversion, or if medication security otherwise becomes a problem, the hospital is expected to evaluate its current medication control policies and procedures , and implement the necessary systems 
and processes to ensure that the problem is corrected, and that patient health and safety are maintained.  (71 FR 68689)  
 All controlled substances must be locked.   Hospitals are permitted flexibility in the storage of non- controlled drugs and biologicals when delivering care to patients, and in the 
safeguarding of drugs and biologicals to prevent tampering or diversion.  An area in which staff are actively providing care to patients or preparing to receive patients, i.e., setting up for procedures before the arrival of a patient, would generally be considered a secure area.   When a patient care area is not staffed, both  controlled and non- controlled substances are 
expected to be locked.  
 Generally labor and delivery suites and critical care units are staffed and actively providing patient care around the clock, and, therefore, considered secure.  However, hospital policies and procedures are expected to ensure that these areas are secure, with entry and exit 
limited to appropriate staff, patients and visitors.  
 
The operating room suite is considered secure when the suite is staffed and staff are actively providing patient care.  When the suite is not in use (e.g., weekends, holidays and after hours), it would not be considered secure.  A hospital may choose to lock the entire suite, lock non- mobile carts containing drugs and biologicals, place mobile carts in a locked 
room, or otherwise lock drugs and biologicals in a secure area.  If an individual operating room is not in use, the hospital is expected to lock non- mobile carts, and ensure mobile 
carts are in a locked room. (71 FR 68689)  
 This regulation gives hospitals the flexibility to integrate patient self -administration of non-
controlled drugs and biologicals into their practices as appropriate.  When a hospital allows a patient to self -administer selected drugs and biologicals, the hospital authorizes the patient 
to have access to these medications.   This regulation is consistent with the current practice 
of giving patients access at the bedside to urgently needed medications, such as 
nitroglycerine tablets and inhalers.  It supports the current practice of placing selected 
nonprescription medications at the bedside for the patient’s use, such as lotions and creams, and rewetting eye drops.  Hospitals are expected to address patient self -administration of 
non-controlled drugs and biologicals in their policies and procedures (see self -
administration discussion at §§482.23(c)(6)(i) and 482.23(c)(6)(ii)).  This  regulation 
supports hospital development, in collaboration with the medical staff and the nursing and pharmacy departments, of formal patient medication self -administration programs for select 
populations of patients, including hospital policies and proce dures necessary to ensure 
patient safety and security of medications.   The policies and procedures are expected to include measures to ensure the security of bedside drugs and biologicals.  They are also expected to address both the competence of the pati ent to self -administer drugs and 
biologicals as well as patient education regarding self -administration of drugs and 
biologicals. (71 FR 68689)  
 Due to their mobility, mobile nursing medication carts, anesthesia carts, epidural carts and other medication carts  containing drugs or biologicals (hereafter, all referred to as “carts”) 
must be locked in a secure area when not in use.  Hospital policies and procedures are expected to address the security and monitoring of carts, locked or unlocked, containing drugs a nd biologicals in all patient care areas to ensure their safe storage and to ensure 
patient safety.  (71 FR 68689)  
 Medication automated distribution units with security features, such as logon and password or biometric identification, are considered to be locked, since they can only be accessed by authorized personnel who are permitted access to the medications.  Such units must be stored in a secure area.  
 Survey Procedures §482.25(b)(2)(i)  
 
• Review hospital policies and procedures governing the security of drugs and 
biologicals to determine whether they provide for securing and locking as 
appropriate;  
 
• Review hospital policies and procedures governing patient self -administration of 
drugs and biologicals;  
 
• Observe whether medications in various areas of the hospital are stored in a secure area, and locked when appropriate.  Are medication storage areas periodically inspected by pharmacy staff to make sure medications are properly stored?  
 
• Determine that security features in automated medication distribution units are 
implemented and actively maintained, e.g., that access authorizations are regularly 
updated to reflect changes in personnel, assignments, etc. 
 
• Interview staff to determine whether policies and procedures to restrict access to 
authorized personnel are implemented and effective;  
 
• If patient self -administration of drugs and biologicals is permitted, interview 
patients and staff to determine whether policies and procedures are implemented and 
effective.

§482.25(b)(2)(ii) -  Drugs listed in Schedules II, III, IV, and V of the Comprehensive 
Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 must be kept locked within a secure 
area.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.25(b)(2)(ii)  
 All Schedule II, III, IV, and V drugs must be kept locked within a secure area.  A secure area means the drugs and biologicals are stored in a manner to prevent unmonitored access by unauthorized individuals.  Medication automated distribution units with l ogon and 
password/biometric identification are considered to be locked, since they can only be accessed by authorized personnel who are permitted access to Schedule II – V  medications.  
 Mobile nursing medication carts, anesthesia carts, epidural carts and other medication carts  
containing Schedule II, III, IV, and V drugs must be locked within a secure area.  
 Survey Procedures §482.25(b)(2)(ii)  
 
• Determine whether there is a hospital policy and procedure that requires Schedule 
II, III, IV, and V drugs to be kept in a locked storage area.  
 
• Observe in various parts of the hospital whether Schedule II, III, IV and V drugs are locked and stored in a secure area..  
 
• Determine whether security features in automated medication distribution units are implemented and actively maintained, e.g., that access authorizations are regularly 
updated to reflect changes in personnel, assignments, etc. 
 
• Interview staff to determine whether policies and procedures to restrict access to 
authorized personnel are implemented and effective.

§482.25(b)(2)(iii) -  Only authorized personnel may have access to locked areas.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.25(b)(2)(iii)  
 
The hospital must assure that only authorized personnel may have access to locked areas where drugs and biologicals are stored.   
 A hospital has the flexibility to define which personnel have access to locked areas, based on the hospital’s needs as well as State and local law.  For example, a hospital could include within its definition of “authorized personnel” ancillary support per sonnel, such as 
engineering, housekeeping staff, orderlies and security personnel as necessary to perform their assigned duties.  The hospital’s policies and procedures must specifically address how “authorized personnel” are defined for purposes of this s ection.  It is not necessary for the 
policy to name specific authorized individuals, but the policy should be clear in describing the categories of personnel who have authorized access, as well as whether there are different levels of access authorized in different areas of the hospital, or at different times of day, or for different classes of drugs and biologicals, etc.  The hospital’s policies and procedures must also address how it prevents unauthorized personnel from gaining access to locked areas where drugs and biologicals are stored. Whenever unauthorized personnel have access, or could gain access, to those locked a reas, 
the hospital is not in compliance with this requirement and is expected to re -evaluate and 
tighten its security measures.  
  Survey Procedures §482.25(b)(2)(iii)   
 
• Determine whether there is a hospital policy and procedure defining authorized 
personnel that are permitted access to locked areas where drugs and biologicals are 
stored. 
 
• Determine whether there is a hospital policy and procedure for limiting access to locked storage areas to authorized personnel only.  
 
• Observe whether or not access to locked storage areas is limited to personnel 
authorized by the hospital’s policy.

 §482.25(b)(3) -   Outdated, mislabeled, or otherwise unusable drugs and biologicals 
must not be available for patient use.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.25(b)(3)  
 The hospital must have a pharmacy labeling, inspection, and inventory management system that ensures that outdated, mislabeled, or otherwise unusable drugs and biologicals are not available for patient use.  This would include drugs that are the subject of a manufacturer’s recall.  
 A drug or biological is outdated after its expiration date, which is set by the manufacturer based on stability testing under specified conditions as part of the FDA approval process.  It should be noted that a drug or biological may become unusable prior to its expiration date if it has been subjected to conditions that are inconsistent with the manufacturer’s approved labeling.  A drug or biological is also outdated after its “beyond- use date” (BUD), which may be 
reached before the expiration date, but never later.  The BUD takes into account the specific conditions and potential for deterioration and microbial growth that may occ ur during or 
after the original container is opened, while preparing the medication for dispensing and administration, and/or during the compounding process if it is a compounded medication.  
  The BUD is to be based on information provided by the manufacturer, whenever such 
information is available.  The hospital must maintain and implement policies and procedures that provide clear and consistent direction to pharmacy staff regarding how to determine a BUD when complete BUD information is not available from the manufacturer.  
The policies and procedures must be based on accepted professional principles.   For individual drug containers:  each floor stock drug container is expected to be labeled with the name and strength of the drug, lot and control number equivalent, and expiration date.  Appropriate accessory and cautionary statements are included as well  as the 
expiration date and/or, if applicable, a BUD.  In addition, where applicable, each patient’s individual drug container is expected to be labeled with the patient’s full name and quantity of the drug dispensed.  
 If the unit dose system is utilized, each single unit dose package is expected to be labeled with the name and strength of the drug, lot and control number equivalent, expiration date and/or, if applicable, a BUD.  Survey Procedures §482.25(b)(3)  
 
• Spot-check the labels of individual drug containers to verify that they conform to 
Federal and State laws, and/or contain the following minimal information:  
 
• Each patient’s individual drug container bears his/her full name, and strength 
and quantity of the drug dispensed.  Appropriate accessory and cautionary statements are included as well as the expiration date and/or, if applicable, a BUD;  
 
• Each floor stock container bears the name and strength of the drug, lot and control number of equivalent, expiration date;  
 
• If the unit dose system is utilized, verify that each single unit dose package bears 
name and strength of the drug, lot and control number equivalent, expiration date 
and/or, if applicable, a BUD;  
 
• Inspect patient -specific and floor stock medications to identify expired, mislabeled or 
unusable medications.

§482.25(b)(4) -  When a pharmacist is not available, drugs and biologicals must be 
removed from the pharmacy or storage area only by personnel designated in the policies of the medical staff and pharmaceutical service, in accordance with Federal and State l aw. 
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.25(b)(4)  
 Routine after -hours access to the pharmacy by non -pharmacists for access to medication 
should be minimized and eliminated as much as possible. The use of well -designed night 
cabinets, after -hours medication carts, and other methods may preclude the need for non -
pharmacist to enter the pharmacy.  Policies and procedures should be consistent with Federal and State Law.  
 If an urgent or emergent patient need occurs, the hospital must be able to provide medications to the patients in its facility.  
 The hospital must have a process for providing medications to meet patient needs when the pharmacy is closed.  
 When non- pharmacist health care professionals are allowed by law and regulation to obtain 
medications after the pharmacy is closed, the following safeguards are applied:  
 
• Access is limited to a set of medications that has been approved by the hospital.  These medications can be stored in a night cabinet, automated storage and distribution device, or a limited  section of the pharmacy.  
 
• Only trained, designated prescribers and nurses are permitted access to medications. 
 
• Quality  control procedures (such as an independent second check by another 
individual or a secondary verification built into the system, such as bar coding) are 
in place to prevent medication retrieval errors.  
 
• The hospital arranges for a qualified pharmacist to be available either on- call or at 
another location (for example, at another organization that has 24- hour pharmacy 
service) to answer questions or provides medications beyond those accessible to 
non-pharmacy staff.  
 
• This process  is evaluated on an on- going basis to determine the medications 
accessed routinely and the causes of accessing the pharmacy after hours.  
• Changes are implemented as appropriate to reduce the amount of times non-
pharmacist health care professionals are obtaining medications after the pharmacy is 
closed.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.25(b)(4)  
 
• Determine through pharmacy records that when the pharmacist is not available, drugs are r emoved from the pharmacy (drug storage area) only by a designated 
individual (in accordance  with State law if applicable) and only in amounts 
sufficient for immediate therapeutic needs.  
 
• Review policies and procedures to determine who is designated to remove drugs and 
biologicals  from the pharmacy or storage area and the amount a non- pharmacist 
may remove in the absence of a pharmacist.  The individual(s) designated should be 
identified by name and qualifications. 
 
• Determine that a system is in place that accurately documents the removal of medications (type and quantity) from either the pharmacy or the after hours supply.  
 
• Determine that the pharmacist reviews all medication removal activity and correlates the removal with current medication orders in the patient medication profile.  
 
• Determine if the pharmacist routinely reviews the contents of the after -hours supply 
to determine if it is adequate to meet the after -hours needs of the hospital.

§482.25(b)(5) - Drugs and biologicals not specifically prescribed as to time 
or number of doses must automatically be stopped after a reasonable time 
that is predetermined by the medical staff.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.25(b)(5)  
 In accordance with accepted standards of practice, the medical staff, in coordination and consultation with the pharmacy service, determines and establishes the reasonable time to 
automatically stop orders for drugs and biologicals not specifically prescribed as to time or 
number of doses.  The hospital must implement, monitor, and enforce this automatic stop system . 
 It is important to note that hospitals with an electronic health record (EHR) system may have time and dose parameters automatically built into computerized provider order entry (CPOE) screens.  These may be part of the hospital’s plan for addressing autom atic stop 
orders.  
 Survey Procedures §482.25(b)(5)  
 
• Review policies and procedures to determine that there is a protocol established by 
the medical staff to discontinue and review patients’ medical records to determine 
compliance with stop -order policy;  
 
• Ask unit staff what happens in the case of drugs with no stop date or prescribed 
number of doses.  Are they aware of the automatic stop policy?  Can they describe 
how it is enforced?

§482.25(b)(6) -  Drug administration errors, adverse drug reactions, and 
incompatibilities must be immediately reported to the attending physician and, if appropriate, to the hospital’s quality assessment and performance improvement program .   Interpretive Guidelines §482.25(b)(6)  
 Hospitals are required to ensure that the attending physician is made immediately aware of drug administration errors, adverse drug reactions, and incompatibilities.  When the attending physician is unavailable, the covering physician must be notified.  When the covering physician must be notified, the patient’s attending physician must be notified as soon as he/she is available.   In addition, when appropriate, such events must also be reported to the hospital -wide Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) 
program.  
 The hospital must adopt policies and procedures that identify the types of events that must be reported immediately to the attending physician, as well as those to be reported to the QAPI program.  
 
• Drug administration error:  
 
The National Coordinating Council Medication Error Reporting and Prevention definition of a medication error is “Any preventable event that may cause or lead to 
inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the health care professional, patient, or consumer.  Such events may be related to professional practice, health care products, procedures, and systems, including prescribing; order communication; product labeling, packaging, and nomenclature; compounding; dispensing; distribution; administration; education; monitoring; and use.”  In the context of this regulation, however, “drug administration error” is limited to those errors in administration that ac tually reach the patient, i.e., a 
medication actually is administered to a patient when it should not be, or the wrong dose is administered, or the wrong root of administration is used, etc., or a medication that should have been administered to the patient has not been administered in a timely manner, as discussed in the medication administration standard at 42 CFR 482.23(c).  
 
• Adverse drug reaction:  
 
The American Society of Health -System Pharmacists (ASHP) defines an adverse 
drug reaction (ADR) as “Any unexpected, unintended, undesired, or excessive response to a drug that:  
 
1. Requires discontinuing the drug (therapeutic or diagnostic)  
2. Requires changing the drug therapy  
3. Requires modifying the dose (except for minor dosage adjustments)  
4. Necessitates admission to a hospital 
5. Prolongs stay in a health care facility  
6. Necessitates supportive treatment  
7. Significantly complicates diagnosis  
8. Negatively affects prognosis, or  
9. Results in temporary or permanent harm, disability, or death.   
 
Consistent with the definition, an allergic reaction (an immunologic hypersensitivity occurring as the result of unusual sensitivity to a drug) and an idiosyncratic reaction (an abnormal susceptibility to a drug that is peculiar to the individual) are also considered ADRs.”  
 
• Drug incompatibilities  
 
A drug incompatibility occurs when drugs interfere with one another chemically or physiologically.  Drugs known to be incompatible must not be mixed, administered together, or administered within a timeframe where they will interfere with each other.  When IV medications are administered with known incompatibilities, an error has occurred and it needs to be reported to the attending physician immediately.  Any unexpected reaction that occurs between IV medications not previously identified as incompatib le also needs to be reported.   
 
Hospitals can minimize the risk of administering incompatible medications by 
making available pertinent resources, such as drug incompatibility charts and online 
incompatibility references.  The incompatibility information needs to be readily available to staff administering medications.  The information needs to be kept up-to-date as the information is frequently updated by drug manufacturers.  
 
The immediate reporting requirement applies to drug administration errors, adverse drug reactions or incompatibilities that have harmed or have the potential to harm the patient.  If 
the outcome of the drug administration error is unknown, the physician must also be notified without delay.  Drug administration errors that result in no or insignificant harm to the patient must also be documented in the medical record but do not require immediate reporting to the attending physician.  For example, if an analgesic dose is missed during the night shift, it can be reported first thing in the morning.  Hospital staff is expected to use their clinical judgment, based on patient presentation and assessment in accordance with hospital policy and procedures, to determine whether immediate reporting is r equired.  
 On the other hand, for purposes of reporting to the hospital’s QAPI program, hospitals must, in accordance with the requirements of the QAPI CoP at 42 CFR 482.21(c)(2),  track and report not only the errors that cause or risk harm to the patient, but also those which do not.  Such “near misses” and suspected ADRs may reveal important information about systems vulnerabilities that the hospital should address in order to avoid events that result in harm.  
 Hospitals must establish policies and procedures for reporting of medication errors, ADRs, and incompatibilities, and ensure that staff is aware of the reporting process.  For those events that require immediate reporting, the hospital’s policies must esta blish timeframes 
for reporting that are based on the clinical effect of the error on the patient.  
 To improve staff willingness to report medication error incidents, hospitals are encouraged to adopt a non- punitive approach that focuses on system issues rather than individual health 
care professionals.  A non -punitive approach is likely to encourage reporting by those who 
otherwise may fear retribution or hospital disciplinary action.  
 In addition to employing broad definitions of medication errors and ADRs for QAPI tracking purposes and encouraging the reporting of medication errors, ADRs and drug incompatibilities, the hospital must take additional steps to identify these events as par t of 
its QAPI program where medical errors and adverse patient events are measured, analyzed 
and tracked.  Reliance solely on incident reporting fails to identify the majority of errors 
and adverse reactions.  Proactive identification includes observation of me dication passes, 
concurrent and retrospective review of a patient’s clinical records, ADR surveillance team, implementation of medication usage evaluations for high- alert drugs, and identification of 
indicator drugs that, when ordered, automatically genera te a drug regimen review for a 
potential adverse drug event.   
 The hospital must have a method by which to measure the effectiveness of its systems for identifying and reporting to the QAPI program medication errors and ADRs.  Such methods could include use of established benchmarks for the size and scope of services provided by the hospital, or studies on reporting rates published in peer -reviewed journals.  Hospitals are 
encouraged, and may be required by State law, to participate in statewide and national reporting of drug administration errors, adverse drug reactions, and incompatibilities.  National organizations include, but are not limited to, the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) MedWatch Reporting Program and the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) Medication Errors Reporting Program.      Survey Procedures §482.25(b)(6)  
 
• Does the hospital have policies and procedures that define medications errors, ADRs, and drug incompatibilities?  Do they address the circumstances under which they must be reported immediately to the attending physician, as well as to the hospital’s QAPI program?  Do they address how reporting is to occur?  
 
• Are all medication errors and suspected ADRs promptly recorded in the patient’s medical record, including those not subject to immediate reporting?  
 
• If upon review of a sample of records, a suspected ADR or medication error is identified, determine if it was reported immediately to the attending or covering physician, in accordance with the hospital’s written policies and procedures.  If it is reported  to a covering physician, determine if it was also reported to the attending 
physician when he/she became available.  
 
• Ask hospital staff what they do when they become aware of a medication error, ADR or drug incompatibility.  Are staff aware of and do they follow the hospital’s policy and procedures?  
 
• Ask hospital staff how they manage drug incompatibilities.  What tools do they use in the clinical setting to minimize the risk of incompatibilities?  How is the information related to drug incompatibilities made available to the clinical staff administering IV medications (posters, online tools, etc.)?  How often is the information updated to ensure accuracy?  
 
• Interview hospital staff to ascertain awareness of the hospital’s policy on reporting 
and documentation of medication errors and adverse drug reactions.   
 
• How does information regarding medication errors, adverse drug reactions, and 
incompatibilities get reported to the hospital QAPI program?  Ask staff to speak to the process.   
 
• For QAPI reporting purposes, is the hospital’s definition of an ADR and medication error based on national standards?

§482.25(b)(8) - Information relating to drug interactions and information 
of drug therapy, side effects, toxicology, dosage, indications for use, and 
routes of administration must be available to the professional staff.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.25(b)(8)  
 The pharmacy must be a resource for medication- related information to the hospital’s 
health -care practitioners and other health care personnel to optimize therapeutic outcomes 
and minimize adverse drug events.  Information must be available concerning drug 
interactions and information of drug therapy, side effects, toxicology, dosage, indications 
for use, and routes of administration.  The pharmacy may also assist other health care professionals with the following medication- related functions:   
 
• Collection and organization of patient -specific information (height, weight, 
allergies);  
• Identification of the presence of medication -therapy problems, both potential and 
actual, such as drug -drug interactions, excessive doses;  
 
• Identification and specification of pharmaco- therapeutic goals;  
 
• Implementation of a monitoring plan in collaboration with the patient, if applicable, and other health- care professionals;  
 
• Monitoring the effects of the pharmacotherapeutic regimen – could include 
adjusting doses based on lab values (i.e.: Coumadin dosing); or  
 
• Redesigning the regimen and monitoring plan as indicated.  
 For example, practitioners may write an order for “pharmacy to dose” an antibiotic.  The pharmacist would then take patient -specific information, review the patient’s current 
medication therapies for any problems, and then calculate the dose required to me et 
therapeutic goals.   Increasingly, as hospitals move to computerized physician- order entry (CPOE) of 
medication orders, much of this consultation function (e.g.; dosage, path of administration, drug- drug interactions and other contraindications, etc.) is built in to the electr onic health 
record (EHR) system.  However, the pharmacy service remains responsible for the provision of accurate, up -to-date information to meet the needs of the hospital’s 
practitioners, nursing staff and patients.  
 The hospital must also have immediately available sufficient up -to-date reference material 
on drug therapy, whether in electronic or hard copy format.  A pharmacist also should be readily available by telephone or other means to respond to questions from practitioners and nursing personnel.  
 Survey Procedures §482.25(b)(8)  
 
• Is drug information readily available to nurses and practitioners, whether in hard copy or electronic format?  
 
• If drug information is built in to the hospital’s EHR system, ask the pharmacy 
director how the hospital ensures that the information is accurate and up- to-date;  
 • Ask practitioners whether needed reference information is available to them when 
prescribing drugs;  
 
• Ask nursing staff whether needed reference information is available to them when 
administering drugs or biologicals and when monitoring patients for effects of 
medication therapies.

§482.25(b)(9) -  A formulary system must be established by the medical staff to assure 
quality pharmaceuticals at reasonable costs.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.25(b)(9)  
 The medical staff must establish a formulary system.  The formulary lists medications for dispensing or administration that the hospital maintains or that are readily available.  In accordance with accepted standards of practice, the medical staff, in cons ultation with the 
pharmacy service, should develop written criteria for determining what medications are available for dispensing or administration.  At a minimum, the criteria include the indication for use, effectiveness, risks (including propensity for medication errors, abuse potential, and sentinel events), and costs.  
 
Processes and mechanisms should be established to monitor patient responses to a newly 
added medication before the medication is made available for dispensing or administration 
within the hospital.  
 
Medications designated as available for dispensing or administration are reviewed periodically based on emerging safety and efficacy information.  The hospital should have processes to approve and procure medications that are not on the hospital’s medication list.  
 The hospital should have processes to address medication shortages and outages, including the following:  
 
• Communicating with appropriate prescribers and staff;  
 
• Developing approved substitution protocols;  
 • Educating appropriate LIPs, appropriate health care professionals, and staff about 
these protocols; and  
 
• Obtaining medications  in the event of a disaster.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.25(b)(9)  
 
• Interview  the pharmacist to determine that the medical staff has established a 
formulary that lists drugs that actually are available in the hospital.  
 
• Interview the Pharmacy Director to determine that there is a process for creation and 
periodic review of a formulary system. 
 
• Determine that the formulary lists drugs that are available.

§482.26 Condition of Participation: Radiologic Services   
The hospital must maintain, or have available, diagnostic radiologic services. If 
therapeutic services are also provided, they, as well as the diagnostic services, must meet professionally approved standards for safety and personnel qualifications.   Interpretive Guidelines §482.26   
Hospitals must offer diagnostic radiologic services and may also offer therapeutic 
radiologic services.  No matter where they are furnished in the hospital (including all departments on all campuses and off -site locations) radiologic services must satisfy 
professionally approved standards for safety and personnel qualifications.  Hospitals are expected to take a consistent approach in their policies and procedures for radiologic services safety and personnel qualifications throughout the hospital.  This may be accomplished in several ways, including by having one organized radiologic service under the direction of the radiologist who supervises all ionizing radiology services (see §482.26(c)(1)), or by the governing body ensuring a uniform approach to radiol ogic 
services that are offered in multiple departments of the hospital. .  The elements of the Condition’s regulatory language (the Condition “stem” statement) are close, but not identical, to those found in the standards at §§482.26(a) and (b).  We have, therefore, repeated elements of this Condition regulatory language in the T ags for both 
§§482.26(a) and (b), in order to permit citation of deficiencies that are specific to 
requirements found in the Condition stem statement at either the standard or condition 
level, as appropriate.   The manner or degree of noncompliance with the requirement s of 
this Condition and its component standards must be evaluated to determine whether there is substantial noncompliance with the Condition, warranting a Condition- level citation.  
 
What is included in Radiologic Services?  
 Radiologic services encompass many different modalities used for the purpose of diagnostic or therapeutic medical imaging and radiation therapy.  Each type of technology yields different information about the area of the body being studied or treated, related to possible disease, injury, or the effectiveness of medical treatment.  All the modalities use some form of radiation, which is a term for energy waves or particles that pass through a medium, such as light or radio signals through the air.  Some of these modalities (radiography, computed tomography, fluoroscopy) utilize ionizing radiation, which has enough energy to potentially cause damage to DNA,  while others (ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging) use other forms of non-ionizing radiation to view the human body in order to diagnose, monitor, or treat medical conditions.    Most of the definitions and terms referred to in this guidance are based on technical information available on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) website, located at http://www.fda.gov/Radiation- EmittingProducts/default.htm
 or from the Radiologic 
Society of North America’s (RSNA) website, located at http://www.radiologyinfo.org  . 
Diagnostic & Therapeutic Radiologic Services  
Diagnostic and therapeutic radiologic services may use the same modalities, but for different purposes. Diagnostic services are performed to determine a specific cause of the medical problem with which the patient presents (e.g., fractured bone, occluded a rtery, 
tumor), while therapeutic services are performed to treat a specific problem (e.g., stenting of an artery or embolization of a blood vessel, lithotripsy of a renal stone, external beam radiation therapy to a cancerous tumor).  Regardless of the purpose of the radiologic services, the risks to the patient and staff, if applicable, depend on the modality used, the length of the study/procedure, the size of the patient, the specifics of the device being used, and other factors.  Modalities that use Ionizing Radiation  Radiography (X -rays) is a technique for generating and recording an x-ray pattern for the 
purpose of providing the user with a static image(s) after termination of the exposure.  During a radiographic procedure, an x-ray beam is passed through the body.  A portion of the x -ray is absorbed or scattered by the body’s internal structure and the remaining x- ray 
pattern is transmitted to a detector, so that an image may be recorded for later evaluation.  The recording of the pattern may occur on film or through electronic means (digital).  X -
rays are used to diagnose or treat patients by displaying images of  the internal structure(s) 
of the body to assess the presence or absence of disease, foreign objects, and structural damage or anomaly. 
Some common examples include: 
• Verification of correct placement of invasive catheters, tubes, or devices;  
• Orthopedic evaluations for fractured or dislocated bones; 
• Chest x -ray to identify common conditions, such as congestive heart failure or 
pneumonia;  
• Evaluations of radio-opaque foreign bodies in soft tissues; and 
• Mammography. 
Dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry  (DEXA) is a form of medical imaging that uses very 
small amounts of ionizing radiation to measure bone mineral density and determine an 
individual’s risk for bone fractures or establish the diagnosis of osteoporosis.  The amount of radiation used is less than one -tenth the dose of a traditional chest X -ray and less than 
one day’s exposure to natural radiation.  
Computed Tomography (CT) scanning, also called computerized axial tomography (CAT) scanning, is a medical imaging procedure that uses x- rays to show cross -sectional 
images of the body.  A CT imaging system produces cross -sectional images or "slices" of 
areas of the body, like the slices in a loaf of bread.  During a CT scan, a patient undergoes several consecutive and simultaneous X -rays that can be configured as a three dimensional 
reconstruction of the part of the body that is being imaged.  Thus, a CT sc an delivers more 
ionizing radiation to the patient than radiography.  CTs are better able to distinguish between different types of tissues in the body than radiography and, given its ability to image large areas over a short period of time, CT offers significantly improved resolution of many different structures in a variety of spatial configurations. Often a CT scan will be performed using x -ray dye or contrast agent, which can be administered by mouth or by 
vein.  This technique further helps to identify the intestines or vasculature, which can assist with the diagnosis of disease or injury.  
Some common examples include:  
• CT of the brain to distinguish between an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke;  
• CT of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate for internal bleeding following trauma;  
• CT of the chest to determine the presence of a pulmonary embolus; and  
• CT of the aorta with intravenous contrast agent to determine a ruptured aneurysm. 
Fluoroscopy is a type of medical imaging that shows a continuous x- ray image on a 
monitor, much like an x- ray movie.  It is used to diagnose or treat patients by displaying the 
movement of a body part, or of an instrument or x -ray dye (contrast agent) through the 
body.  
Fluoroscopy is used in many types of examinations and procedures. Some examples 
include:  
• Barium upper GI (gastrointestinal) series and enemas (to view movement through the GI tract);  
• Catheter insertion (to direct the placement of a catheter in a blood vessel);  
• Orthopedic surgery (to view fracture treatments);  and  
• Angiography (to determine if there are blockages in arteries).  
The amount of ionizing radiation that a patient and the medical staff receive during the procedure depends on the procedure’s length and complexity.  
Radiation Therapy  
Ionizing radiation can also be used for therapeutic purposes, in which the energy is utilized 
to directly kill cancerous cells.  
External beam therapy (EBT) is a method to deliver a beam of high- energy x -rays to a 
patient’s tumor.  The beam is generated outside the patient and is targeted at the tumor site.  
The goal is to deposit the energy to kill the cancer cells while sparing the normal tissue. EBT i s often used to treat cancers of the breast, head and neck, prostate, lung, and brain.  It 
also can be used to provide palliative care for painful sites of metastases to bone. 
Brachytherapy  is a type of radiation therapy in which radioactive material is placed 
directly inside or next to the tumor.  This type of therapy allows for a higher dose of 
radiation to treat a smaller area and in a shorter time than with EBT.  It can be either tempora ry, in which the radioactive material is placed inside or near a tumor for a specified 
amount of time, often via a catheter; or permanent, in which radioactive seeds or pellets are placed near or inside a tumor and left there permanently, eventually decaying so that the radioactivity diminishes to nothing. Brachytherapy is often used to treat solid tumors, including prostate, breast, and gallbladder cancer.   
Radiologic Services modalities that do not use ionizing radiation  
Ultrasound  
Ultrasound imaging (sonography) uses high- frequency sound waves to view soft tissues, 
such as muscles and internal organs.  Because ultrasound images are captured in real -time, 
they can show movement of the body's internal organs as well as blood flowing t hrough 
blood vessels. This imaging modality has no documented evidence of dangers to the patient or staff administering it, however, caution about the frequency of use has been encouraged, particularly in the imaging of fetuses.  Ultrasound imaging is used in many types of examinations and procedures. Some examples include:  
• Doppler ultrasound (to visualize blood flow through a blood vessel);  
• Echocardiogram (to view the heart);  
• Fetal ultrasound (to view the fetus in pregnancy);  
• Ultrasound- guided biopsies of suspicious masses;  
• Doppler fetal heart rate monitors (to listen to the fetal heart beat); and  
• Lithotripsy to break up kidney stones; this procedure uses high energy sound waves (shock waves), but there is minimal risk to the patient and staff from this form of energy.  Pre - and post -procedure radiographs are taken of the patient, which confer the 
same risk as a standard X -ray of that part of the body. 
Magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) is a medical imaging procedure that uses strong 
magnetic fields and radio waves to produce cross -sectional images of organs and internal 
structures in the body. Because the signal detected by an MRI machine varies depending on the water content and local magnetic properties of a particular area of the body, different tissues or substances can be distinguished from one another in the study image.  
MRI can give different information about structures in the body than can be obtained using a standard x -ray, ultrasound, or computed tomography (CT) exam. For example, an MRI 
study of a joint can provide detailed images of ligaments and cartilage, which ar e not 
visible using other modalities. In some cases, an MRI contrast agent is given by vein to show internal structures or abnormalities more clearly.  
In most MRI devices, an electric current is passed through coiled wires to create a temporary magnetic field in a patient’s body. (In open- MRI devices, permanent magnets are 
used.) Radio waves are sent from and received by a transmitter/receiver in the machine, and these signals are used to produce digital images of the area of interest. 
MRI scans facilitate diagnosis or monitoring of treatments for a variety of medical 
conditions, including:  
• Abnormalities of the brain and spinal cord;  
• Tumors, cysts, and other abnormalities in various parts of the body;  
• Injuries or abnormalities of the joints;  
• Certain types of heart problems;  
• Diseases of the liver and other abdominal organs;  
• Causes of pelvic pain in women (e.g., fibroids, endometriosis); and  
• Suspected uterine abnormalities in women undergoing evaluation for infertility.

[§482.26 Condition of Participation: Radiologic Services  
 
The hospital must maintain, or have available, diagnostic radiologic services...]  
 §482.26(a) Standard: Radiologic Services  
 
The hospital must maintain, or have available, radiologic services according to the needs of the patients.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.26 (a)  
 Mandatory and Optional Radiologic Services  
 The hospital must maintain, or have available, diagnostic radiological services according to the needs of the volume and types of patients the hospital serves.  “Maintain” in this context means furnishing radiologic services on -site, while having them available means providing 
access to radiologic services even when they are not furnished on- site.   For example:  
 
• It would not be uncommon for a psychiatric hospital to maintain on- site relatively 
limited or no radiologic services, while making more extensive diagnostic services 
available under arrangement, at a site outside the psychiatric hospital.  
• On the other hand, a short -term acute care hospital with a busy emergency department 
that handles trauma, stroke, and other complex medical and surgical cases would be expected to maintain on- site a wider range of diagnostic radiologic services that are 
ready to be furnished w hen needed.  
 
A hospital’s diagnostic radiologic services must be maintained or available at all times.  Multi- campus hospitals must have diagnostic radiologic services that can be furnished when 
needed in a clinically appropriate timeframe for each location providing i npatient, same -day 
surgery, and emergency services.  The scope and complexity of diagnostic radiological services maintained or available must be specified in writing, in order to demonstrate how the hospital meets the needs of its patients.  
 Therapeutic radiologic services are optional, but if they are offered, must also comply with the Radiologic Services requirements.  
    Radiological services may be provided by the hospital directly utilizing its own staff, or through a contractual arrangement.  The hospital is responsible for ensuring that the services meet all the requirements of this regulation, regardless of whether th ey are 
provided directly or under arrangement.  Diagnostic radiologic services provided under arrangement may be provided either on the hospital’s campus or in an adjacent or other 
nearby, readily accessible facility so long as the services, including those required on an 
urgent or emergent basis, can be furnished within clinically appropriate timeframes. 
 
Increasingly, hospitals are also separating the performance of radiologic studies, which may be done on- site or at a readily accessible facility off the hospital’s campus, from the 
interpretation of the studies, which can be performed remotely by a teleradiology practitioner in a timely fashion.  This practice is acceptable, so long as the teleradiology practitioner is privileged in accordance with the requirements of the Governing Body (§482.12) and Medical Staff (§482.22) CoPs.  Survey Procedures §482.26(a)  
 
• With respect to assessing whether the diagnostic radiologic services meet the needs of 
the hospital’s patients:  
• Ask the hospital for evidence of the scope and complexity of its diagnostic 
radiologic services.  
 
• Ask how the hospital has determined that the services meet the needs of its patients.  
 
• Verify that the hospital either maintains or makes available diagnostic radiologic 
services that can be provided promptly when needed. 
 
• If the hospital has an emergency department, are diagnostic radiologic services maintained or available at all times to support the emergency department?   
 
• If the diagnostic radiologic services are not on the same campus as the hospital’s emergency department, same- day surgery, inpatient locations, or other areas where 
services dependent upon radiologic services are provided, ask the hospital how it ensures t hat services are furnished within clinically required timeframes.  Does the 
hospital have an arrangement with an off -site facility to furnish diagnostic services 
when needed?  
 
• How does the hospital ensure that staff authorized to interpret diagnostic studies are ready to furnish services within clinically required timeframes, either on -site or 
through telecommunications media that permit remote review and interpretation of studi es?

[§482.26 Condition of Participation: Radiologic Services  
 
…. If therapeutic services are also provided, they, as well as the diagnostic services, 
must meet professionally approved standards for safety and personnel qualifications.]  
 
§482.26(b) Standard: Safety for Patients and Personnel  
 
  The radiologic services, particularly ionizing radiology procedures, must be free from hazards for patients and personnel.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.26(b)  
The hospital must adopt and implement radiologic services policies and procedures that 
provide safety for affected patients and hospital personnel and which are consistent with 
accepted professional standards for radiologic services. 
Ionizing Radiology Procedures 
Radiologic services modalities that use ionizing radiation have increased the ability to 
detect disease or injury early enough for a medical problem to be managed, treated, or cured.  When applied and performed appropriately, these radiologic studies or procedures can maintain or improve health and save lives. 
X-ray energy used in radiologic services also has a potential to harm living tissue. The most 
significant risks are:  
• Cataracts and skin damage, but only at very high levels of radiation exposure; and   
• An increase in the possibility that a person exposed to x-ray energy will develop cancer later in life.  The risk of developing cancer from radiologic services radiation exposure is generally very small, and it depends on at least three factors—the amount of the 
radiation dose, the age of the person exposed, and the sex of the person exposed: 
• The lifetime risk of cancer increases the larger the dose and the more x -ray studies 
or procedures a patient undergoes;  
• The lifetime risk of cancer is larger for a patient who received x -rays at a younger 
age than for one who receives them at an older age; and.  
• Women are at a somewhat higher lifetime risk than men for developing radiation -
associated cancer after receiving the same exposures at the same ages.  
 MRI:  
MRIs are useful when a soft tissue injury or disease process is suspected and are generally considered at low risk of causing harm to patients or staff.  However, they also are not 
entirely risk -free.  Potential risks include projectile risk of magnetic objects being sucked 
into the main magnet, thermal injury and burns, adverse effects on devices and leads 
implanted in patients, and hearing damage.  
Provision of services  in accordance with professionally approved standards for safety  
 
All radiological services provided by the hospital, including both diagnostic and, if offered, therapeutic services, must be provided in accordance with acceptable standards of practice, including standards for safety.  
 
Professionally approved standards include maintaining compliance with applicable Federal and State laws and regulations governing radiological services, including, but not limited to, facility licensure and/or certification requirements.    Professionally approved standards also include the recommendations or guidelines promulgated by expert governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as well as those issued by nationally recognized professional organizations, such as the American Medical Association, American College of Radiology, Radiological Society of North America,  The Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging,  American Society of Radiologic Technologists,  the American College of Cardiology, the Ameri can College of Neurology, the American College of Physicians, etc.   
 Generally, there are different standards for different imaging modalities used to provide radiologic services; there may also be different standards for diagnostic versus therapeutic uses, as well as for pediatric versus adult patients, etc.  For example, the American College of Radiology has separate diagnostic radiology guidance documents for general radiology, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, among others.  The hospital must be able to document the source 
standards that form the basis for its policies and procedures for each of its radiologic 
services modalities and/or settings.  For example, if one organization’s standards are used 
for mammography services, another’s for CT services, another’s for MRI, and another’s for pediatric X -rays, this must be clearly indicated.  
 In order to  ensure safety and freedom from hazards, the hospital’s radiologic services 
policies and procedures must include, but are not limited to, provisions addressing the following:  
 
• For ionizing radiation services, application of the fundamental principle of As Low as 
Reasonably Achievable or ALARA, which is defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as “A principle of radiation protection philosophy that requires that exposures to ionizing radiation be kept as low as reasonably achievable, economic and social factors being taken into account.  The protection from radiation exposure is ALARA when the expenditure of further resources would be unwarranted by the reduction in exposure that would be achieved.” (Federal Guidance Report No. 14, Radiation Protection Guidance for Diagnostic and Interventional X -ray Procedures, 
p. 100, November, 2014)  Although CMS does not interpret or enforce EPA guidance, the ALARA principle is  considered an accepted standard of practice for ionizing 
radiation services to which hospitals must adhere.  
 
• Written protocols developed or approved by the radiologist responsible for the 
radiologic services, in conjunction with other qualified radiologic services personnel (e.g., a medical physicist, radiologic technologists, patient safety officers, etc.) designed to ensure that diagnostic studies and therapeutic procedures are routinely performed in a safe manner, utilizing parameters and specifications that are appropriate to the ordered study/procedure.  The hospital must ensure that protocols for the various  types of 
ionizing radiation diagnostic or therapeutic imaging modalities are designed to minimize the amount of radiation while maximizing the yield and producing 
diagnostically acceptable image quality.  Existing protocols must be reviewed periodically a nd updated as needed.  The rationale and details for changes to technical 
parameters must be documented.

Hospitals are encouraged to follow the recommendation in the EPA’s Guidance  
Report No. 14 concerning patient radiation dosage.  The report says “As the ICRP 
[International Commission on Radiological Protection] has stated, ‘Provided that the 
medical exposures of patients have been properly justified and that the associated 
doses are commensurate with the medical purpose, it is not appropriate to apply dose 
limits or dose constraints to the medical exposure of patients, because such limits or 
constraints would often do more harm than good’ (ICRP 2007b).   While dose limits 
do not apply to medical exposures, radiation doses to patients should always be 
optimized.  All responsible parties should always strive to minimize patient 
irradiation to the dose that is necessary to perform the procedure with adequate image 
quality.  The recommendation against establishing absolute dose limits should 
not discourage a facility from implementing diagnostic reference levels for 
imaging and interventional procedures. Exceeding these levels should prompt a 
review of practice at the facility  as a quali ty assurance measure. Dose 
notification and alert values for CT, notification levels for use during 
interventional procedures, and trigger levels for follow -up after interventional 
procedures are also appropriate QA measures  [emphasis added] ...(EPA Guidance 
Report No. 14, p.6) 
 
 
• Policies and protocols to identify patients at high risk for adverse events for whom the 
radiologic study or procedure might be contraindicated, e.g., pregnant women, individuals with known allergies to contrast agents, individuals with implanted devices, etc.  Policies would address the steps to be taken, and by which personnel, if an order is written for a radiologic study or procedure for an individual identified in the radiologic services policies as potentially at high risk (e.g., notify the ordering physician, cancel the procedure personally, etc.).  
• Specific requirements related to procedures to mitigate radiation hazards are discussed in the guidance for §482.26(b)(1).   
 
• Procedures to address risks associated with modalities that do not use ionizing radiation.  
For example, with respect to MRI:  
 
• Measures to prevent magnetic materials from being closer than is safe to the MRI 
suite, per nationally recognized guidelines;   
• If equipment and supplies, such as fire extinguishers and oxygen tanks, are 
located in the MRI area, they are MR -safe, i.e., they are non- ferromagnetic;  
 
• Provision of adequate and effective hearing protection to patients, staff and others who might be in the MRI suite while the scans are taking place; and  
• Measures to reduce the risk of thermal injuries/burns during MRI. This would include, but is not limited to, screening patients to identify those who may have metallic tattoos or metal in them, proper patient positioning, ensuring implants are MR Conditional, checking for electrically conductive materials that might be in close proximity to the patient and taking the appropriate precautions, and instructing the patient to immediately report any burning sensations experienced during the scan.  
 
• Training required by personnel permitted to enter areas where radiologic services are 
provided. 
 
• Training and, as applicable, qualifications, required for personnel who perform 
diagnostic imaging studies or therapeutic procedures utilizing radiologic services equipment.  This includes proper operation of equipment per manufacturer’s instructions and hospital policy.  
• Areas where radiologic services are provided must be equipped with the necessary equipment or materials to immediately respond to potential adverse events.  This could include, but is not limited to, things like a crash cart, emergency stop mechanisms, cleaning and decontamination agents if applicable, etc. 
 
 
For Information Only – Not Required/Not to be Cited  
Hospitals are encouraged to also address the following in their Radiologic Services: 
• Encouraging physicians and other practitioners with privileges to order radiologic 
studies or procedures that utilize ionizing radiation to consider both the benefits and 
risks of the procedures.  
 
• Recording and tracking the dosing patients receive.  There are several nationally 
recognized quality assurance programs designed to assist health care providers in 
developing and maintaining this data, including, but not limited to: 
 
• The Alliance for Safety in Pediatric Imaging ( www.Imagegently.org )  
• The Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors 
• The American College of Radiology data registry (http://nrdr.acr.org)  
• The Nationwide Evaluation of X-ray Trends (NEXT program) 
 
Further, although the EPA’s Guidance Report No. 14 was developed by an Interagency 
Working Group on Medical Radiation specifically to provide guidance to Federal 
facilities that use diagnostic and interventional X -ray equipment, it should also be useful 
to non- Federal medical facilities and hospitals are encouraged to review it.  The 
Guidance Report addresses the following topics: 
 
• Radiation Safety Standards and General Concerns 
• Structural Shielding and Door Interlock Switches 
• Requesting and Performing Studies Involving X- rays 
• Technical Quality Assurance  
• General Guidelines for Clinical Imaging, organized into separate sections for Medical 
and Dental, and further broken down by modality 
• Imaging Informatics  
• Recommendations for Facility Action  
 
 Medical Physicists  
 According to the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, the practice of Medical Physics means the use of principles and accepted protocols of physics to ensure the correct quality, quantity, and placement of radiation during the performance of a radiological procedure.  Hospitals are not required under the regulations to have a medical physicist on staff or under contract.  However, since radiologic services are required to be free from hazards to patients and hospital personnel, hospitals must ensure that qualified personnel, whether or not they are medical physicists, develop and carry out protocols and test, calibrate, and maintain radiologic services equipment and that there is a reliable means to validate the results.

Definition of a Medical Physicist  
 
An example of a definition of and qualifications for a medical physicist is provided by 
the American Association of Physicists in Medicine: 
 
“For the purpose of providing clinical professional services, a Qualified Medical 
Physicist (QMP) is an individual who is competent to independently provide clinical 
professional services in one or more of the subfields1 of medical physics. The subfields of 
medical physics are:  
• Therapeutic Medical Physics  
• Diagnostic Medical Physics  
• Nuclear Medicine Physics  
• Medical Health Physics  
 
…. A Qualified Medical Physicist meets each of the following credentials: 
• Has earned a master’s and/or doctoral degree in physics, medical physics, biophysics, 
radiological physics, medical health physics, or equivalent disciplines from an 
accredited college or university; and

The responsibilities of the medical physicist in a hospital may include:  
 
• protection of the patient and others from potentially harmful or excessive radiation; 
• establishment, with the approval of the Director of Radiologic Services, of adequate 
protocols to ensure accurate patient dosimetry;  
• measurement and characterization of radiation;  
• determination of delivered dose;  
• promotion of procedures necessary to ensure image quality;  
• development and direction of quality assurance programs; and assistance to other 
healthcare professionals in optimizing the balance between the beneficial and 
deleterious effects of radiation.   
 
Hospitals are also encouraged to involve a medical physicist in the calibration of the 
radiologic services equipment and monitoring of radiation dosage exposures to staff.    
 
 
Consistent with the requirements under the Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) CoP at 42 CFR 482.21, the hospital must monitor the quality and safety of radiologic services.    Examples of indicators of potential quality and safety problems could include, but are not limited to:  
 
• Improper patient preparation, such as inadequate intravenous access or lack of pre -
medication, such that procedures must be cancelled or reordered;  
 
• Repeats of the same studies in the hospital for the same patient within a short time 
span, which may be an indicator of poor image quality; or  
 
• Diagnostic imaging studies or therapeutic procedures performed in a manner inconsistent with the applicable hospital written protocol.   
 Under the QAPI CoP, hospitals are required to undertake improvement activities in areas that represent high risk, high volume, or problem -prone areas.  Problems identified in 
radiologic services may meet these criteria.  In addition, adverse events related  to radiologic 
services must be analyzed for their causes, and preventive actions must then be undertaken.  
Deficiencies identified related to tracking, analyzing, and addressing adverse event and 
quality indicator data and performance improvement activities must be cited under the applicable QAPI standards.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.26(b)  
 
• Verify that there are written hospital policies and procedures and protocols for specific 
radiologic services modalities that are based on identified professionally approved 
standards, and which address the ALARA principle as well as the other safety and r isk-
reduction measures discussed in the guidance.  
 
• Ask for evidence that safety protocols are reviewed periodically and, if applicable, 
updated.  
 
• Determine if the radiologic services staff are familiar with the policies and procedures 
related to safety in general and specific clinical protocols.  
 
• Observe whether the policies and procedures are followed when radiologic services are 
delivered to patients.  Ask for the protocol(s) for one or more studies/procedure(s) you observed and check if they were followed.  
 
• Verify that radiologic services staff are trained at appropriate intervals to ensure that they are operating the equipment according to manufacturer’s instructions and hospital policy 
 
• Verify that radiologic services staff know how to respond to adverse events.  
 
• Confirm that areas where radiologic services are provided are equipped with the equipment or materials to immediately respond to an adverse event. 
 
• Ask the radiologist who supervises ionizing radiologic services how the hospital 
monitors the quality and safety of radiologic services.  
 
• Verify that adverse events are analyzed for their causes and that preventive actions are taken (deficiencies to be cited both here and under the applicable QAPI citation).

hazards. This includes adequate shielding for patients, personnel, and facilities, as well as appropriate storage, use and disposal of radioactive materials.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.26(b)(1)  
 
The hospital must adopt and implement written policies and procedures to ensure safety from radiation hazards.  The policies and procedures must include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following:   
• Clear and easily recognizable signage identifying hazardous radiation  areas; 
 
• Limitations on access to areas containing radiologic services equipment.   
 
• Appropriate use of shielding, including: 
 
•  Types of personal protective shielding (e.g., lead aprons, lead gloves, protective 
eyewear, thyroid shields, portable individualized lead panels, stationary barriers) to 
be used, under what circumstances, for patients, including high- risk patients as 
identified in radiologic services policies and procedures, patient family members or 
support persons who may be needed to be with the patient during a study or procedure, and hospital personnel;  
• Lead and concrete barriers built into the walls and other structures of the imaging areas;  
 
• Identification and use of appropriate containers to be used for various radioactive materials, if applicable, when stored, in transport between locations within the hospital, in use, and during/after disposal.

The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) has requirements for 
protecting hospital staff from radiation exposure, some of which are summarized below: 
 
• “For information about exposure limits see:  29 CFR 1910.1096, Ionizing Radiation 
Standard.  The standard also requires: 
 
• Each radiation area shall be conspicuously posted with a sign or signs bearing the 
radiation caution symbol, with the wording ‘Caution Radiation Area’ [29 CFR 
1910.1096(e)(2)]” 
 
 
 
 
 
This document also discusses other tools to prevent radiation exposure. 
 
See:  
https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hospital/clinical/radiology/radiology.html#Radiation   
 
As a reminder, although hospitals are required to comply with applicable OSHA 
requirements, surveyors conducting surveys on behalf of CMS do not interpret or assess 
compliance with the requirements of OSHA or other Federal Agencies.  Surveyors do 
assess co mpliance with Medicare requirements that may overlap or duplicate OSHA 
requirements.  
 
 
  

Survey Procedures §482.26(b)(1)  
 
• Verify that personal shielding, supplies  and equipment are properly maintained and 
routinely inspected by the hospital.  
 
• Determine if the proper shielding is applied to a patient who is undergoing a procedure 
using ionizing radiation.   
 
• Determine if staff members appropriately extricate themselves from the immediate 
exposure field while performing a study or procedure using ionizing radiation.  
 
• Determine if staff wear shielding as appropriate, per hospital policy. 
 
• Verify that any hazardous radiation materials are clearly labeled, properly stored in a 
safe manner in the requisite containers, and disposed of in the appropriate manner.

§482.26(b)(2) -  Periodic inspection of equipment must be made and hazards identified 
must be properly corrected.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.26(b)(2)  
 The hospital must have policies and procedures in place to ensure that periodic inspections of radiology equipment are conducted, current and that problems identified are corrected in a timely manner.  Equipment includes not only devices used to deliver di agnostic or 
therapeutic radiologic services, but also exposure meters, badges, or personal radiation monitoring devices used by staff, as well as equipment the hospital uses to inspect or calibrate devices used to deliver diagnostic or therapeutic radiologic services.  The hospital must ensure that equipment is inspected in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions and Federal and State laws, regulations, and guidelines, and hospital policy, as applicable.  Inspections and maintenance, including correction of identified hazards, must be performed by qualified employees (e.g., medical physicists, qualified biomedical technicians, etc.) or through contractual arrangements with vendors with appropriate expertise.  
 
Hospitals must follow the manufacturer’s instructions as to how to inspect and maintain radiologic equipment.  This includes acceptance testing (i.e., upon initial installation and after major upgrades) as well as ongoing inspection and maintenance.  Documentation of preventive maintenance, quality control tests, service records, and major software/hardware upgrades must be maintained by t he hospital and be readily available for inspection. 
 The hospital must also have a system in place, to identify and remedy equipment hazards in a timely manner.  This system must include, but is not limited to:  periodic and consistent calibration of equipment and, for equipment using ionizing radiation, monitoring of dosimetry parameters with phantoms to ensure that an accurate dose of radiation is delivered per the applicable protocol.  In addition, hospitals must also have a system to track all modifications made to the equipment that would significantly i mpact the accuracy 
of the dosage delivered.  Any adverse events related to over - or under -dosing must be 
identified and addressed.

Requirements for Manufacturers Re: Instructions that Must be Made Available 
 
Below is an FDA summary of its requirements for manufacturers of x-ray systems to 
make available to purchasers and, upon request, to other parties, information related to 
maintenance of the following types of systems: 
 
• For all diagnostic x-ray systems, manufacturers are required to provide to purchasers,

(Rev. 141, Issued: 07-10-15, Effective: 07-10-15, Implementation: 07-10-15)   §482.26(b)(3) - Radiation workers must be checked periodically, by the use of exposure meters or badge tests, for amount of radiation exposure.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.26(b)(3)   This requirement applies to radiologic services personnel, as well as other hospital employees who may be regularly exposed to radiation due to working near radiation sources. This could include certain nursing and maintenance staff.  The types or locations of employees who require monitoring for radiation exposure must be identified in the policies 
and procedures for the radiologic services developed or approved by the radiologist who 
supervises the services, in conjunction with the appropriately qualified radiation safety 
personnel.  The monitoring of staff exposure must be documented by qualified personnel.   Hospitals are expected to educate staff who are monitored for radiation exposure about the appropriate use of the monitoring meters or badges (or through use of a “personal radiation monitoring device,” which employs modern technology for the same measurement purpose).  Hospitals must educate staff on the importance of tracking their radiation exposure over various timeframes, such as the most recent month and year, as well as their cumulative exposure through work.  Staff also must be educated about the appropriate storage of the meters and/or badges as well as the procedures to follow if the exposure device exceeds cumulative dosage parameters specified per hospital policy.  The hospital is expected to proactively monitor staff cumulative dosage and take appropriate steps if an individual staff member’s cumulative dosage level exceeds parameters specified per hospital policy.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has requirements for 
protecting hospital staff from radiation exposure, some of which are summarized below: 
 
• “For information about exposure limits see:  29 CFR 1910.1096, Ionizing Radiation 
Standard.  The standard also requires: 
 
• …Every employer shall supply appropriate personnel monitoring equipment, such 
as film badges, pocket chambers, pocket dosimeters, or film rings, and shall 
require the use of such equipment [29 CFR 1910.1096(d)(2)] 
 
• Employers shall maintain records of the radiation exposure of all employees for 
whom personnel monitoring is required under paragraph (d) of this section and 
advise each employee of his individual exposure at least yearly…

As a reminder, although hospitals are required to comply with applicable OSHA 
requirements, surveyors conducting surveys on behalf of CMS do not interpret or 
assess compliance with the requirements of OSHA or other Federal Agencies.  
Surveyors do assess compliance with Medicare requirements that may overlap or 
duplicate OSHA requirements.  
 
 
Survey Procedures §482.26(b)(3)   
• Verify that staff being monitored have been trained about the appropriate use and 
storage of their badges/meters.  Are staff knowledgeable about their personal radiation 
exposure over various timeframes? 
 
• Observe whether staff in categories or locations identified for monitoring have radiation -detecting meters or badges and that they appropriately wear and store them.  
 
• Review records to verify that monitoring of staff exposure is documented.  
 
• Ask the hospital what steps it takes if staff exposure exceeds parameters established 
per hospital policy.  Can the hospital provide examples, or, if it asserts there have been no cases in the prior 12 – 24 months, do its records support this?

(Rev. 141, Issued: 07-10-15, Effective: 07-10-15, Implementation: 07-10-15)   §482.26(b)(4) - Radiologic services must be provided only on the order of practitioners with clinical privileges or, consistent with State law, of other practitioners authorized by the medical staff and the governing body to order the services.   Interpretive Guidelines §482.26(b)(4)  The medical staff and the governing body determine the necessary qualifications and clinical privileges that practitioners must have to order diagnostic radiologic studies or therapeutic procedures.  
 For outpatient services, the governing body and medical staff may also authorize practitioners who do not have hospital privileges to order such studies or procedures, as permitted under State law.    For example, a hospital may decide that it will routine ly accept 
orders from physicians in the communities it services for outpatient diagnostic studies, regardless of whether those physicians have privileges to practice in the hospital.  See the guidance for §482.54(c) for more information on requirements related to outpatient orders from practitioners who do not hold privileges to practice at the hospital.  The order must include information for the radiologic technologist about the study or procedure to be performed, and the technologist is expected to review this information prior to implementing the order.   
 
 
 
For Information Only – Not Required/Not to be Cited  
Hospitals are strongly encouraged, but not required, to develop standard formats for 
practitioner’s orders for radiologic services that clearly document the diagnostic or 
therapeutic purpose of the study/procedure, as well as any other pertinent information 
that may lead to altering the dose of radiation, including, but not limited to: 
• Indication (reason) for the study/procedure 
• Previous imaging studies of the body part(s) under investigation; 
• Additional relevant radiation exposure; and 
• Previous adverse events (e.g., over- or underexposure of dosing, allergic reaction to 
contrast dye) during radiologic procedures. 
 
In addition, hospitals are encouraged to adopt policies to ensure that the radiation 
technologist performing the study/procedure confirms the order with the ordering 
practitioner if there are any concerns about its appropriateness. 
 
 
Survey Procedures §482.26(b)(4)   
•  Review medical records to determine that there is an order for all radiologic services, 
and that the order was dated/timed and authenticated by an authorized practitioner prior to the diagnostic study or therapeutic procedure being performed.   
Observe whether a radiologic technologist confirms that there is an order from an authorized practitioner and reviews information included in the order before beginning a study or procedure.

(Rev. 141, Issued: 07-10-15, Effective: 07-10-15, Implementation: 07-10-15)   
§482.26(c) – Standard:  Personnel  
 (1) A qualified full -time, part- time  or consulting radiologist must supervise the 
ionizing radiology services and must interpret only those radiologic tests that are determined by the medical staff to require a radiologist’s specialized knowledge. For purposes of this section, a radiologist is a doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is qualified by education and experience in radiology.   Interpretive Guidelines §482.26(c)(1)  
 The regulation defines a radiologist as a doctor of medicine (MD) or doctor of osteopathy (DO) who is qualified by education and experience in radiology.  The medical staff must establish the specific criteria related to education and experience that must be met in order to be privileged as a radiologist in the hospital.  Ionizing radiologic services offered throughout the hospital must be under the supervision of a radiologist, who may be part- time, full-time, or consulting.  This may be accomplished 
in several ways, including by having one organized radiologic service under the direction of the supervising radiologist, or by the governing body ensuring a uniform approach to ionizing radiologic services that are offered in multiple, separately organized departments of the hospital which collaborate with the supervising radiologist in developing their department -specific protocols for ensuring that these services are free from hazards for 
patients and personnel.   
The supervising radiologist, including, if applicable, a consultant who provides such 
supervision, must be privileged as a radiologist at the hospital.  The extent of radiologic 
services provided by the hospital determines whether the supervising radiologi st must carry 
out these responsibilities full or part -time.   
 For diagnostic radiologic services using ionizing radiation, policies and procedures must, in addition to the requirements addressed in other portions of the radiologic services CoP, identify which types of radiologic tests require interpretation by a radi ologist, as opposed to 
another type of practitioner holding privileges; the hospital’s medical staff must approve this policy.  
 When interpretation of radiologic tests (studies) is provided via telemedicine, the radiologist interpreting the radiological test must be licensed and/or meet the other applicable standards that are required by State or local laws in the state where the h ospital 
(and, therefore, the patient) is located.  The requirements concerning granting of privileges to teleradiologists are addressed in the medical staff (§482.22) and governing body (§482.12) Conditions of Participation.   Survey Procedures §482.26(c)(1)  
 
• Review the medical staff privileging criteria for a radiologist.  Review the credentialing and privileging file of the supervising radiologist to verify that he or she meets the qualifications established by the medical staff and has been granted privilege s as a radiologist. 
 
• If the supervising radiologist is a part -time employee or consultant, ask him/her 
how much time/week is spent on supervising ionizing radiologic services.   
 
• Is there any evidence of problems within the radiologic services that suggest 
lack of supervision?  
 
• Determine whether the medical staff has reviewed and approved a policy identifying the types of diagnostic radiologic tests (studies) that require interpretation by a radiologist.  Review records to determine that a radiologist interprets those tests 
(stud ies) that have been designated.

§482.26(c)(2) -  Only personnel designated as qualified by the medical staff may use the 
radiologic equipment and administer procedures.   Interpretive Guidelines §482.26(c)(2)  
 The medical staff must develop policies, consistent with State law, that govern the designation of all personnel who are qualified to use the radiologic equipment and perform diagnostic or therapeutic studies or procedures.  Qualifications must include appropriate training and demonstrated competence in the use of equipment and administration of procedures prior to being designated as qualified.  Only designated individuals may use the equipment and perform studies or procedures.  
 
The use of the radiologic equipment includes, but is not limited to, functions such as 
operating the equipment according to the manufacturer’s instructions and hospital policy, and interfacing with specialized technology as needed.    In addition to a radiologist, and although not specifically mentioned in the regulations, radiologic technologists are typically involved in the delivery of radiologic services in a 
hospital.  Radiologic technologists are medical personnel who typically perform diagnostic 
imaging examinations and administer radiation therapy treatments, as permitted under State 
law. They are educated in anatomy, patient positioning, examination techni ques, equipment 
protocols, radiation safety, radiation protection, and basic patient care.   All radiologic technologists using radiologic equipment or performing studies/procedures must be designated to do so. 
 Personnel also need to know how to respond to adverse events that may occur during a radiologic study or procedure.   
 Hospitals are expected to regularly reassess staff competency and to provide periodic training needed to keep staff skills up- to-date.  The hospital must document training 
completion dates and evidence of satisfactory competence.  Staff that complete train ing but 
cannot demonstrate satisfactory competence must not be permitted to use radiologic equipment and/or administer procedures.  
 Survey Procedures §482.26(c)(2)  
 
• Verify that the medical staff established criteria for personnel who use radiologic 
services equipment and perform studies or procedures.  
 
• Determine which staff are using which pieces of radiological equipment.  Review their 
personnel folders to determine if they meet the qualifications established by the medical staff for the tasks they perform.  
 
• Verify that radiologic services staff are periodically trained and reassessed for competence to ensure that they are operating the equipment according to manufacturer instructions and hospital policy and know how to respond to adverse events related to their use of the equipment.

§482.26(d) Standard: Records  
 
Records of radiologic services must be maintained.  
 (1) - The radiologist or other practitioner who performs radiology services must sign 
reports of his or her interpretations.   (2) - The hospital must maintain the following for at least 5 years:  
(i)  Copies of reports and printouts.  
(ii) Films, scans, and other image records, as appropriate.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.26(d)  
The hospital must maintain records for all radiologic procedures performed.  At a minimum, the records must include the orders for the services, copies of reports and printouts, and any films, scans, digital or other image records, as appropriate.   Radiology films, image records, scans, digital files, reports, and printouts must be secure and properly stored for at least five years.  If State law requires a longer period, the hospital must comply, but surveyors do not assess compliance with State law  requirements as part of 
the Federal survey.  Patient radiologic services records are considered patient medical records and the hospital must comply with the requirements of the medical records CoP (§482.24).  All reports of studies must be signed by the radiologist or other authorized practitioner (in the case of studies not designated as requiring a radiologist to interpret 
them) who reads and evaluates the findings of the study.  Acceptable forms of signature 
include paper signatures as well as electronic signatures.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.26(d)  
 
• Determine whether the hospital maintains radiologic services records for at least 5 years after the study or procedure.  (Assess them for compliance with the Medical Records CoP at §482.24 at the same time, but make sure to cite general medical record noncompliance under that CoP.)  
 
• Request records for all different imaging modalities furnished by the hospital, to determine if the procedure for maintaining the records is consistent among all the radiologic services.  
 
• Review radiologic records to determine that reports of studies are signed by the radiologist or other authorized practitioner (in the case of studies not designated as requiring a radiologist to interpret them ) who read and evaluated the findings of the study

§482.27(b) Standard: - Potentially Infectious Blood and Blood 
Components  
 
(1)Potentially  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectious blood and blood 
components.  Potentially HIV infectious blood and blood components are prior collections from a donor –  
(i) Who tested negative at the time of donation but tests reactive for 
evidence of HIV infection on a later donation;  
(ii) Who tests positive on the supplemental (additional, more specific) test or 
other follow -up testing required by FDA; and 
 (iii) For whom the timing of seroconversion cannot be precisely estimated.  
 
(2)  Potentially hepatitis C virus (HCV) infectious blood and blood components.  
Potentially HCV infectious blood and blood components are the blood and blood components identified in 21 CFR 610.47. 
 (3)  Services furnished by an outside blood collecting establishment.  If a hospital regularly uses the services of an outside blood collecting establishment, it must have an agreement with the blood collecting establishment that governs the procurement, transfer, and availability of blood and blood components .  The 
agreement must require that the blood collecting establishment notify the hospital -- 
 
(i) Within 3 calendar days if the blood collecting establishment supplied blood and blood components collected from a donor who tested negative at the time of donation but tests reactive for evidence of HIV or HCV 
infection on a later donation or who is determ ined to be at increased risk 
for transmitting HIV or HCV infection;  
 (ii) Within 45 days of the test, of the results of the supplemental (additional, more specific) test for HIV or HCV, as relevant, or other follow -up testing 
required by FDA;  
 (iii) Within 3 calendar days after the blood collecting establishment supplied blood and blood components collected from an infectious donor, 
whenever records are available, as set forth at 21 CFR 610.48(b)(3).  
 
(4) Quarantine of blood and blood components pending completion of testing.  If the 
blood collecting establishment (either internal or under an agreement) notifies the hospital of the reactive HIV or HCV screening test results, the hospital must determine the disposition of the blood or blood component and quarantine all blood and blood components from previous donations in inventory.  
 
(i)  If the blood collecting establishment notifies the hospital that the result of the supplemental (additional, more specific) test or other follow -up testing 
required by FDA is negative, absent other informative test results, the 
hospital may release the blood and blood components from quarantine. 
 
(ii) If the blood collecting establishment notifies the hospital that the result of 
the supplemental (additional, more specific) test or other follow -up testing 
required by FDA is positive, the hospital must –  
 
(A)  Dispose of the blood and blood components; and  
(B) Notify the transfusion recipients as set forth in paragraph 
(b)(6) of this section.  
 (iii) If the blood collecting establishment notifies the hospital that the result of the supplemental (additional, more specific) test or other follow -up testing 
required by FDA is indeterminate, the hospital must destroy or label prior collections of blood or blood components held in quarantine as set forth at 21 CFR 610.46(b)(2), 610.47(b)(2), and 610.48(c)(2).  
(5)  Recordkeeping by the hospital.  The hospital must maintain -- 
 
(i)  Records of the source and disposition of all units of blood and blood components for at least 10 years from the date of disposition in a manner that permits prompt retrieval; and  
 (ii)  A fully funded plan to transfer these records to another hospital or 
other entity if such hospital ceases operation for any reason. 
 
(6) Patient notification. If the hospital has administered potentially HIV or HCV infectious blood or blood components (either directly through its own blood collecting establishment or under an agreement) or released such blood or blood components to another entity or appropriate individual, the hospital must take the following actions:  
 
(i)   Make reasonable attempts to notify the patient, or to notify the 
attending physician who ordered the blood or blood component and ask the physician to notify the patient, or other individual as permitted under paragraph (b)(10) of this section,  that potentially HIV or HCV infectious blood or blood components were transfused to the patient and that there may be a need for HIV or HCV testing and counseling.  
 
(ii)  If the physician is unavailable or declines to make the notification, 
make reasonable attempts to give this notification to the patient, legal guardian or relative. 
 
(iii) Document in the patient’s medical record the notification or attempts to 
give the required notification.  
 
(7) Time frame for notification.  For donors tested on or after February 20, 2008.  
For notifications resulting from donors tested on or after February 20, 2008 as set 
forth at 21 CFR 610.46 and 21 CFR 610.47 the notification effort begins when the 
blood collecting establishment notifies the hospital that it received potentially HIV or 
HCV infectious blood and blood components.  The hospital must make reasonable attempts  to give notification over a period of 12 weeks unless -- 
 
(i) The patient is located and notified; or  
(ii) The hospital is unable to locate the patient and documents in the patient’s medical record the extenuating circumstances beyond the hospital’s control that caused the notification timeframe to exceed 12 weeks.  
 
(8) Content of notification. The notification must include the following information:  
 
(i)   A basic explanation of the need for HIV or HCV testing and 
counseling.  
 
(ii)  Enough oral or written information so that an informed decision can be made about whether to obtain HIV or HCV testing and counseling.  
 
(iii) A list of programs or places where the person can obtain HIV or HCV testing and counseling, including any requirements or restrictions the program may impose.  
 (9)  Policies and procedures. The hospital must establish policies and procedures for 
notification and documentation that conform to Federal, State, and local laws, including requirements for the confidentiality of medical records and other patient information.  
 (10) Notification to legal representative or relative. If the patient has been adjudged 
incompetent by a State court, the physician or hospital must notify a legal representative designated in accordance with State law. If the patient is competent, but State la w permits a legal representative or relative to receive the information on 
the patient’s behalf, the physician or hospital must notify the patient or his or her legal representative or relative. For possible HIV infectious transfusion recipients that are d eceased, the physician or hospital must inform the deceased patient’s legal

§482.28 Condition of Participation:  Food and Dietetic Services  
 
The hospital must have organized dietary services that are directed and staffed by adequate qualified personnel.  However, a hospital that has a contract with an outside food management company may be found to meet this Condition of Participation if the co mpany has a dietician who serves the hospital on a full -time, part -time, or 
consultant basis, and if the company maintains at least the minimum standards specified in this section and provides for constant liaison with the hospital medical staff for recomm endations on dietetic policies affecting patient treatment.  
 Interpretative Guidelines §482.28  
 The hospital’s food and dietetic services must be organized, directed and staffed in such a manner to ensure that the nutritional needs of the patients are met in accordance with practitioners’ orders and acceptable standards of practice.  
 
The hospital should have written policies and procedures that address at least the following:  
 
• Availability of a diet manual and therapeutic diet menus to meet patients’ nutritional 
needs;  
 
• Frequency of meals served;  
 • System for diet ordering and patient trays delivery;  
 • Accommodation of non- routine occurrences (e.g., parenteral nutrition (tube 
feeding), total parenteral nutrition, peripheral parenteral nutrition, change in diet 
orders, early/late trays, nutritional supplements, etc);  
 
• Integration of the food and dietetic service into the hospital -wide QAPI and 
Infection Control programs;  
 • Guidelines for acceptable hygiene practices of food service personnel; and  
 • Guidelines for  kitchen sanitation. 
 
The same standards apply whether the food and dietetic services are provided by the 
hospital directly, through a contractual agreement, or by off -site vendor.   
 The hospital must be in compliance with Federal and State licensure requirements for food and dietary personnel as well as food service standards, laws and regulations.

§482.28(a)(2) - There must be a qualified dietitian, full -time, part -time or on a 
consultant basis.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.28(a)(2)  
 
A qualified dietitian must supervise the nutritional aspects of patient care.  Responsibilities of a hospital dietitian may include, but are not limited to:  
• Approving patient menus and nutritional supplements;  
 
• Patient, family, and caretaker dietary counseling;  
 • Performing and documenting nutritional assessments and evaluating patient 
tolerance to therapeutic diets when appropriate;  
 
• Collaborating with other hospital services (e.g., medical staff, nursing services, 
pharmacy service, social work service, etc) to plan and implement patient care as 
necessary in meeting the nutritional needs of the patients;  
 
• Maintaining pertinent patient data necessary to recommend, prescribe, or modify 
therapeutic diets as needed to meet the nutritional needs of the patients.  
 Qualification is determined on the basis of education, experience, specialized training, State licensure or registration when applicable, and maintaining professional standards of practice.  
 If the qualified dietitian does not work full -time, and when the dietitian is not available, the 
hospital must make adequate provisions for dietary consultation that meets the needs of the patients.  The frequency of consultation depends on the total numbe r of patients, their 
nutritional needs and the number of patients requiring therapeutic diets or other nutritional supplementation.  Survey Procedures §482.28(a)(2)  
 
• Review the dietitian’s personnel file to determine that he/she is qualified based on education, experience, specialized training, and, if required by State law, is licensed, certified, or registered by the State.  
 
• If the dietitian is not full- time, determine that the number of hours spent working is 
appropriate to serve the nutritional needs of the patients, and that the hospital makes adequate provisions for a qualified consultant coverage when the dietitian is not  
available.

(Rev. 137, Issued: 04-01-15, Effective: 03-27-15, Implementation: 03-27-15)  §482.28(b) Menus must meet the needs of patients.  (1) - Individual patient nutritional needs must be met in accordance with recognized 
dietary practices.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.28(b)(1) 
 
Each hospital patient for whom the hospital is providing one or more meals or nutrition 
must have their nutritional needs met in a manner that is consistent with recognized dietary 
practices.  Affected patients include all inpatients and those patients in outpatient status, 
including the provision of observation services, whose stay is sufficiently long that they 
must be fed.  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food and 
Nutrition Center the nationally recognized source  for recommended dietary intakes 
allowances is the Institute of Medicine Food and Nutrition Board’s Dietary Reference 
Intakes (DRIs), which are designed to provide recommended nutrient intakes for use in a 
variety of settings. The DRIs are a set of four reference values:  
 
• Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is the average daily dietary intake 
of a nutrient that is sufficient to meet the requirement of nearly all (97 -98%) 
healthy persons. 
 
• Adequate Intake (AI) for a nutrient is similar to  the Estimated Safe and 
Adequate Daily Dietary Intakes (ESADDI) and is only established when an 
RDA cannot be determined. Therefore a nutrient either has an RDA or an 
AI. The AI is based on observed intakes of the nutrient by a group of healthy 
persons. 
 
• Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the highest daily intake of a nutrient 
that is likely to pose no risks of toxicity for almost all individuals. As intake 
above the UL increases, risk increases.  
 
• Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) is the amount of a nutrient that is 
estimated to meet the requirement of half of all healthy individuals in the 
population. 
 
USDA provides access to an interactive DRI tool and DRI tables at http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary- guidance/dietary -reference- intakes
  
 Meeting individual patient nutritional needs may include the use of therapeutic diets. Therapeutic diets refer to a diet ordered as part of the patient’s treatment for a disease or clinical condition, to eliminate, decrease, or increase certain substances in the diet (e.g., sodium or potassium), or to provide mechanically altered food when indicated.  Patients must be assessed for their risk for nutritional deficiencies or need for therapeutic diets and/or other nutritional supplementation.  Examples of patients who may have specialized dietary needs and may require a more detailed nutritional assessment include, but are not limited to:  
 
 All patients requiring artificial nutrition by any means (i.e., enteral nutrition (tube 
feeding), total parenteral nutrition, or peripheral parenteral nutrition);  
 
 Patients whose medical condition, surgical intervention, or physical status interferes 
with their ability to ingest, digest or absorb nutrients;  
 
 Patients whose diagnosis or presenting signs/symptoms indicates a compromised nutritional status (e.g., anorexia nervosa, bulimia, electrolyte imbalances, dysphagia, malabsorption, end stage organ diseases, etc.);  
 
 Patients whose medical condition can be adversely affected by their nutritional intake (e.g., diabetes, congestive heart failure, patients taking certain medications, renal diseases, etc.).  
 Patients who refuse the food served should be offered substitutes that are of equal nutritional value in order to meet their basic nutritional needs.  
 The care plan for patients identified as having specialized nutritional needs must address those needs as well as monitoring of their dietary intake and nutritional status.  The methods and frequency of monitoring could include one or more of the following, as well as other methods:  
 
• Patient weight (BMI, unintended weight loss or gain)  
• Intake and output  
• Lab values  
 
Survey Procedures §482.28(b)(1)  
 
• Can the dietician demonstrate how the menus  meet the nutritional needs of 
patients.  For example, does the service rely upon DRIs, including RDAs, in 
developing menus?  
 
• Can the dietician demonstrate patients are assessed for special nutritional needs 
and how the hospital assures the needs of those with specialized needs are met?  
 
• When observing care in inpatient units (or observation units where meals are 
provided) ask staff how patients are assessed for nutritional needs.    
o Ask them how they monitor patients identified as having specialized needs.  
 
o Is there evidence that therapeutic diets are provided as ordered?  
 Does the sample of patient records being reviewed include patients identified with special nutritional needs?  If not, ask to see records for several such patients.  Determine if there is evidence of monitoring the dietary intake and nutritional status of patients identified as having special nutritional needs.

(Rev. 137, Issued: 04- 01-15, Effective: 03 -27-15, Implementation: 03- 27-15) 
 
§482.28(b)(2) -  All patient diets, including therapeutic diets, must be ordered by a 
practitioner responsible for the care of the patient, or by a qualified dietitian or qualified nutrition professional as authorized by the medical staff and in accordance with State law governing dietitians and nutrition professionals.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.28(b)(2)  
 
Patient diets, including therapeutic diets, must be provided in accordance with orders from a 
practitioner responsible for the care of the patient, or by a qualified dietitian or qualified nutrition professional who is permitted to order diets under State law and authorized to do so by the medical staff.  
 Diets must be based on an assessment of the patient’s nutritional and therapeutic needs and documented in the patient’s medical record (including documentation about the patient’s tolerance to any therapeutic diet ordered).  
 The hospital’s governing body may choose, when permitted under State law and upon recommendation of the medical staff, to grant qualified dietitians or qualified nutrition professionals diet -ordering privileges.  In many cases State law determines what cri teria an 
individual must satisfy in order to be a “qualified dietician;” State law may define the term to mean a “registered dietician” registered with a private organization, such as the Commission on Dietetic Registration, or State law may impose differe nt or additional 
requirements.   Terms such as “nutritionists,” “nutrition professionals,” “certified clinical nutritionists,” and “certified nutrition specialists” are also used to refer to individuals who are not dieticians, but who may also be qualified under State law to order patient diets.  It is the responsibility of the hospital to ensure that individuals are qualified under State law before appointing them to the medical staff or granting them privileges to order diets.  
 If the hospital chooses not to grant diet -ordering privileges to dietitians or other nutrition 
professionals, even when permitted under State law, the patient’s diet must be prescribed by a practitioner responsible for the patient’s care.  In this situation, a dietitian or nutrition 
professional who does not have privileges to order diets may nevertheless assess a patient’s 
nutritional needs and provide recommendations or consultations for patients to a practitioner responsible for the care of the patient.   Survey Procedures §482.28(b)(2)  
 
• Review patient records to verify that diet orders are provided as prescribed by the practitioner(s) responsible for the care of the patient, a qualified dietitian, or qualified nutrition professional.  
• If diet orders are prescribed by a dietitian or other nutrition professional, review their records to verify that he or she was appointed to the medical staff with diet- ordering privileges, or was granted diet -ordering privileges 
without being appointed to the medical staff.  
 
o Ask the hospital how it determines whether the dietician/nutrition professional is qualified under state law.  Review staff records to verify that dieticians/nutrition professionals demonstrate the required qualifications.

§482.30  Condition  of Participation:  Utilization Review  
 
The hospital must have in effect a utilization review (UR) plan that provides for review of services furnished by the institution and by members of the medical staff to patients entitled to benefits under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.   
 Interpretive Guidelines  §482.30  
 
If the hospital does not satisfy one of the exception criteria at §482.30(a), it must have a UR 
plan in effect which provides for review of services provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.  
 Survey Procedures  §482.30   
The manner and degree of noncompliance with one or more of the UR standards is considered when determining whether there is condition- level compliance or non -
compliance.

§482.30(a) Standard:  Applicability  
 
The provisions of this section apply except in either of the following 
circumstances:  
 
(1) A Utilization and Quality Control Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) 
has assumed binding review for the hospital.  
 
(2) CMS has determined that the UR procedures established by the State under 
title XIX of the Act are superior to the procedures required in this section, and has required hospitals in that State to meet the UR plan requirements under §§456.50 through 456.245 of this chapter.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines  §482.30(a)  
 
The regulation permits two exceptions to the requirement for a hospital UR plan: (1) where 
the hospital has an agreement with a QIO under contract with the Secretary to assume 
binding review for the hospital or; (2) where CMS has determined that UR procedures 
established by the State under Medicaid are superior to the UR requirements for the Medicare program and  has required hospitals in that State to meet the UR requirements for 
the Medicaid program at 42 CFR 456.50 through 456.245. 
 According to the regulation at 42 CFR 476.86(e), QIO review and monitoring activities 
fulfill the requirements for compliance activities of State Survey Agencies under §1861(k) 
of the Social Security Act (Act).  The statutory requirements for utilization r eview at 
§1861(k) of the Act are reiterated in the UR CoP at 42 CFR 482.30.  Therefore, a hospital 
meets the exception requirements of 42 CFR 482.30 if a QIO has assumed binding review 
for the hospital.  (The hospital may not make requests for work to be performed by the QIO that goes beyond the scope of the QIO’s contract with the Secretary.) 
 
The regulation at 42 CFR 489.20(e) requires a hospital to maintain an agreement with a QIO to review the admissions, quality, appropriateness, and diagnostic information related 
to inpatient services for Medicare patients, if there is a QIO with a contract  with CMS in the 
area where the hospital is located.  
 CMS anticipates that most hospitals comply with the UR CoP by means of the QIO 
exception.  
With regard to the second exception, CMS would have to determine that UR procedures 
established by a State under Medicaid are superior to the UR requirements for Medicare.  Currently no UR plans established by a State under Medicaid have been approved as 
exceeding the requirements under Medicare and required for hospital compliance with the 
Medicare UR CoP within that State. In the event that CMS approves a State’s Medicaid UR process for compliance with the Medicare UR CoP, CMS will advise the affected State 
Survey Agency. 
 
Survey Procedures  §482.30(a) 
 
Surveyors are to verify either that the hospital:  
 
• Has its own UR plan in place and that it meets the regulatory requirements; or  
 
• If it does not have its own UR plan, that it has an agreement with the QIO that 
provides for binding UR review.  Surveyors should ask to see the signed, dated agreement.   If the hospital has an agreement with a QIO, it is not necessary for 
surveyors to assess the remaining UR standards. 
 
It is not necessary for SAs to conduct routine surveys for compliance with the provider 
agreement requirement to have a QIO agreement.  However, a hospital that does not satisfy 
the UR CoP through either its own program or a QIO agreement may be cited for violating the UR CoP at the condition level.

§82.30(b) Standard:  Composition of Utilization Review Committee  
 A UR committee consisting of two or more practitioners must carry out the UR function.  At least two of the members of the committee must be doctors of medicine or osteopathy.  The other members may be any of the other types of practitioners specified in § 482.12(c)(1). 
 
(1)  Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, the UR 
committee must be one of the following:  
 
 (i)  A staff committee of the institution; 
 
 (ii)  A group outside the institution-- 
 
 (A)  Established by the local medical society and some or all of  the 
hospitals in the locality; or  
  (B)  Established in a manner approved by CMS.  
 
(2)  If, because of the small size of the institution, it is impracticable to have a 
properly functioning staff committee, the UR committee must be established as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.  
 (3)  The committee or group’s reviews may not be conducted by any individual 
who-- 
 
 (i)  Has a direct financial interest (for example, an ownership interest) in that hospital; or  
  (ii)  Was professionally involved in the care of the patient whose case is being reviewed.  
 Survey Procedures  §482.30(b)  
 
• Determine the composition of the UR committee; 
 
• Determine that the governing body has delegated to the UR committee the authority and responsibility to carry out the UR function;  
 
• Verify that small hospitals delegate the UR function to an outside group if it is impractical to have a staff committee; 
• Ascertain that committee members are not financially involved in the hospital (ownership of 5 percent or greater) nor participants in the development or execution of the patient’s treatment plan.

§482.30(c) Standard:  Scope and Frequency of Review  
 (1)  The UR plan must provide for review for Medicare and Medicaid patients with respect to the medical necessity of -- 
 
(i)  Admissions to the institution;  (ii)  The duration of stays; and  
 (iii)  Professional services furnished including drugs and biologicals.  
 (2)  Review of admissions may be performed before, at, or after hospital admission.  
 (3)  Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, reviews may be conducted 
on a sample basis.  
 
(4)  Hospitals that are paid for inpatient hospital services under the prospective 
payment system set forth in Part 412 of this chapter must conduct review of duration of stays and review of professional services as follows:  
 
(i)  For duration of stays, these hospitals need review only cases that they reasonably assume to be outlier cases based on extended length of stay, as described in §412.80(a)(1)(i) of this chapter; and  
 (ii)  For professional services, these hospitals need review only cases that they reasonably assume to be outlier cases based on extraordinarily high costs, as 
described in §412.80(a)(1)(ii) of this chapter.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.30(c)  
 Admissions may be reviewed before, during, or after hospital admission as stated in the hospital’s UR plan.  Reviews may be conducted on a sample basis, except for reviews of extended stay cases.  
 In an Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) hospital, to determine outlier review compliance, “reasonably assumes” is a good faith test.  The question to ask is whether the hospital is reviewing outlier cases.  In instances where there was no other r eview of outlier 
cases, the question is whether it was reasonable for the hospital not to have known that the cases were in fact outliers.  Some medical judgment might be required to determine whether it is reasonable for the hospital to have assumed that a patient fell into a DRG other than the one eventually assigned by the intermediary.  This would be an issue in long stay outlier 
cases where the hospital did not review because the hospital erroneously assumed that the patient was in a DRG under which the case would not have been an outlier.  
 Survey Procedures  §482.30(c)  
 
• Examine the UR plan and other documentation to determine that the medical necessity for Medicare and Medicaid patients is reviewed with respect to admission, duration of the stay, and the professional services furnished. 
 
• Determine if the hospital is reimbursed under IPPS.  This requirement does not apply to IPPS excluded hospitals or units.  
 
• Verify that in an IPPS hospital the following are being reviewed:  
 
o Duration of stay in cases reasonably assumed to be outlier cases; and  
 
o Professional services in cases reasonably assumed to be outlier cases.

§482.30(d) Standard:  Determination Regarding Admissions or Continued 
Stays 
 
(1)   The determination that an admission or continued stay is not medically necessary - 
 
(i)    May be made by one member of the UR committee if the practitioner or practitioners responsible for the care of the patient, as specified of §482.12(c), 
concur with the determination or fail to present their views when afforded the 
opportunity; and  
 
(ii)   Must be made by at least two members of the UR committee in all other cases.  
 
(2)   Before making a determination that an admission or continued stay is not medically necessary, the UR committee must consult the practitioner or practitioners responsible for the care of the patient, as specified in §482.12(c), and afford the practiti oner or practitioners the opportunity to present their views.  
 (3)   If the committee decides that admission to or continued stay in the hospital is not medically necessary, written notification must be given, no later than 2 days after the determination, to the hospital, the patient, and the practitioner or practitio ners responsible for the care of the patient, as specified in §482.12(c);  
 Interpretive Guidelines  §482.30(d)  
 When other than a doctor of medicine or osteopathy makes an initial finding that the written criteria for extended stay are not met, the case must be referred to the committee, or subgroup thereof which contains at least one physician.  If the committee or  subgroup 
agrees after reviewing the case that admissions, or extended stay is not medically necessary or appropriate, the attending physician is notified and allowed an opportunity to present his views and any additional information relating to the patient’s needs for admissions or extended stay.  When a physician member of the committee performs the initial review instead of a non- physician reviewer, and he finds that admissions or extended stay is not 
necessary no referral to the committee or subgroup is  necessary and he may notify the 
attending practitioner directly.  
 If the attending practitioner does not respond or does not contest the findings of the committee or subgroup or those of the physician who performed the initial review, then the findings are final.  
 If the attending physician contests the committee or subgroup findings, or if he presents additional information relating to the patient’s need for extended stay, at least one additional physician member of the committee must review the case.  If the two p hysician 
members determine that the patient’s stay is not medically necessary or appropriate after considering all the evidence, their determination becomes final.  Written notification of this decision must be sent to the attending physician, patient (or next of kin), facility administrator, and the single State agency (in the case of Medicaid) no later than 2 days after such final decision and in no event later than 3 working days after the end of the assigned extended stay period.  There are only 5 working days in a given week.  Normally these days are Monday through Friday, however, the institution has the option to establish 5 other days as working days.  When a holiday falls on a working day, that day is not counted as a working day.  
 In no case may a non- physician make a final determination that a patient’s stay is not 
medically necessary or appropriate.  
 If, after referral of a questioned case to the committee or subgroup thereof, the physician 
reviewer determines that an admission or extended stay is justified, the attending physician 
shall be so notified and an appropriate date for subsequent extended st ay review will be 
selected and noted on the patient’s record.  
 Written notification of this final determination must be sent to the attending physician, the patient (or next of kin), the facility administrator and the single State agency (in the case of 
Medicaid) no later than 2 days after such final determination and in no event later than 3 
working days after the end of the assigned extended stay period. 
 
Where possible, the written notification should be received by all involved parties within the stated time period.  Where appropriate and desired, verbal notification may precede written notification.  
 Survey Procedures  §482.30(d)  
• Review a sample of “medically unnecessary” decisions involving admissions or continued stay that are not medically necessary and determine that these decisions are made by:  
 
o One member of the UR committee, if the practitioner(s) responsible for the patient’s care concurs with the determination or fails to present his/her views.  The practitioner must be one of those specified in §482.12(c)
, or 
 
o At least two members of the UR committee in all cases not qualified under the above.  
 
• Review a sample of “medically unnecessary” decisions and verify that the physician or practitioners, as specified in §482.12(c), were informed of the committees expected decision and were given an opportunity to comment. 
 
• Review a sample of “medically unnecessary” cases and verify that all involved parties are notified of the decision that care is medically not necessary no later than two days following the decision.

§482.30(e) Standard:  Extended Stay Review  
 (1)  In hospitals that are not paid under the prospective payment system, the UR committee must make a periodic review, as specified in the UR plan, or each current inpatient receiving hospital services during a continuous period of extended duration.   
 
The scheduling of the periodic reviews may -- 
 
(i)  Be the same for all cases; or  
 (ii)  Differ for different classes of cases.  
 
(2)  In hospitals paid under the prospective payment system, the UR committee must review all cases reasonably assumed by the hospital to be outlier cases because the extended length of stay exceeds the threshold criteria for the diagnosis, as described in §412.80(a)(1)(i).  The hospital is not required to review an extended stay that does not exceed the outlier threshold for the diagnosis.  (3)  The UR committee must make the periodic review no later than 7 days after the day required in the UR plan.  
 Survey Procedures  §482.30(e) 
 
• Review the facility’s definition of extended stay in the UR plan. 
 
• Verify that the hospital’s UR plan requires a periodic review of each current 
Medicare/Medicaid inpatient receiving hospital services of extended duration and that the review is carried out at the specified time stated in the facility’s UR plan.  
• The review may be the same for all cases or be different for different classes of care.  
 
• If the committee uses a different number of days for different diagnosis or functional categories for the period of extended stay, the surveyor must verify that there is a written list with lengths of stay designated for each diagnosis of functional catego ry. 
 
• Determine if the hospital is under IPPS.  Hospitals under IPPS need only review 
cases reasonably assumed to be outlier cases, and extended stay that exceeds the 
outlier threshold for the diagnosis. 
 
• Review minutes of the UR committee.  Determine that the periodic reviews of extended stay are carried out on or before the expiration of the stated period or no later than 7 days after the day required in the hospital’s plan.

§482.41(a) Standard:  Buildings  
 
The condition of the physical plant and the overall hospital environment must be developed and maintained in such a manner that the safety and well -being of patients 
are assured.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.41(a)  
 The hospital must ensure that the condition of the physical plant and overall hospital environment is developed and maintained in a manner to ensure the safety and well -being 
of patients.  This includes ensuring that routine and preventive maintenance and testing activities are performed as necessary, in accordance with Federal and State laws, regulations, and guidelines and manufacturer’s recommendations, by establishing maintenance schedules and conducting ongoing maintenance inspections to identify areas  
or equipment in need of repair.  The routine and preventive maintenance and testing activities should be incorporated into the hospital’s QAPI  plan. 
 The hospital must be constructed and maintained to ensure risks are minimized for patients as well as for employees and visitors.  Hospitals are expected to demonstrate how they are addressing important safety features in accordance with nationally recogni zed standards.  
Although the following items are expected to be addressed when applicable, the list is not all-inclusive. 
 Accessibility  
 
• The hospital must ensure all buildings at all locations of the certified hospital meet State and Federal accessibility standards (e.g. Office of Civil Rights requirements).  The requirements apply to the interior and exterior of all buildings.  
 
 
Age-related safety features  
 
• Hospitals are expected to address safety hazards and risks related to age- related 
factors.  Healthcare provided to neonatal, pediatric, and geriatric patients must be in accordance with nationally recognized standards.  Age -related risks may include 
items such as security of inpatient and outpatient locations, access to medications, cleaning supplies and other hazardous materials, furniture and other medical 
equipment, and increased chance of falls.   
 
Security  
 
• To minimize the risk of unauthorized access to or inappropriate departure from 
secured healthcare units, hospitals must demonstrate security features in accordance with nationally recognized standards to ensure the safety of vulnerable patients.  This includes, but is not limited  to, patients such as newborn (e.g. infant abduction), 
pediatric, behavioral health, those with diminished capacity and dementia/Alzheimer’s.
 
 
Access to non -clinical rooms identified as hazardous locations must be secured to 
prevent patient and visitor entry.  Examples include electrical rooms and heat, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) rooms. 
 
 Ligature risk  
 
• The presence of unmitigated ligature risks in a psychiatric hospital or psychiatric unit of a hospital is an immediate jeopardy situation.  Additionally, this also includes any location where patients at risk of suicide are identified. Ligature risk findings must be referred to the health and safety surveyors for further evaluation and possible citation under Patients’ Rights.
 
 
Weather -related exterior issues  
 
• Although hospitals cannot address all weather -related issues, they are expected to 
address potential safety hazards specific to weather on both the exterior and interior locations in accordance of nationally recognized standards.  Areas of risk include driveways, garages, entry points, walkways, etc.
 
 Life Safety Code surveyors assess the use of power strips in healthcare facilities.  However, the following guidance is provided as reference for healthcare surveyors as they survey physical environment along with other CoP requirements. Any observed power  strip 
deficiencies should be conveyed to the LSC surveyors for citation.  
 If line -operated medical equipment is used in a patient care room/area, inside the patient 
care vicinity:  
 
• UL power strips would have to be a permanent component of a rack- , table -, 
pedestal -, or cart -mounted & tested medical equipment assembly  
 
• Power strips providing power to medical equipment in a patient care room/area must be UL 1363A or UL 60601- 1 
 
• Power strips cannot be used for non- medical equipment 
 If line -operated medical equipment is used in a patient care room/area, outside the patient 
care vicinity:  
 
• UL power strips could be used for medical & non- medical equipment with 
precautions as described in the memo  
 
• Power strips providing power to medical equipment in a patient care room/area must be UL 1363A or UL 60601- 1 
 
• Power strips providing power to non- medical equipment in a patient care room/area 
must be UL 1363 
 
If line -operated medical equipment is not used in a patient care room/area, inside and 
outside the patient care vicinity:  
 
• UL power strips could be used with precautions  
 
Power strips providing power to non- medical equipment in a patient care room/area must be 
UL 1363.  In non- patient care areas/rooms, other UL strips could be used with the general 
precautions.  
  Survey Procedures §482.41(a)  
 
• Verify that the condition of the hospital is maintained in a manner to assure the 
safety and well -being of patients (e.g., condition of ceilings, walls, and floors, 
presence of patient hazards, etc.).  
 
• Review the hospital’s routine and preventive maintenance schedules to determine 
that ongoing maintenance inspections are performed and that necessary repairs are completed.  
 
• Review a copy of the most recent environmental risk assessment to determine if the 
hospital has identified any accessibility, age -related, security, suicide and/or weather 
related risks or concerns.  If environmental safety concerns have been identified in 
this assessment, what plans have been implemented by the hospital to ensure patient/staff safety?  
 
• Refer any potential power strip use deficiencies to Life Safety Code surveyors.  
 
Communicate findings with health and safety surveyors as appropriate.

 Interpretive Guidelines  §482.41(a)(2)  
 
The hospital must have a system to provide emergency gas and water as needed to provide 
care to inpatients and other persons who may come to the hospital in need of care.  This includes making arrangements with local utility companies and others for the pr ovision of 
emergency sources of water and gas.  The hospital should consider nationally accepted references or calculations made by qualified staff when determining the need for at least water and gas.  For example, one source for information on water is t he Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA).  
 Emergency gas includes fuels such as propane, natural gas, fuel oil, liquefied natural gas, as well as any gases the hospital uses in the care of patients such as oxygen, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, etc.  
 The hospital should have a plan to protect these limited emergency supplies, and have a plan for prioritizing their use until adequate supplies are available.  The plan should also address the event of a disruption in supply (e.g., disruption to the entire  surrounding 
community).  Survey Procedures  §482.41(a)(2)  
 
• Review the system used by hospital staff to determine the hospital’s emergency needs for gas and water.  Verify that the system accounts for not only inpatients, but also staff and other persons who come to the hospital in need of care during emergencies.  
 
• Determine the source of emergency gas and water, both the quantity of these 
supplies readily available at the hospital, and that are needed within a short time 
through additional deliveries. 
 
• Verify that arrangements have been made with utility companies and others for the 
provision of emergency sources of critical utilities, such as water and gas.

 (1) The hospital must provide a discharge planning evaluation to the patients 
identified in paragraph (a) of this section, and to other patients upon the patient’s request, the request of a person acting on the patient’s behalf, or the request of the physician.  
 
(3) - The discharge planning evaluation must include an evaluation of the likelihood of 
a patient needing post -hospital services and of the availability of the services.  
 (4) - The discharge planning evaluation must include an evaluation of the likelihood of 
a patient’s capacity for self -care or of the possibility of the patient being cared for in 
the environment from which he or she entered the hospital.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.43(b)(1), §482.43(b)(3) & §482.43(b)(4)  
 For every inpatient identified under the process required at §482.43(a) as at potential risk of adverse health consequences without a discharge plan, a discharge planning evaluation must be completed by the hospital.  In addition, an evaluation must also be completed if the 
patient, or the patient’s representative, or the patient’s attending physician requests one.  Unless the hospital has adopted a voluntary policy of developing an evaluation for every inpatient, the hospital must also have a process for making patients, including the patient’s representative, and attending physicians aware that they may request a discharge planning 
evaluation, and that the hospital will perform an evaluation upon request.  Hospitals must perform the evaluation upon request, regardless of whether the patient meets the hospital’s screening criteria for an evaluation.  
 In contrast to the screening process , the evaluation entails a more detailed review of the 
individual patient’s post -discharge needs, in order to identify the specific areas that must be 
addressed in the discharge plan.  
 §482.43(b)(4)  requires that the evaluation include assessment of the patient’s capacity for 
self-care or, alternatively, to be cared for by others in the environment, i.e., the setting, from 
which the patient was admitted to the hospital.   In general, the goal upon di scharge is for a 
patient to be able to return to the setting in which they were living prior to admission.  This may be the patient’s home in the community or residence in a nursing home.  In the case of transfer from another hospital, general ly the preferred goal is to return the patient to the 
setting from which he/she presented to the transferring hospital.  The evaluation must consider what the patient’s care needs will be immediately upon discharge, and whether those needs are expected to remain constant or lessen over time.  If the patient was admitted from his/her private residence, the evaluation must inc lude an 
assessment of whether the patient is capable of addressing his/her care needs through self -
care.  The evaluation must include assessment of whether the patient will require 
specialized medical equipment or permanent physical modifications to the home, and the 
feasibility of acquiring the equipment or the modifications being made.  If the patient is not 
able to provide some or all of the required self -care, the evaluation must  also address 
whether the patient has family or friends available who are willing and able to provide the required care at the times it will be needed, or who could, if willing, be trained by the hospital sufficiently to provide the required care.   
 §482.43(b)(3) requires the evaluation to consider the patient’s likelihood of needing post -
hospital services and the availability of such services.  
 If neither the patient nor the patient’s family or informal caregiver(s) are able to address all of the required care needs, then the evaluation must determine whether there are community -based services that are available to meet the patient’s needs while allowing the 
patient to continue living at home.    Such health care services include, but are not limited to:  
 
• Home health, attendant care, and other community- based services;  
• Hospice or palliative care;  
• Respiratory therapy;  
• Rehabilitation services (PT, OT, Speech, etc.);  
• End Stage Renal Dialysis services;  
• Pharmaceuticals and related supplies;  
• Nutritional consultation/supplemental diets; and/or  
• Medical equipment and related supplies.  
 However, services may also include those that are not traditional health care services, but which may be essential to a patient’s ongoing ability to live in the community, including, but not limited to:  
 
• Home and physical environment modifications;  
• Transportation services;  
• Meal services; and/or  
• Household services, such as housekeeping, shopping, etc.  
 Some of the information related to needed services will emerge from the required evaluation of the patient’s ability to receive care in the home, either as self -care or provided 
by someone else.  All patients, even those with a high capability for self -care, are likely to 
require some follow -up ambulatory health care services, e.g., a post -discharge appointment 
with their surgeon, specialist or primary care physician, or a series of appointments for physical or occupational therapy.  Some patients might have more complex care needs which nevertheless may still be met in the home setting, depending on the specific clinical needs and the services available in the patient’s community.   
 For example, some patients require wound care that exceeds the capabilities of their family or others who act as informal caregivers.  But they may be able to receive sufficient care in the home setting through a home health service, if such services are a vailable.  Some 
patients with chronic conditions may prefer to remain in their home and would be able to do so using available community- based services, but also require financial supports, such as 
Medicaid -financed home and community- based waiver services .  If such supports are not 
immediately available at the time of discharge while an application for waiver services is pending, the evaluation should consider the availability of other short term supports that would allow the patient to be discharged home.  
If the result of the evaluation is that the patient cannot receive required care if he/she returns to home, then an assessment must be made of options for transfer to another inpatient or residential health care facility that can address the patient’s need s, including 
other types of hospitals, such as rehabilitation hospitals; skilled nursing facilities; assisted 
living facilities; nursing homes; or inpatient hospice facilities.  
 
If prior to the hospital admission the patient was a resident in a facility that he or she wishes to return to, such as an assisted living or nursing facility or skilled nursing facility, the evaluation must address whether that facility has the capability  to provide the post-hospital 
care required by the patient.  The post- discharge care requirements may be different than 
the care that was previously provided.  This requires dialogue and cooperation between hospitals and post- hospital care facilities in th e area served by the hospital, as well as with 
the physicians who provide care to patients in either or both of these settings.    Long term care facilities often express concern that hospitals discharge patients to their facilities with care needs that exceed their care capabilities, necessitating sending the patient to the emergency department for care and possible readmission.  On the other hand, hospitals often express concern that long term care facilities send patients to the emergency department with ambulatory care-sensitive conditions, i.e., conditions that either do not require an acute level of care, or which could have been  prevented from escalating to an 
acute level had appropriate primary care been provided in a timely manner.  
 While hospitals cannot address these concerns in isolation, they are expected to be knowledgeable about the care capabilities of area long term care facilities and to factor this knowledge into the discharge planning evaluation.    Hospitals are expected to have knowledge of the capabilities and capacities of not only of long term care facilities, but also of the various types of service providers in the area where most of the patients it serves receive post-hospital care, in order to develop a discharge plan that not only meets the patient’s needs in theory, but also can be implemented.  This includes knowledge of community services, as well as familiarity with available Medicaid home and community- based services (HCBS), since the State’s Medicaid program plays a 
major role in supporting post-hospital care for many patients.  If the hospital is one with specialized services that attract a significant number of patients who will receive their post-hospital care in distant communities, the hospital is expected to take reasonable steps to identify the services that will be availab le to the patient.  
 Once the determination has been made that services will be necessary post -discharge, the 
team must then determine availability of those services or identify comparable substitutions.  Included in the evaluation is coordination with insurers and other payors, including the State Medicaid agency, as necessary to ensure resources prescribed are approved and available.

Although not required under the regulations, hospitals would be well advised to develop 
collaborative partnerships with post-hospital care providers to improve care transitions of 
care that might support better patient outcomes.  This includes not only skilled nursing 
facilities and nursing facilities, but also providers of community- based services.  For 
example, Centers for Independent Living (CIL) and Aging and Disability Resource 
Centers (ADRC) are resources for community -based services and housing avail able to 
persons with disabilities and older adults.  Hospitals can find local CIL’s at 
http://www.ilru.org/html/publications/directory/index.html  and ADRC’s and other 
resources at http://www.adrc -tae.org/tiki-index.php?page=HomePage . 
 
 The ability to pay out of pocket for services must also be discussed with the family or other support persons.  Although hospitals are not expected to have definitive knowledge of the terms of any given patient’s insurance coverage or eligibility for community -based services, 
or for Medicaid coverage, they are expected to have a general awareness of these matters 
and their impact on the patient’s post-discharge needs and prospects for recovery.  For 
example, if the patient is a Medicare beneficiary, the hospital is expected to be aware of Medicare coverage requirements for home health care or admission to a rehabilitation hospital, a skilled nursing facility, or a long term care hospital, etc. and to make the beneficiary aware that they may have to pay out of pocket for services not meeting the coverage requirements.  
 Similarly, for Medicaid, they should know coverage options for home health, attendant care, and long term care services or have contacts at the State Medicaid agency that can assist with these issues.  As noted above, hospitals are also expected to have knowledge of community resources to assist in arranging services. Some examples include Aging and Disability Resource Centers and Centers for Independent Living (see box above).

Providing a discharge planning tool to patients and their family or other support persons 
may help to reinforce the discharge plan.  Use of the tools may encourage patients’ 
participation in developing the plan as well as provide them an easy- to-follow guide to 
prepare them for a successful transition from the hospital.  The tool should be given to 
patients on admission, reviewed throughout their stay, and updated prior to discharge.   
 
Examples of available tools include:   
 
• Medicare’s “Your Discharge Planning Checklist,” (available at 
http://www.medicare.gov/publications/pubs/pdf/11376.pdf )  
 
• Agency for Healthcare, Research and Quality’s (AHRQ) “Taking Care of Myself:

The hospital CoP governing patients’ rights at §482.13(b) provides that “The patient has the 
right to participate in the development and implementation of his or her plan of care.”  (CMS views discharge planning as part of the patient’s plan of care). “The patient or his/her representative (as allowed under State law) has the right to make informed decisions regarding his/her care” and “The patient’s rights include...being involved in care planning and treatment.”  Accordingly, hospitals are expected to engage the patient, or the patient’s representative, actively in the development of the discharge evaluation, not only as a source of information required for the assessment of self- care capabilities, but also to incorporate 
the patient’s goals and preferences as much as possible into the evaluation.  A patient’s goals and preferences may be, in the hospital’s view, unrealistic.  Identifying divergent hospital and patient assessments of what is realistic enables a discussion of these differences and may result  in an assessment and subsequent development of a discharge 
plan that has a better chance of successful implementation.

Survey Procedures §482.43(b)(1), §482.43(b)(3) & §482.43(b)(4)  
 
• In every unit with inpatient beds surveyed, is there evidence of discharge planning 
evaluation activities?  
 
• Are staff members who are responsible for discharge planning evaluation correctly following the hospital’s policies and procedures?  
 
• If the hospital does not require a discharge planning evaluation for all inpatients:  
 
• Does the hospital have a standard process for notifying patients, their representative, 
and physicians that they may request a discharge planning evaluation and that the 
hospital will conduct an evaluation upon request?  
 
• Can discharge planning and unit nursing staff describe the process for a patient or the patient’s representative to request a discharge planning evaluation?  
 
• Interview patients and their representatives.  If they say they were not aware they could request a discharge planning evaluation, can the hospital provide evidence they received notice of their right?  
 
• Interview attending physicians to see if they are aware they can request a discharge planning evaluation.  If they are not aware, can the hospital provide evidence of how they inform the medical staff about this?   
 
• Review a sample of cases to determine if the discharge planning evaluation documents 
the patient’s (or the patient’s representatives) goals and preferences for post -discharge 
placement and care.  
 
• Review a sample of cases to determine if the discharge planning evaluation includes an assessment of:  
 
• The patient’s post -discharge care needs being met in the environment from which 
he/she entered the hospital? What the patient’s care needs will be immediately upon discharge, and whether those needs are expected to remain constant or lessen over time?  
 
• The patient’s insurance coverage (if applicable) and how that coverage might or 
might not provide for necessary services post -hospitalization?  
 
• For patients admitted from home --   
 
• Whether the patient can perform activities of daily living (personal 
hygiene and grooming, dressing and undressing, feeding, voluntary 
control over bowel and bladder, ambulation, etc.)?  
 
• The patient’s or family/other support person’s ability to provide self -
care/care?  
 
• Whether the patient will require specialized medical equipment or 
home modification?  
 
• If yes, did the evaluation include an assessment of whether the equipment is available or if the modifications can be made to safely discharge the patient to that setting?  
 
• If the patient or family/support person is unable to meet care needs or 
there are additional care needs above their capabilities, did the 
evaluation include an assessment of available community- based 
services to meet post -hospital needs?  
 
• For patients admitted from a nursing facility, skilled nursing facility or assisted living facility did the evaluation assess whether the prior facility has the capability to provide necessary post -hospital services to the patient (i.e. is the 
same, higher , or lower level of care required and can those needs be met?)If yes, 
is there any documentation that the patient’s care needs fall within the capabilities of the facility?  
 
• Are the results of the discharge planning evaluation documented in the medical record?

§482.43(b)(5) -  The hospital personnel must complete the evaluation on a timely basis 
so that appropriate arrangements for post -hospital care are made before discharge, 
and to avoid unnecessary delays in discharge. 
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.43(b)(5)  
 After a patient has been identified as needing an evaluation, or after a request for an evaluation has been made by the physician, patient and/or patient’s representative, the evaluation must be completed timely.  This means there must be sufficient time a fter 
completion to allow arrangements for post -hospital care to be made, without having to 
delay the patient’s discharge in order to do so, or requiring the patient to transfer to a different setting from where he/she was admitted from primarily due to the  delay in making 
appropriate arrangements.  The comparatively short average length of stay of a short term acute care hospital inpatient necessitates prompt attention to patients’ discharge planning needs in that type of hospital.  Failure to complete the evaluation in a timely manner could make it more difficult to implement the patient’s final discharge plan, and/or may cause an unnecessary delay in the patient’s discharge from the hospital.  While other types of hospitals with a longer average length of stay may be able to complete the evaluation at a later point after admission, they too must complete it on a timely basis to avoid delays in discharge.  
 Where a team approach is utilized by the hospital in developing the discharge planning evaluation, there must be a process to promote efficient collaboration among team members 
to complete the evaluation in a timely manner.  Changes in patient condition throughout the hospitalization warrant adjustments to the discharge plan.   
 Survey Procedures §482.43(b)(5)  
 
• Review a sample of cases to determine if the discharge planning evaluation was 
completed on a timely basis to allow for appropriate arrangements to be made for post -
hospital care and to avoid delays in discharge.  In order to assess this:  
 
• Determine when the discharge planning evaluation was initiated.  If the evaluation was not begun within 24 hours of the request or identification of the need for an evaluation, ask why.  
 
• Is there a pattern of delayed start or completion of the evaluation?  If so, is the delay due to circumstances beyond the hospital’s control (e.g., inability to reach the beneficiary’s support person(s), continuing changes in the patient’s condition) and/or is the delay due to the hospital’s failure to develop timely discharge planning evaluations?

 §482.43(b)(6) -  The hospital … must discuss the results of the evaluation with the 
patient or individual acting on his or her behalf.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.43(b)(6)  
 
The results of the discharge planning evaluation must be discussed with the patient or the 
patient’s representative.  Documentation of this communication must be included in the 
medical record, including if the patient rejects the results of the evaluation.  It is not 
necessary for the hospital to obtain a signature from the patient (or the patient’s 
representative, as applicable) documenting the discussion. 
 The patient or the patient’s representative must be actively engaged in the development of the plan, so that the discussion of the evaluation results represents a continuation of this active engagement.  It would not be appropriate for a hospital to conduc t an evaluation 
without the participation of the patient or the patient’s representative, and then present the results of the evaluation to the patient as a finished product, since this would place the patient in a passive position that is not consistent w ith the requirements of the patients’ 
rights CoP at §482.13(b).  Survey Procedures §482.43(b)(6)

 §482.43(b)(6) – [The hospital must] include the discharge planning evaluation in the patient’s medical record for use in establishing an appropriate discharge plan….  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.43(b)(6)  
 The hospital must include the discharge planning evaluation in the patient’s medical record in order for it to guide the development of the patient’s discharge plan.  Timely placement of the evaluation in the medical record facilitates communication among members of the patient’s healthcare team who should participate in a multidisciplinary process to develop and implement the discharge plan.  The evaluation and subsequent planning process may be a continuous one and hospitals may choose not to divide the process into distinct documents.  The key requirement is that the evaluation results are included in the patient’s medical record and are used in the development of the features of the discharge plan.

 §482.43(c) Standard:  Discharge Plan  (1) - A registered nurse, social worker, or other appropriately qualified personnel must develop, or supervise the development of, a discharge plan if the discharge planning evaluation indicates a need for a discharge plan.  Interpretive Guidelines §482.43(c)(1)  
 The discharge plan that is based on the findings of the discharge planning evaluation must be developed by a registered nurse, social worker, or other appropriate qualified personnel, or by a person who is supervised by such personnel.  State law governs t he qualifications 
required to be considered a registered nurse or a social worker.  The hospital’s written discharge planning policies and procedures must specify the qualifications for personnel other than registered nurses or social workers who develop or supervise the development of the plan.  The qualifications should include such factors as previous experience in discharge planning, knowledge of clinical and social factors that affect the patient’s functional status at discharge, knowledge of community resources to meet post- discharge clinical  and social 
needs, and assessment skills.  All personnel performing or supervising development of discharge plans, including registered nurses and social workers, must have knowledge of clinical, social, insurance/financial and physical factors that must b e considered when 
evaluating how a patient’s expected post- discharge care needs can be met.

A well designed discharge planning process uses a multidisciplinary team approach.  
Team members may include representatives from nursing, case management, social 
work, medical staff, pharmacy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, respiratory 
therapy, dietary, and other healthcare professionals involved with the patient’s care.  The 
team approach helps to ensure all of the patient’s post- discharge care needs are addressed 
in the plan, increasing the likelihood of successful recovery and avoidance of 
comp lications and readmissions. 
 The hospital CoP governing patients’ rights at §482.13(b) provides that “The patient has the right to participate in the development and implementation of his or her plan of care.”  (CMS views discharge planning as part of the patient’s plan of care). “The patient or his/her representative (as allowed under State law) has the right to make informed decisions 
regarding his/her care” and “The patient’s rights include...being involved in care planning 
and treatment.”  Accordingly, hospitals are expected to engage the patient, or the patient’s 
representative, actively in the development of the discharge plan, not only to provide them the necessary education and training to provide self-care/care, but also to incorporate the patient’s goals and preferences as much as possible into the plan. A patient will be more likely to cooperate in the implementation of a discha rge plan that reflects his/her 
preferences, increasing the likelihood of a successful care transition and better health outcomes. 
 A patient’s goals and preferences may be, in the hospital’s view, unrealistic.  A hospital is not obligated to develop a discharge plan that cannot be implemented.   However, the fact that a plan incorporating the patient’s goals and preferences might be m ore time -consuming 
for the hospital to develop and implement than another alternative does not make the patient’s preferred plan unrealistic.

If a patient exercises the right to refuse to participate in discharge planning or to 
implement a discharge plan, documentation of the refusal in the medical record is 
recommended.  
 
 Survey Procedures §482.43(c)(1)  
• Review a sample of cases to determine if the discharge plan was developed by an RN, 
Social Worker, or other qualified personnel, as defined in the hospital discharge planning policies and procedures, or someone they supervise? In order to assess this: 
 
• Review the hospital’s written policy and procedure governing who is responsible for developing or supervising the development of the discharge plan.  Does the policy permit someone other than a RN or social worker to be responsible for developing or supervising development of such plans?  If yes, does the policy specify the qualifications of the personnel other than a RN or social worker to perform this function?   
 
• Determine which individual(s) are responsible for developing or supervising the 
development of discharge plans.  Review their personnel folders to determine if they are a RN, social worker, or meet the hospital’s criteria for developing/supervising the discharge plan.  If they are not, are they supervised by an individual who is an RN, social worker or qualified according to the hospital’s policies?  Are their discharge plans reviewed by their supervisor before being finalized? 
 
• Ask  personnel who supervise or develop discharge plans to give examples illustrating their knowledge of healthcare and other resources available in the community that could be utilized to meet patients’  expected post- discharge care 
needs.  
 
• Ask the discharge planner how the patient or patient’s representative is engaged to participate in the development of the discharge plan.  Does the discharge plan identify the patient’s or patient’s representative discharge preferences?  
 
• Does the discharge plan match the identified needs as determined by the discharge 
planning evaluation?

§482.43(c)(2) In the absence of a finding by the hospital that a patient needs a discharge plan, the patient’s physician may request a discharge plan.  In such a case, the hospital must develop a discharge plan for the patient.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.43(c)(2)  
 If a patient is not identified through the hospital’s discharge planning evaluation process as requiring a discharge plan, the patient’s physician may nevertheless request a discharge plan.  The hospital must develop a discharge plan when requested to do s o by the patient’s 
physician.  If the hospital’s policies and procedures call for a discharge plan for every hospital inpatient, then it is not necessary to include a separate provision in those policies requiring development of a plan upon physician request, since such a provision woul d be superfluous.  
 Survey Procedures §482.43(c)(2)  
 
• Review the hospital’s discharge planning policies and procedures to determine whether 
it requires the development of a discharge plan for all inpatients, or only for those identified as needing a plan through a risk- based identification and evaluation proc ess.   
 
• If the hospital does not require a discharge planning evaluation for all inpatients:  
 
• Does the hospital have a standard process for notifying physicians that they may 
request a discharge plan evaluation and that the hospital will develop a plan upon 
request?  
 
• Interview attending physicians to see if they are aware they can request a discharge plan.  If they are not aware they can request a discharge plan, can the hospital provide evidence of how they inform the medical staff about this?

 §482.43(c)(3) -  The hospital must arrange for the initial implementation of the 
patient’s discharge plan….  §482.43(c)(5) -  As needed, the patient and family members or interested persons must 
be counseled to prepare them for post -hospital care.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.43(c)(3) & §482.43(c)(5)  
 The hospital is required to arrange for the initial implementation of the discharge plan.  This includes providing in- hospital education/training to the patient for self -care or to the 
patient’s family or other support person(s) who will be providing care in the patient’s home.  It also includes arranging:  
 
• Transfers to rehabilitation hospitals, long term care hospitals, or long term care facilities;  
 
• Referrals to home health or hospice agencies;  
 
• Referral for follow -up with physicians/practitioners, occupational or physical 
therapists, etc.;  
 
• Referral to medical equipment suppliers; and  
 • Referrals to pertinent community resources that may be able to assist with financial, 
transportation, meal preparation, or other post -discharge needs.  
 
(See §482.43(d) for more discussion about the hospital’s transfer or referral obligations and the initial implementation of the plan relating to transfer/referral.)   
 The discharge planning process is a collaborative one that must include the participation of 
the patient and the patient’s informal caregiver or representative, when applicable.  In 
addition, other family or support persons who will be providing care to the patient after 
discharge need to be engaged in the process.   Keeping the patient, and, when applicable, the patient’s representative and other support persons informed throughout the development of the plan is essential for its success.  Providing them w ith information on post -discharge 
options, what to expect after discharge and, as applicable, instruction and training in how to 
provide care is essential.  The patient needs clear instructions regarding what to do when 
concerns, issues, or problems arise, including who to call and when they should seek emergency assistance.   Although it may be an important component of the discharge instructions, it is not acceptable to only advise a patient to “return to the ED” whenever problems arise.   
 There are a variety of tools and techniques that have focused on improving the support 
provided to patients who are discharged back to their homes.  A comprehensive approach employing combinations of these techniques has been found to improve patient outcomes and reduce hospital readmission rates, including, but not limited to:  
 
• Improved education) to patients and support persons regarding disease processes, 
medications, treatments, diet and nutrition, expected symptoms, and when and how to seek additional help.  Teaching methods must be based on recognized methodologies.  CMS doe s not prescribe any specific methodologies, but examples 
include the teach -back, repeat -back approach and simulation laboratories;  
 
• Written discharge instructions, in the form of checklists when possible, that are 
legible, in plain language, culturally sensitive and age appropriate;  
 
• Providing supplies, such as materials for changing dressings on wounds, needed 
immediately post- discharge; and  
 
• A list of all medications the patient should be taking after discharge, with clear 
indication of changes from the patient’s pre -admission medications; 
 
The education and training provided to the patient or the patient’s caregiver(s) by the 
hospital must be tailored to the patient’s identified needs related to medications, treatment modalities, physical and occupational therapies, psychosocial needs, appoi ntments, and 
other follow -up activities, etc.  Repeated review of instructions with return demonstrations 
and/or repeat -backs by the patient, and their support persons will improve their ability to 
deliver care properly.  This includes providing instructions in writing as well as verbally reinforcing the education and training.    It is also necessary to provide information to patients and their support persons when the patient is being transferred to a rehabilitation or a long term care hospital, or to a long term care setting, such as a skilled nursing facility or nursing facility.  The information should address questions such as:  the goal of treatment in the next setting and prospects for the 
patient’s eventual discharge home.  
 
The hospital must document in the patient’s medical record the arrangements made for initial implementation of the discharge plan, including training and materials provided to the patient or patient’s informal caregiver or representative, as applicable.

Additional actions hospitals might consider taking to improve the patient’s post-
discharge care transition:  
 
• Scheduling follow-up appointments with the patient’s primary care 
physician/practitioner and in-home providers of service as applicable; 
 
• Filling prescriptions prior to discharge; 
 
• If applicable, arranging remote monitoring technologies, e.g., pulse oximetry and 
daily weights for congestive heart failure (CHF) patients; pulse and blood 
pressure monitoring for cardiac patients; and blood glucose levels for diabetic 
patients; and  
 
• Follow-up phone calls within 24 -72 hours by the hospital to the patient after 
discharge.   
 
The communication with the patient to ensure implementation of the discharge plan does 
not stop at discharge.  An initiative showing significant success in reducing preventable 
readmissions involves the hospital contacting the patient by phone in the first 24 to 72 
hours after discharge.  The phone contact provides an opportunity for the patient to pose 
questions and for the hospital to address any confusion related to medications, diet, 
activity, etc., and to reinforce the education/instruction that took place in the hospital 
prior to discharge.  This also helps to reduce patient and family member anxieties as they 
manage post-hospital care needs.  
 
 Hospital staff placing the calls should be familiar with the patient’s discharge plan and 
qualified to address typical questions that might be expected.  They should also be 
knowledgeable about when to instruct the patient to seek a more immediate evaluation, 
including where to go for such evaluation.  Although this follow-up phone call can serve 
as a customer service initiative for the hospital, the primary intent would be to provide an 
opportunity for questions and to reduce or eliminate any confusion or concerns regarding 
post- hospital care.  
 
  Survey Procedures §482.43(c)(3) & §482.43(c)(5)  
• Review cases of discharged patients  to determine if the hospital arranges initial 
implementation of the discharge plan by providing: 
 
• For patients discharged to home: 
 
• In-hospital training to patient and family/support persons, using recognized 
methods; 
 
• Written discharge instructions that are legible and use non-technical language; 
 
• A legible, complete, reconciled medication list that highlights changes from the post 
hospital regimen;  
• Referrals as applicable to specialized ambulatory services, e.g. physical therapy, 
occupational therapy, home health, hospice, mental health, etc.;  
 
• Referrals as applicable to community -based resources other than health services, 
e.g. Departments of Aging, elder services, transportation services, Centers for Independent Living, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, etc.;  
 
• Arranging essential durable medical equipment, e.g. oxygen, wheel chair, hospital bed, commode, etc.;  
 
• Sending necessary medical information to providers that the patient was referred to prior to the first post -discharge appointment or within 7 days of discharge, 
whichever comes first; and  
 
• For patients transferred to another inpatient facility, was necessary medical information ready at time of transfer and sent to the receiving facility with the patient?  
 
• Were there portions of the plan the hospital failed to begin implementing, resulting in delays in discharge?

 §482.43(c)(4) -  The hospital must reassess the patient’s discharge plan if there are 
factors that may affect continuing care needs or the appropriateness of the discharge plan.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.43(c)(4)  
 Changes in a patient’s condition may warrant adjustments to the discharge plan.  Hospitals must have in place either a routine reassessment of all plans or a process for triggering a reassessment of the patient’s post -discharge needs, capabilities and discharge plan when 
significant changes in the patient’s condition or available supports occur.  
 Survey Procedures §482.43(c)(4)  
 
• Review a sample of cases to determine if any significant changes in the patient’s 
condition were noted in the medical record that changed post -discharge needs, and if the 
discharge plan was updated accordingly.  
• In making this determination, ask staff responsible for discharge planning when and how they reassess a patient’s discharge plan.   If none of the records being used for the tracers suggest a need to revise the discharge plan, ask staff to present one or m ore 
clinical records that document reassessment.

that are available to the patient, that are participating in the Medicare program, and that serve the geographic area (as defined by the HHA) in which the patient resides, or in the case of a SNF, in the geographic area requested by the patient.  HHAs must request to be listed by the hospital as available.  
 
(i) - This list must only be presented to patients for whom home health care or post -
hospital extended care services are indicated and appropriate as determined by the 
discharge planning evaluation. 
 (ii) - For patients enrolled in managed care organizations, the hospital must indicate the availability of home health and post- hospital extended care services through 
individuals and entities that have a contract with the managed care organizations. (iii) The hospital must document in the patient's medical record that the list was presented to the patient or to the individual acting on the patient's behalf.  
 §482.43(c)(7) The hospital, as part of the discharge planning process, must inform the patient or the patient's family of their freedom to choose among participating Medicare providers of post -hospital care services and must, when possible, respect 
patient  and family preferences when they are expressed.  The hospital must not 
specify or otherwise limit the qualified providers that are available to the patient.  
 §482.43(c)(8) The discharge plan must identify any HHA or SNF to which the patient is referred in which the hospital has a disclosable financial interest, as specified by the Secretary, and any HHA or SNF that has a disclosable financial interest in a hospital under Medicare. Financial interests that are disclosable under Medicare are determined in accordance with the provisions of Part 4 20, Subpart C, of this chapter.  
 Interpretative Guidelines §482.43(c)(6),  §482.43(c)(7) & §482.43(c)(8)  The hospital must include a list of Medicare -participating home health agencies (HHAs) 
and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in the discharge plan for those patients for whom the plan indicates home health or post- hospital extended care services are requir ed.  
 
• “Extended care services” are defined at sections 1861(h) and (i) of the Social Security Act as items or services furnished in a skilled nursing facility (SNF). SNFs included on the list must be located in a geographic area that the patient or patient’s representative indicated he/she prefers.   
 
• For Home Health Agencies (HHAs) the list must consist of Medicare -participating 
HHAs that have requested the hospital to be listed and which serve the geographic area where the patient lives.  Hospitals may expect the HHA to define its geographic service area when it submits its request to be listed.    
 During the discharge planning process the hospital must inform the patient of his/her freedom to choose among Medicare-participating post-hospital providers and must not direct the patient to specific provider(s) or otherwise limit which qualified provider s the 
patient may choose among.  Hospitals have the flexibility either to develop their own lists or to print a list of skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies in the applicable geographic areas from the CMS websites, Nursing Home Compare (www.medicare.gov/NHcompare
) and Home Health Compare 
(www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare ).  If hospitals develop their own lists, they are 
expected to update them at least annually.  (69 FR 49226, August 11, 2004)

Hospitals may also refer patients and their families to the Nursing Home Compare and 
Home Health Compare websites for additional information regarding Medicare- certified 
skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies, as well as Medicaid -participating  
nursing facilities.    
 
The data on the Nursing Home Compare website include an overall performance rating, 
nursing home characteristics, performance on quality measures, inspection results, and 
nursing staff information.   
 
Home Health Compare provides details about every Medicare- certified home health 
agency in the country. Included on the website are quality indicators such as managing 
daily activities, managing pain and treating symptoms, treating wounds and preventing 
pressure sores, preventing harm, and preventing unplanned hospital care.   
 
The hospital might also refer the patient and their representatives to individual State 
agency websites, Long-Term Care Ombudsmen Program, Protection and Advocacy 
Organizations, Citizen Advocacy Groups, Area Agencies on Aging, Centers for 
Independent Living, and Aging and Disability Resource Centers for additional 
information on long term care facilities and other types of providers of post- hospital care.  
Having access to the information found at these sources may assist in the decision 
making process regarding post-hospital care options.   
 
 
If the patient is enrolled in a managed care insurance program that utilizes a network of exclusive or preferred providers, the hospital must make reasonable attempts, based on information from the insurer, to limit the list to HHAs and SNFs that participate in the insurer’s network of providers.  If the hospital has a disclosable financial interest in a HHA or SNF on a patient’s list, or an HHA or SNF on the list has a disclosable financial interest in the hospital, these facts must also be stated on the list provided to the patient.  Surveyors are not expected to know the requirements for a disclosable financial interest under Part 420, Subpart C, but hospitals are expected to know and comply with these requirements, and to identify for the surveyor whether there are such disclosable financial interests between the hospital and any specific HHAs or SNFs to which they refer/transfer patients.   When the patient or the patient’s family has expressed a preference, the hospital must attempt to arrange post- hospital care with an HHA or SNF, as applicable, which meets 
these preferences.  If the hospital is unable to make the preferred arrangement, e.g ., if there 
is no bed available in the preferred SNF, it must document the reason the patient’s preference could not be fulfilled and must explain that reason to the patient.    Survey Procedures §482.43(c)(6),  §482.43(c)(7) & §482.43(c)(8):  
• Review a sample of cases of patients discharged to HHAs or SNFs to determine if, when applicable, the hospital provided the patient with lists of Medicare-participating HHAs or SNFs.  In making this determination: 
 
• Is there documentation of a list of multiple HHAs or SNFs being provided (including electronically) to the patient?  If not, is there documentation for an acceptable rationale for providing only one option, e.g., the patient’s home is included in the servi ce area of only one Medicare- participating HHA that 
requested to be included on hospital lists, or there is only one Medicare-participating SNF in the area preferred by the patient?  
 
• Ask to see examples of lists of HHAs and SNFs provided to patients prior to discharge.  
 
• Ask the hospital if it has any disclosable financial interests in any HHA or SNF on its lists, or if an HHA or SNF has a disclosable financial interest in the hospital.  If yes, is this stated clearly on the lists?  
 
• Interview staff members involved with the discharge planning process.  Ask them to 
describe how patient preferences are taken into account in the selection of post -
hospital HHA or SNF services.   
 
• Ask the hospital to identify current patients for whom HHA or SNF services are 
planned.  Interview the patient or the patient’s family to ask them:  
 
• Were they presented with a list of HHAs or SNFs, as applicable, to choose from?  
 
• Did the hospital emphasize their freedom of choice?  
 
• Did the hospital arrange for their referral/transfer to an HHA or SNF reflecting their preferences?  If not, did the hospital explain why their choice was not feasible?  
 
• If applicable, were they made aware of disclosable financial interest?

 §482.43(d) Standard:  Transfer or Referral  
 The hospital must transfer or refer patients, along with necessary medical information, to appropriate facilities, agencies, or outpatient services, as needed, for follow -up or ancillary care.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.43(d)  
 The hospital must take steps to ensure that patients receive appropriate post -hospital care by 
arranging, as applicable, transfer to appropriate facilities or referrals to follow -up 
ambulatory care services.  
 “Appropriate facilities, agencies, or outpatient services” refers to entities such as skilled nursing facilities, nursing facilities, home health agencies, hospice agencies, mental health agencies, dialysis centers, suppliers of durable medical equipment, suppliers of physical and occupational therapy, physician offices, etc. which  offer post -acute care services that 
address the patient’s post -hospital needs identified in the patient’s discharge planning 
evaluation.  The term does not refer to non- healthcare entities, but hospitals also are 
encouraged to make appropriate referrals to community- based resources that offer 
transportation, meal preparation, and other services that can play an essential role in the patient’s successful recovery.  
 “Appropriate facilities” may also include other hospitals to which a patient is transferred for 
follow -up care, such as rehabilitation hospitals, long term care hospitals, or even other 
short -term acute care hospitals.   
 Necessary medical information must be provided not only for patients being transferred, but also for those being discharged home, to make the patient’s physician aware of the outcome of hospital treatment or follow -up care needs.  This is particularly important since the 
increasing use of hospitalists in the inpatient hospital setting means the patient’s physician may have had no interaction with the patient throughout the hospital stay.  When the hospital provides the patient’s physician with necessary medical information promptly, among other things, this provides an opportunity for the patient’s physician to discuss with the hospital care team changes to the patient’s preadmission medication regimen or other elements of the post -discharge care plan about which the physician may have questions.  
Facilitating opportunities for such communication and dialogue enhances the likelihood of better patient outcomes after discharge.  
 
The “medical information” that is necessary for the transfer or referral includes, but is not 
limited to:  
 
• Brief reason for hospitalization (or, if hospital policy requires a discharge summary for certain types of outpatient services, the reason for the encounter) and principal diagnosis; 
• Brief description of hospital course of treatment; 
 
• Patient’s condition at discharge, including cognitive and functional status and social supports needed;  
• Medication list (reconciled to identify changes made during the patient’s 
hospitalization) including prescription and over-the-counter medications and herbal.  
(Note, an actual list of medications needs to be included in the discharge information, not just a referral to an electronic list available somewhere else in the medical record.);  
 
• List of allergies (including food as well as drug allergies) and drug interactions; 
 
• Pending laboratory work and test results, if applicable, including information on how the results will be furnished; 
 
• For transfer to other facilities, a copy of the patient’s advance directive, if the patient has one; and  
• For patients discharged home: 
 
• Brief description of care instructions reflecting training provided to patient and/or family or other informal caregiver(s);  
• If applicable, list of all follow -up appointments with practitioners with which 
the patient has an established relationship and which were scheduled prior to discharge, including who the appointment is with, date and time.  
• If applicable, referrals to potential primary care providers, such as health 
clinics, if available, for patients with no established relationship with a 
practitioner.  
 The regulation requires transfer or referral “along” with necessary medical information.  In the case of a patient being transferred to another inpatient or residential health care facility, the necessary information must accompany the patient to the facility.  However, in the case of a patient discharged home who is being referred for follow-up ambulatory care, the transmittal of the information to the patient’s physician may take place up to 7 days after discharge or prior to the first appointment for amb ulatory care services that may have been 
scheduled, whichever comes first.  If the patient’s physician is not yet able to accept the 
information electronically from the hospital, the hospital may provide the information to the 
patient with instructions to give this information to the physician at their next appointment.  
 
For Information – Not Required/Not to be Cited  
 
Scheduling of follow-up appointments for ambulatory care services by the hospital prior 
to discharge has been found to be an effective tool to ensure prompt follow-up and reduce 
the likelihood of a preventable readmission. This follow-up visit shortly afte r discharge 
provides an opportunity for the patient to address any issues or concerns experienced 
after the inpatient stay.  It also provides an opportunity for the primary care physician or 
practitioner to review and reinforce the post-hospital plan of care with the patient, for 
rehabilitation therapy to begin in a timely manner, to clarify any concer ns related to 
medication reconciliation or other adjustments to the patient’s pre -hospital regimen, etc.  
 
It is recognized that hospitals have certain constraints on their ability to accomplish patient transfers and referrals:  
 
• They must operate within the constraints of their authority under State law;  
• A patient may refuse transfer or referral; or  
 
• There may be financial barriers limiting a facility’s, agency’s, or ambulatory care service provider’s willingness to accept the patient.  In such cases the hospital does not have financial responsibility for the post- acute care services. However, hospital s 
are expected to be knowledgeable about resources available in their community to address such financial barriers, such as Medicaid services, availability of Federally Quality Health Centers, Area Agencies on Aging, etc., and to take steps to make those resources available to the patient.  For example, in most states hospitals work closely with the Medicaid program to expedite enrollment of patients eligible for Medicaid.  
 Survey Procedures §482.43(d)  
• Review a sample of records for discharged patients who had a discharge plan to 
determine if:  
 
• For patients discharged home:  
• Necessary medical information was sent to a practitioner with which the patient 
has an established relationship prior to the first post-discharge appointment or within 7 days of discharge, whichever comes first; 
 
• For patients without an established relationship with a practitioner, information 
was provided on potential primary care providers, such as health clinics, if available.  
 
• For patients transferred to another inpatient facility, was necessary medical information ready at time of transfer and sent to the receiving facility with the patient?  
 
• When applicable, there is documentation in the medical record of providing the 
results of tests, pending at time of discharge, to the patient and/or post-hospital 
provider of care?

 §483.43(e) Standard:  Reassessment  The hospital must reassess its discharge planning process on an on-going basis.  The reassessment must include a review of discharge plans to ensure that they are responsive to discharge needs.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §483.43(e)  
 
The hospital must reassess the effectiveness of its discharge planning process on an ongoing 
basis.  Since the QAPI CoP at §482.21 requires the QAPI program to be hospital -wide, the 
discharge planning reassessment process is considered an integral component of the overall 
hospital QAPI program.  
 The hospital must have a mechanism in place for ongoing reassessment of its discharge planning process.  The reassessment process must include a review of discharge plans in closed medical records to determine whether they were responsive to the patient’s post -
discharge needs.  One indicator of the effectiveness of the discharge plan is whether or not the discharge was followed by a preventable readmission.  Accordingly, hospitals are expected to track their readmission rates and identify potentially preventable readmissions.  
 Typically readmissions at 7, 15, 30 days, or even longer, after discharge are tracked by analysts studying readmissions to short -term acute care hospitals.  Hospitals must choose at 
least one interval to track.  Since there are National Quality Forum- endor sed readmissions 
measures that use a 30 -day interval, and since such measures are permitted by law to be 
used by CMS for payment -related purposes, it might be prudent for a hospital to track its 
30-day readmissions rate, but other intervals are permissible .  It is understood that 
information on post -discharge admissions to other hospitals may not be not readily 
available to hospitals, but all hospitals are expected to track readmissions to their own hospital, and to do so on an ongoing basis, i.e., at least  quarterly.  Hospitals may employ 
various methodologies to identify potentially preventable readmissions.  There are proprietary products that, for example, use claims data to identify such cases.  Hospitals are expected to document their methodology for t racking their readmissions rates.  
 Once the hospital has identified potentially preventable readmissions, it is expected to conduct an in- depth review of the discharge planning process for a sample of such 
readmissions (at least 10% of potentially preventable readmissions, or 15 cases/quart er, 
whichever is larger is suggested but not required) in order to determine whether there was 
an appropriate discharge planning evaluation, discharge plan, and implementation of the discharge plan.  
 Hospitals are also expected to follow up on trends identified through analysis of their readmissions, such as a concentration of readmissions related to post -surgical infections, 
discharges from a particular service or unit, discharges to a particular exte nded care facility 
or home health agency, discharges with the same primary diagnosis on the first admission, etc.  Such clustering or concentration may identify areas requiring more follow -up analysis 
and potential remedial actions.    Having identified factors that contribute to preventable readmissions, hospitals are expected to revise their discharge planning and related processes to address these factors.  Consistent with the requirements under the QAPI CoP, the hospital’s governing body, medical leadership and administrative leadership are all expected to ensure that identified problems are addressed, with further ongoing reassessment to achieve improvement.  Survey Procedures §482.43(e)  
 
• Review hospital policies and procedures to determine whether the discharge planning 
process is reassessed on an ongoing basis, i.e., at least quarterly. 
 
• Does the hospital’s discharge planning reassessment policy include tracking and 
analysis of readmissions?  
 
• Do staff know how to obtain data on readmissions that enables them to review the discharge plans for the initial admission?  Ask them to identify medical records for patients who were readmitted and to show you the documentation of the review of the discha rge planning process for the initial admission. 
 
• Does the assessment of readmissions include an evaluation of whether the 
readmissions were potentially preventable?   
 
• Is there evidence of in -depth analysis of a sample of discharge plans in cases where 
preventable readmissions were identified?   
 
• Is there evidence that the hospital took action to address factors identified as contributing to preventable readmissions?

§482.45(a)(1) - Incorporate an agreement with an OPO designated under part 486 of 
this chapter, under which it must notify, in a timely manner, the OPO or a third party designated by the OPO of individuals whose death is imminent or who have died in the hospital.  The OPO determines medical suitability for organ donation and, in the absence of alternative arrangements by the hospital, the OPO determines medical suitability for tissue and eye donation, using the definition of potential tissue and eye donor and the notification protocol developed in consultation with the tissue and eye banks identified by the hospital for this purpose;  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.45(a)(1)  The hospital must have a written agreement with an Organ Procurement Organization (OPO), designated under 42 CFR Part 486
.  At a minimum, the written agreement must 
address the following: 
 
• The criteria for referral, including the referral of all individuals whose death is 
imminent or who have died in the hospital; 
 
• Includes a definition of “imminent death”; 
 • Includes a definition of “timely notification”; 
 • Addresses the OPO’s responsibility to determine medical suitability for organ 
donation;  
 
• Specifies how the tissue and/or eye bank will be notified about potential donors 
using notification protocols developed by the OPO in consultation with the hospital -
designated tissue and eye bank(s);  
 
• Provides for notification of each individual death in a timely manner to the OPO (or 
designated third party) in accordance with the terms of the agreement;  
 
• Ensures that the designated requestor training program offered by the OPO has been 
developed in cooperation with the tissue bank and eye bank designated by the hospital;  
 
• Permits the OPO, tissue bank, and eye bank access to the hospital’s death record 
information according to a designated schedule, e.g., monthly or quarterly;  
 
• Includes that the hospital is not required to perform credentialing reviews for, or 
grant privileges to, members of organ recovery teams as long as the OPO sends only “qualified, trained individuals” to perform organ recovery; and  
 
• The interventions the hospital will utilize to maintain potential organ donor patients 
so that the patient organs remain viable.  
 Hospitals must notify the OPO of every death or imminent death in the hospital. When death is imminent, the hospital must notify the OPO both before a potential donor is removed from a ventilator and while the potential donor’s organs are still viable.  The 
hospital should have a written policy, developed in coordination with the OPO and approved by the hospital’s medical staff and governing body, to define “imminent death.”  The definition for “imminent death” should strike a balance between the needs of t he OPO 
and the needs of the hospital’s care givers to continue treatment of a patient until brain death is declared or the patient’s family has made the decision to withdraw supportive measures.  Collaboration between OPOs and hospitals will create a partn ership that furthers 
donation, while respecting the perspective of hospital staff.  The definition for “imminent death” might include a patient with severe, acute brain injury who:  
 
• Requires mechanical ventilation;  
 
• Is in an intensive care unit (ICU) or emergency department; AND  
 
• Exhibits clinical findings consistent with a Glascow Coma Score that is less than or 
equal to a mutually -agreed -upon threshold; or  
 
• MD/DOs are evaluating a diagnosis of brain death; or  
 • An MD/DO has ordered that life sustaining therapies be withdrawn, pursuant to the 
family’s decision.  
 Hospitals and their OPO should develop a definition of “imminent death” that includes specific triggers for notifying the OPO about an imminent death.  In determining the appropriate threshold for the Glascow Coma Score (GCS), it is important to remember that if the threshold is too low, there may be too many “premature” deaths or situations where there is a loss of organ viability.  Standards for appropr iate GCS 
thresholds may be obtained from the hospital’s OPO or organizations such as The 
Association of Organ Procurement Organizations.  
 
Note that a patient with “severe, acute brain injury” is not always a trauma patient.  For example, post myocardial infarction resuscitation may result in a patient with a beating heart and no brain activity.  The definition agreed to by the hospital and the OPO may include all of the elements listed above or just some of the elements.  The definition should be tailored to fit the particular circumstances in each hospital.  
 Hospitals may not use “batch reporting” for deaths by providing the OPO with periodic lists of patient deaths, even if instructed to do so by the OPO.  If the patient dies during a transfer from one hospital to another, it is the receiving hospital’s responsibility to notify the OPO.  
 “Timely notification ” means a hospital must contact the OPO by telephone as soon as 
possible after an individual has died, has been placed on a ventilator due to a severe brain injury, or who has been declared brain dead (ideally within 1 hour).  That is, a hospital must notify the OPO while a brain dead or severely brain -injured, ventilator -dependent 
individual is still attached to the ventilator and as soon as possible after the death of any other individual, including a potential non- heart -beating donor.  Even if the hospital does 
not consider an individual who is not on a ventilator to be a potential donor, the hospital must call the OPO as soon as possible after the death of that individual has occurred.   
 Referral by a hospital to an OPO is timely if it is made:  
• As soon as it is anticipated that a patient will meet the criteria for imminent death agreed to by the OPO and hospital or as soon as possible after a patient meets the criteria for imminent death agreed to by the OPO and the hospital (ideally, within one hour); AND  
 
• Prior to the withdrawal of any life sustaining therapies (i.e., medical or 
pharmacological support). 
 Whenever possible, referral should be made early enough to allow the OPO to assess the 
patient’s suitability for organ donation before brain death is declared and before the option of organ donation is presented to the family of the potential donor.  Timely assessment of the patient’s suitability f or organ donation increases the likelihood that the patient’s organs 
will be viable for transplantation (assuming there is no disease process identified by the OPO that would cause the organs to be unsuitable), assures that the family is approached only if  the patient is medically suitable for organ donation, and assures that an OPO 
representative is available to collaborate with the hospital staff in discussing donation with the family.  
 It is the OPO’s responsibility to determine medical suitability for organ donation, and, in the absence of alternative arrangements by the hospital, the OPO determines medical suitability for tissue and eye donation, using the definition of potential tissue and eye donor and the notification protocol developed in consultation with the tissue and eye banks identified by the hospital for this purpose.  
 Survey Procedures §482.45(a)(1)  
 
• Review the hospital’s written agreement with the OPO to verify that it addresses all required information. 
 
• Verify that the hospital’s governing body has approved the hospital’s organ 
procurement policies.  
 
• Review a sample of death records to verify that the hospital has implemented its 
organ procurement policies. 
 
• Interview the staff to verify that they are aware of the hospital’s policies and procedures for organ, tissue and eye procurement.  
 
• Verify that the organ, tissue and eye donation program is integrated into the hospital’s QAPI program.

(Rev. 37, Issued:  10- 17-08; Effective/Implementation Date:  10 -17-08) 
 §482.45(a)(2) - Incorporate an agreement with at least one tissue bank and at least one 
eye bank to cooperate in the retrieval, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of tissues and eyes, as may be appropriate to assure that all usable tissues and eyes are obtained from potential donors, insofar as such an agreement does not interfere with organ procurement;  
 Interpretative Guidelines §482.45(a)(2)  
 The hospital must have an agreement with at least one tissue bank and at least one eye bank.  The OPO may serve as a “gatekeeper” receiving notification about every hospital death and should notify the tissue bank or eye bank chosen by the hospital about potential tissue and eye donors.  
 It is not necessary for a hospital to have a separate agreement with a tissue bank if it has an agreement with its OPO to provide tissue procurement services; nor is it necessary for a hospital to have a separate agreement with an eye bank if its OPO provides eye procurement services.  The hospital is not required to use the OPO for tissue or eye procurement but is free to have an agreement with the tissue bank or eye bank of its choice.  The tissue banks and eye banks define “usable tissues” and “usable eyes.”  
 The requirements of this regulation may be satisfied through a single agreement with an OPO that provides services for organ, tissue and eye, or by a separate agreement with another tissue and/or eye bank outside the OPO, chosen by the hospital.  The hospi tal may 
continue current successful direct arrangements with tissue and eye banks as long as the direct arrangement does not interfere with organ procurement.  Survey Procedures §482.45(a)(2)  
 Verify that the hospital has an agreement with at least one tissue bank and one eye bank that specifies criteria for referral of all potential tissue and eye donors, or an agreement with an OPO that specifies the tissue bank and eye bank to which referrals  will be made.  The 
agreement should also acknowledge that it is the OPO’s responsibility to determine medical suitability for tissue and eye donation, unless the hospital has an alternative agreement with a different tissue and/or eye bank.

It is the responsibility of the OPO to screen for medical suitability in order to select 
potential donors.  Once the OPO has selected a potential donor, that person’s family must be informed of the family’s donation options.  Ideally, the OPO and the hospital will decide together how and by whom the family will be approached.  
 Survey Procedures §482.45(a)(3)  
 
• Verify that the hospital ensures that the family of each potential donor is informed of its options to donate organs, tissues, or eyes, including the option to decline to donate.  
 
• Does the hospital have QAPI mechanisms in place to ensure that the families of all potential donors are informed of their options to donate organs, tissues, or eyes, or to decline to donate?

 §482.45(a)(3) - (Continued)
 
 The individual designated by the hospital to initiate the request to the family must be an organ procurement representative or a designated requestor.  A designated requestor is an individual who has completed a course offered or approved by the OPO and de signed in conjunction with the tissue and eye bank community in the 
methodology for approaching potential donor families and requesting organ or tissue donation;  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.45(a)(3)  
 The individual designated by the hospital to initiate the request to a family must be an organ procurement representative, an organizational representative of a tissue or eye bank , or a 
designated requestor.  Any individuals involved in a request for organ, tissue, and eye donation must be formally trained in the donation request process.  
 The individual designated by the hospital to initiate the request to the family must be an OPO, tissue bank, or eye bank representative or a designated requestor.  A “ designated 
requestor” is defined as a hospital -designated individual who has completed a course 
offered or approved by the OPO and designed in conjunction with the tissue and eye bank community.    Ideally, the OPO and the hospital will decide together how and by whom the family will be approached.  If possible, the OPO representative and a designated requestor should approach the family together.  
The hospital must ensure that any “designated requestor” for organs, tissues or eyes has completed a training course either offered or approved by the OPO, which addresses methodology for approaching potential donor families.  Survey Procedures §482.45(a)(3)  
 
• Review training schedules and personnel files to verify that all designated requestors have completed the required training.  
 
• How does the hospital ensure that only OPO, tissue bank, or eye bank staff or 
designated requestors are approaching families to ask them to donate?

§482.45(a)(4) - Encourage discretion and sensitivity with respect to the circumstances, 
views, and beliefs of the families of potential donors;  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.45(a)(4)  
 Using discretion does not mean a judgment can be made by the hospital that certain families should not be approached about donation.  Hospitals should approach the family with the belief that a donation is possible and should take steps to ensure the famil y is treated with 
respect and care. The hospital staff’s perception that a family’s grief, race, ethnicity, religion or socioeconomic background would prevent donation should never be used as a reason not to approach a family. All potential donor families must be approached and informed of their donation rights.  Survey Procedures §482.45(a)(4)  
 
• Interview a hospital -designated requestor regarding approaches to donation requests.  
 
• Review the designated requestor training program to verify that it addresses the use of discretion.  
 
• Review the hospital’s complaint file for any relevant complaints.

 Appropriate hospital staff, including all patient care staff, must be trained on donation issues.  The training program must be developed in cooperation with the OPO, tissue bank and eye bank, and should include, at a minimum:   
• Consent process;  
 
• Importance of using discretion and sensitivity when approaching families;  
 • Role of the designated requestor;  
 
• Transplantation and donation, including pediatrics, if appropriate;  
 • Quality improvement activities; and

§482.45(b) Standard: Organ Transplantation Responsibilities  
 (1)  A hospital in which organ transplants are performed must be a member of 
the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) established and 
operated in accordance with section 372 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 
U.S.C. 274) and abide b y its rules.   The term “rules of the OPTN” means those 
rules provided for in regulations issued by the Secretary in accordance with section 372 of the PHS Act which are enforceable under 42 CFR 121.10.  No hospital is considered to be out of compliance wi th section 1138(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 
or with the requirements of this paragraph, unless the Secretary has given the OPTN formal notice that he or she approves the decision to exclude the hospital from the OPTN and has notified the hospital in writing.  
 (2)  For purposes of these standards, the term “organ” means a human kidney, 
liver, heart, lung, or pancreas.  
 (3)  If a hospital performs any type of transplants, it must provide organ 
transplant related data, as requested by the OPTN, the Scientific Registry, and the OPOs.  The hospital must also provide such data directly to the Department when requested by the Secretary.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.45(b)(1) –(3)  
 If you have questions concerning the facility membership in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network; you may verify the membership by contacting the CMS regional office or by calling the United Network for Organ sharing (UNOS) at 1- 804-330-8500.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.45(b)(1) – (3)

§482.51 Condition of Participation:  Surgical Services  
 If the hospital provides surgical services, the services must be well organized and provided in accordance with acceptable standards of practice.  If outpatient surgical services are offered the services must be consistent in quality with inpatient care in  
accordance with the complexity of services offered.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines  §482.51  
 
The provision of surgical services is an optional hospital service.  However, if a hospital provides any degree of surgical services to its patients, the hospital must comply with all the requirements of this Condition of Participation (CoP). 
 
What constitutes “surgery”?   
 
For the purposes of determining compliance with the hospital surgical services CoP, CMS 
relies, with minor modification, upon the definition of surgery developed by the American College of Surgeons.  Accordingly, the following definition is used to determi ne whether or 
not a procedure constitutes surgery and is subject to this CoP:  
 
Surgery is performed for the purpose of structurally altering the human body by the incision or destruction of tissues and is part of the practice of medicine. Surgery also is the diagnostic or therapeutic treatment of conditions or disease processes by any instruments causing localized alteration or transposition of live human tissue which include lasers, ultrasound, ionizing radiation, scalpels, probes, and needles. The tissue can be cut, burned, vaporized, frozen, sutured, probed, or manipulated by closed reductions for major dislocations or fractures, or otherwise altered by mechanical, thermal, light- based, electromagnetic, or chemical means.  Injection of 
diagnostic or therapeutic substances into body cavities, internal organs, joints, sensory organs, and the central nervous system also is considered to be surgery (this 
does not include the administration by nursing personnel of some injections, subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous, when ordered by a physician).  All of these surgical procedures  are invasive, including those that are performed with 
lasers, and the risks of any surgical procedure are not eliminated by using a light knife or laser in place of a metal knife, or scalpel.  Patient safety and quality of care are paramount and, therefor e, patients should be assured that individuals who 
perform these types of surgery are licensed physicians (physicians as defined in 482.12(c)(1)) who are working within their scope of practice, hospital privileges, and who meet appropriate professional sta ndards.  
 
If surgical services are provided, they must be organized and staffed in such a manner to ensure the health and safety of patients.  
 Acceptable standards of practice include maintaining compliance with applicable Federal and State laws, regulations and guidelines governing surgical services or surgical service locations, as well as, any standards and recommendations promoted by or established by nationally recognized professional organizations (e.g., the American Medical Association, American College of Surgeons, Association of Operating Room Nurses, Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, etc.)  
 Outpatient surgical services must be in compliance with all hospital CoPs including the surgical services CoP.  Outpatient surgical services must be provided in accordance with acceptable standards of practice.  Additionally, the hospital’s outpatient surgical services must be consistent in quality with the hospital’s inpatient surgical services.  Post -operative 
care planning, coordination for the provision of needed post -operative care and appropriate 
provisions for follow -up care of outpatient surgery pat ients must be consistent in quality 
with inpatient care in accordance with the complexity of the services offered and the needs of the patient.  
 The hospital’s inpatient and outpatient surgical services must be integrated into its hospital -
wide QAPI program.  
 Survey Procedures  §482.51 
 
Inspect all inpatient and outpatient operative rooms/suites.  Request the use of proper attire 
for the inspection.  Observe the practices to determine if the services are provided in accordance with acceptable standards of practice.  Observe:  
 
• That access to the operative and recovery area is limited to authorized personnel and that the traffic flow pattern adheres to accepted standards of practice;  
 
• The conformance to aseptic and sterile technique by all individuals in the surgical 
area;  
 
• That there is appropriate cleaning between surgical cases and appropriate terminal 
cleaning applied;  
 
• That operating room attire is suitable for the kind of surgical case performed, that 
persons working in the operating suite must wear only clean surgical costumes, that 
surgical costumes are designed for maximum skin and hair coverage;  
 
• That equipment is available for rapid and routine sterilization of operating room 
materials; 
 
• That equipment is monitored, inspected, tested, and maintained by the hospital’s 
biomedical equipment program and in accordance with Federal and State law, regulations and guidelines and manufacturer’s recommendations;  
 
• That sterilized materials are packaged, handled, labeled, and stored in a manner that 
ensures sterility e.g., in a moisture and dust controlled environment and policies and 
procedures for expiration dates have been developed and are followed in accordance with accepted standards of practice.  
 
• That temperature and humidity are monitored and maintained within accepted 
standards of practice;  
 
• That medical/surgical devices and equipment are checked and maintained routinely 
by clinical/biomedical engineers.  
 
• Verify that all surgical service activities and locations are integrated into the hospital -wide QAPI program.

§482.51(a) Standard:  Organization and Staffing  
 
The organization of the surgical services must be appropriate to the scope of the services offered.  
 Interpretive Guidelines  §482.51(a)  
 When the hospital offers surgical services, the hospital must provide the appropriate equipment and the appropriate types and numbers of qualified personnel necessary to furnish the surgical services offered by the hospital in accordance with acceptable st andards 
of practice.  
 The scope of surgical services provided by the hospital should be defined in writing and approved by the medical staff.  
 
Survey Procedures  § 482.51(a)  
 
Review the hospital’s organizational chart displaying the relationship of the operating room service to other services.  Confirm that the operating room’s organization chart indicates lines of authority and delegation of responsibility within the department or service.

(Rev. 37, Issued:  10- 17-08; Effective/Implementation Date:  10 -17-08) 
 §482.51(a)(1) - The operating rooms must be supervised by an experienced registered 
nurse or a doctor of medicine or osteopathy.  Interpretive Guidelines  §482.51(a)(1)  
 The operating room (inpatient and outpatient) must be supervised by an experienced RN or MD/DO.  The RN or MD/DO supervising the operating room must demonstrate appropriate education, background working in surgical services, and specialized training in the  
provision of surgical services/management of surgical service operations.  The hospital should address its required qualifications for the supervisor of the hospital’s operating rooms in its policies and the supervisor’s personnel file should contain information demonstrating compliance with the hospital’s established qualifications.  
 Survey Procedures  §482.51(a)(1)  
 
• Verify that an RN or a doctor of medicine or osteopathy is assigned responsibility for supervision of the operating rooms.   
 
• Request a copy of the supervisor’s position description to determine that it specifies 
qualifications, duties and responsibilities of the position.  Verify that the supervisor is experienced and competent in the management of surgical services.

(Rev. 37, Issued:  10- 17-08; Effective/Implementation Date:  10 -17-08) 
 §482.51(a)(2) - Licensed practical nurses (LPNs) and surgical technologists (operating 
room technicians) may serve as “scrub nurses” under the supervision of a registered nurse.  
 Interpretive Guidelines  §482.51(a)(2)  
 If the hospital utilizes LPN or operating room technicians as “scrub nurses,” those personnel must be under the supervision of an RN who is immediately available to physically intervene and provide care.  
 Survey Procedures  §482.51(a)(2)  
 
• Determine that an RN is available for supervision in the department or service.  Validate the availability by requesting and reviewing a staffing schedule for the OR. 
 
• Review staffing schedules to determine adequacy of staff and RN supervision. 
 
A-0944 
(Rev. 37, Issued:  10- 17-08; Effective/Implementation Date:  10 -17-08) 
 
§482.51(a)(3) - Qualified registered nurses may perform circulating duties in the 
operating room.  In accordance with applicable State laws and approved medical staff 
policies and procedures, LPNs and surgical technologists may assist in circulatory 
duties under the supervision of a qualified registered nurse who is immediately availabl e to respond to emergencies.  
 Interpretive Guidelines  §482.51(a)(3)  
 The circulating nurse must be an RN.  An LPN or surgical technologist may assist an RN in carrying out circulatory duties (in accordance with applicable State laws and medical -staff 
approved hospital policy) but the LPN or surgical technologist must be under the supervision of the circulating RN who is in the operating suite and who is available to immediately and physically respond/intervene to provide necessary interventions in emergencies.  The supervising RN would not be considered immediately available  if the 
RN was located outside the operating suite or engaged in other activities/duties which prevent the RN from immediately intervening and assuming whatever circulating activities/duties that were being provided by the LPN or surgical technologist.  The hospital, in accordance with State law and acceptable standards of practice, must establish the qualifications required for RNs who perform circulating duties and LPNs and surgical technologists who assist with circulating duties.  
 Survey Procedures  §482.51(a)(3)  
 
• If LPNs and surgical technologists (STs) are assisting with circulating duties, verify that they do so in accordance with applicable State laws and medical -staff approved 
policies and procedures.  
 
• Verify in situations where LPNs and STs are permitted to assist with circulating duties  that a qualified RN supervisor is immediately available to respond to emergencies.  
 
• Verify that RNs working as circulating nurses are working in accordance with 
applicable State laws and medical -staff approved policies and procedures.  
 
A-0945 
(Rev. 37, Issued:  10- 17-08; Effective/Implementation Date:  10 -17-08) 
 §482.51(a)(4) - Surgical privileges must be delineated for all practitioners performing 
surgery in accordance with the competencies of each practitioner.  The surgical service must maintain a roster of practitioners specifying the surgical privileges of each practitioner.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.51(a)(4)  
 Surgical privileges should be reviewed and updated at least every 2 years.  A current roster listing each practitioner’s specific surgical privileges must be available in the surgical suite and area/location where the scheduling of surgical procedures is done.  A current list of surgeons suspended from surgical privileges or whose surgical privileges have been restricted must also be retained in these areas/locations.  
The hospital must delineate the surgical privileges of all practitioners performing surgery and surgical procedures.  The medical staff is accountable to the governing body for the quality of care provided to patients.  The medical staff bylaws must include criteria for determining the privileges to be granted to an individual practitioner and a procedure for applying the criteria to individuals requesting privileges.  Surgical privileges are granted in accordance with the competencies of each practitioner.   The medical staff appraisal 
procedures must evaluate each individual practitioner’s training, education, experience, and demonstrated competence as established by the hospital’s QAPI program, credentialing 
process, the practitioner’s adherence to hospita l policies and procedures, and in accordance 
with scope of practice and other State laws and regulations.  
 
The hospital must specify the surgical privileges for each practitioner that performs surgical tasks.  This would include practitioners such as MD/DO, dentists, oral surgeons, podiatrists, RN first assistants, nurse practitioners, surgical physician assist ants, surgical technicians, 
etc.  When a practitioner may perform certain surgical procedures under supervision, the specific tasks/procedures and the degree of supervision (to include whether or not the supervising practitioner is physically present in the same OR, in line of sight of the practitioner being supervised) be delineated in that practitioner’s surgical privileges and included on the surgical roster.  If the hospital utilizes RN First Assistants, surgical PA, or other non -MD/DO surgical 
assistants, the hospital must establish criteria, qualifications and a credentialing process to grant specific privileges to individual practitioners based on each individual practitioner’s compliance with the privileging/credentialing criteria and in accordance with Federal and State laws and regulations.  This would include surgical services tasks conducted by these practitioners while under the supervision of an MD/DO.  When practitioners whose scope of practice for conducting surgical procedures requires the direct supervision of an MD/DO surgeon, the term “supervision” would mean the supervising MD/DO surgeon is present in the same room, working with the same patient.  
 Surgery and all surgical procedures must be conducted by a practitioner who meets the medical staff criteria and procedures for the privileges granted, who has been granted specific surgical privileges by the governing body in accordance with those criteri a, and 
who is working within the scope of those granted and documented privileges. 
 Survey Procedures §482.51(a)(4)  
 
• Review the hospital’s method for reviewing the surgical privileges of practitioners.  This method should require a written assessment of the practitioner’s training, experience, health status, and performance.  
 
• Determine that a current roster listing each practitioner’s specific surgical privileges is available in the surgical suite and the area where the scheduling of surgical procedures is done.   
 
• Determine that a current list of surgeons suspended from surgical privileges or who have restricted surgical privileges is retained in these areas/locations.

§482.51(b) Standard:  Delivery of Service  
 Surgical services must be consistent with needs and resources.  Policies governing surgical care must be designed to assure the achievement and maintenance of high standards of medical practice and patient care.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.51(b)  
 Policies governing surgical care should contain:  
 
• Aseptic and sterile surveillance and practice, including scrub techniques;  
 
• Identification of infected and non- infected cases;  
 
• Housekeeping requirements/ procedures;  
 
• Patient care requirements:  
 
o Preoperative work -up; 
 
o Patient consents and releases;  
 
o Clinical procedures;  
 
o Safety practices;  
 
o Patient identification procedures;  
 
• Duties of scrub and circulating nurse;  
 • Safety practices;  
 • The requirement to conduct surgical counts in accordance with accepted standards 
of practice;  
 
• Scheduling of patients for surgery;  
 
• Personnel policies unique to the O.R.;  
 • Resuscitative techniques;  
 • DNR status;  
 • Care of surgical specimens;  
 • Malignant hyperthermia;  
 • Appropriate protocols for all surgical procedures performed.  These may be 
procedure -specific or general in nature and will include a list of equipment, 
materials, and supplies necessary to properly carry out job assignment;  
 
• Sterilization and disinfection procedures;  
 
• Acceptable operating room attire;  
 • Handling infections and biomedical/medical waste; and  
 • Outpatient surgery post -operative care planning and coordination, and provisions for 
follow -up care.  
 
Policies and procedures must be written, implemented and enforced.  Surgical services’ policies must be in accordance with acceptable standards of medical practice and surgical patient care.  
 NOTE :  Use of Alcohol -based Skin Preparations in Anesthetizing Locations.  Alcohol -
based skin preparations are considered the most effective and rapid- acting skin 
antiseptic, but they are also flammable and contribute to the risk of fire.  
 It is estimated that approximately 100 surgical fires occur each year in the United States, 
resulting in roughly 20 serious patient injuries, including one to two deaths annually. 
(ECRI, “Surgical Fire Safety,” Health Devices  35 no 2 (February, 2006) 45- 66))  Fires 
occur when an ignition source, a fuel source, and an oxidizer come together.  Heat-
producing devices are potential ignition sources, while alcohol-based skin preparations provide fuel.  Procedures involving electro-surgery or the use of cautery or lasers involve heat-producing devices.  There is concern that an alcohol-based skin preparation, combined 
with the oxygen-rich environment of an anesthetizing location could ignite when exposed to a heat -producing device in an operating room.  Specifically, if the alcohol-based skin 
preparation is improperly applied, the solution may wick into the patient’s hair and linens or pool on the patient’s skin, resulting in prolonged drying time.  Then, if the patient is draped before the solution is completely dry, the alcohol vapors can become trapped under the surgical drapes and channeled to the surgical site. (ECRI for Pennsylvania Patient Safety Advisory 2, No. 2 (June, 2005) 13) 
 
On the other hand, surgical site infections (SSI) also pose significant risks to patients; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), such infections are the third most commonly reported hospital-acquired infections. Although the CD C has stated 
that there are no definitive studies comparing the effectiveness of the different types of skin antiseptics in preventing SSI, it also states that “Alcohol is readily available, inexpensive, and remains the most effective and rapid -acting skin antiseptic.”  (CDC Hospital Infection 
Control Practices Advisory Committee, “Guideline for Prevention of Surgical Site Infection, 1999,” Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology April 1999 (Vol 20 No. 4) 
251, 257)  Hence, in light of alcohol’s effectiveness as a skin antiseptic, there is a need to balance the risks of fire related to use of alcohol -based skin preparations with the risk of 
surgical site infection.  
 The use of an alcohol-based skin preparation in inpatient or outpatient anesthetizing locations is not considered safe, unless appropriate fire risk- reduction measures are taken, 
preferably as part of a systematic approach by the hospital to preventing sur gery-related 
fires.  A review of recommendations produced by various expert organizations concerning use of alcohol- based skin preparations in anesthetizing locations indicates there is general 
consensus that the following risk reduction measures are appropriate:  
 
• Using skin prep solutions that are:  1) packaged to ensure controlled delivery to the patient in unit dose applicators, swabs, or other similar applicators; and 2) provide clear and explicit manufacturer/supplier instructions and warnings.  These instructions for use should be carefully followed. 
 
• Ensuring that the alcohol-based skin prep solution does not soak into the patient’s hair or linens.  Sterile towels should be placed to absorb drips and runs during application and should then be removed from the anesthetizing location prior to draping the patient.  
 
• Ensuring that the alcohol-based skin prep solution is completely dry prior to draping.  This may take a few minutes or more, depending on the amount and location of the solution.  The prepped area should be inspected to confirm it is dry prior to draping. 
 
• Verifying that all of the above has occurred prior to initiating the surgical procedure.  This can be done, for example, as part of a standardized pre- operative “time out” 
used to verify other essential information to minimize the risk of medical errors during the procedure. 
 
Hospitals that employ alcohol-based skin preparations in anesthetizing locations should establish appropriate policies and procedures to reduce the associated risk of fire.  They should also document the implementation of these policies and procedures in t he patient’s 
medical record.  
 
Failure by a hospital to develop and implement appropriate measures to reduce the risk of 
fires associated with the use of alcohol -based skin preparations in anesthetizing locations 
should be cited as condition- level noncompliance.  
 Survey Procedures §482.51(b)  
 
• Review policies and procedures to determine whether they address the elements specified in the interpretive guidelines.  If the hospital uses alcohol -based skin 
preparations in anesthetizing locations, determine whether it has adopted policies and procedures to minimize the risk of surgical fires. 
 
• Interview surgical services staff to determine whether they are aware of and follow hospital policies and procedures.

except in the case of emergencies:  
  (i) A medical history and physical examination must be completed and 
documented no more than 30 days before or 24 hours after admission or registration, and except as provided under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.43 (b)(1)(i)  
 
There must be a complete history and physical examination (H  & P), and an update, if 
applicable, in the medical record of every patient prior to surgery, or a procedure requiring anesthesia services, except in emergencies and, under §482.51(b)(1)(iii), for those specific patients that are not required to have a comprehensive medical history and physical examination, or any update to it, prior to specific outpatient surgical or procedural services as determined by medical staff policy.  The H&P must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of 42 CFR 482.22(c)(5).  
 
• The H&P must be completed and documented no more than 30 days before or 24 hours after admission or registration.  In all cases when it is determined that an H&P is required, except for emergencies, the H&P must be completed and documented before the surgery or procedure takes place, even if that surgery or procedure occurs less than 24 hours after admission or registration.  
 
• If the H&P was completed within 30 days before admission or registration, then an updated examination must be completed and documented within 24 hours after admission or registration.  In all cases when it is determined that an H&P is required, except for emergencies, the update must be completed and documented before the surgery or procedure takes place, even if that surgery or procedure occurs less than 24 hours after admission or registration.

§482.51(b)(2) -  A properly executed informed consent form for the operation must 
be in the patient’s chart before surgery, except in emergencies.  
Interpretive Guidelines §482.51(b)(2)  
Informed consent is addressed in two other portions of the CMS Hospital CoPs and the 
SOM.  Surveyors should review the guidelines for §482.13(b)(2) under Patients' Rights 
and the guidelines for §482.24(c)(2)(v) under Medical Records to understand all requirements related to informed consent. 
 
The primary  purpose  of the informed consent process for  surgical services is to ensure 
that the  patient, or  the patient’s representative, is provided information necessary to 
enable him/her  to evaluate a  proposed surgery before  agreeing  to the  surgery. Typically, 
this information would include  potential short - and longer -term risks and benefits to the 
patient of  the proposed intervention, including the likelihood of  each, based on the 
available clinical evidence, as informed by  the responsible  practitioner’s professional 
judgment. Informed consent must be  obtained, and the  informed consent form must be 
placed in the  patient’s medical record, prior  to surgery, except in the  case of  emergency 
surgery.  
 
Hospitals must assure that the practitioner(s) responsible for the surgery obtain informed 
consent from patients in a manner consistent with the hospital’s policies governing the  
 
informed consent process. 
 
It should be noted that there is no specific requirement for informed consent within the regulation at §482.52 governing anesthesia services. However, given that surgical procedures generally entail use 
of anesthesia, hospitals may  wish to consider specifically extending their informed consent policies 
to include obtaining informed consent for the anesthesia component of the surgical procedure.  
 
Surgical Informed Consent Policy  
The hospital’s surgical informed consent policy should describe the following:  
 
(3) Who may obtain the patient’s informed consent;  
(4) Which procedures require informed consent;  
(5) The circumstances under which surgery is considered an emergency, and may be undertaken without an informed consent;  
(6) The circumstances when a patient’s representative, rather than the patient, may give informed consent for a surgery;  
(7) The content of the informed consent form and instructions for completing it;  
(8) The process used to obtain informed consent, including how informed consent is to be documented in the medical record;  
 
 
(9) Mechanisms that ensure that the informed consent form is properly executed and is in the patient’s medical record prior to the surgery (except in the case of emergency  surgery); and  
 
(10) If the informed consent process and informed consent form are obtained outside the 
hospital, how the properly executed informed consent form is incorporated into the patient’s medical record prior to the surgery.  
 
If there are additional requirements under State law for informed consent, the hospital must comply with those requirements. 
 
Example of a Well -Designed Informed Consent Process  
A well -designed informed consent process would include discussion of the following elements:  
• A description of the proposed surgery, including the anesthesia to be used;  
• The indications for the proposed surgery;  
 
• Material risks and benefits for the patient related to the surgery  and anesthesia, including the 
likelihood of each, based on the available clinical evidence, as informed by  the responsible 
practitioner’s clinical judgment.  Material risks could include risks with a high degree of 
likelihood but a low degree of severity, as well as those with a very low degree of likelihood but 
high degree of severity;  
• Treatment alternatives, including the attendant material risks and benefits;  
• The probable consequences of declining recommended or alternative therapies;  
• Who will conduct the surgical intervention and administer the anesthesia;  
 
• Whether physicians other than the operating practitioner, including, but not limited to, residents , 
medical, advanced practice provider (such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants), and 
other applicable students , will be performing important tasks related to the surgery, or 
examinations or invasive procedures for educational and training purposes , in accordance with 
the hospital’s policies. Important surgical tasks include: opening and closing, dissecting tissue, removing tissue, harvesting grafts, transplanting tissue, administering anesthesia, implanting devices, and placing invasive lines. Examinations or invasive procedures conducted for educational and training purposes include, but are not limited to, breast, pelvic, prostate, and rectal examinations, as well as others specified under state law. 
 
• For surgeries in which residents will perform important parts of the surgery, discussion is 
encouraged to include the following:  
 
• That it is anticipated that physicians who are in approved post graduate residency 
training programs  will perform portions of the surgery, based on their availability and 
level of competence;  
• That it will be decided at the time of the surgery  which residents will participate and their 
manner or participation, and that this will depend on the availability of residents with the 
necessary  competence; the knowledge the operating practitioner/teaching  surgeon has of 
the resident’s skill set; and the patient’s condition; 
• That residents performing surgical tasks will be under the supervision of the operating 
practitioner/teaching surgeon; and  
• Whether, based on the resident’s level of competence, the operating practitioner/teaching surgeon will not be physically present in the same operating 
room for some or all of the surgical tasks performed by residents.  
NOTE :  A “moonlighting” resident or fellow is a postgraduate medical trainee who is 
practicing independently, outside the scope of his/her residency training 
program and would be treated as a physician within the scope of the privileges granted by the hospital. 
 
Whether, as permitted by  State law, qualified medical practitioners who are not 
physicians will perform important parts of the surgery or administer the 
anesthesia, and if so, the types of tasks each type of practitioner will carry out; 
and that such practitioners will be performing only tasks within their scope of 
practice for which they  have been granted privileges by the hospital.  
Informed Consent Forms  
See the guidelines for §482.24(c)(2)(v) under Medical Records for discussion of the 
content of a properly executed informed consent form. 
 
Survey Procedures §482.51(b)(2)  
• Verify  that the hospital has assured that the medical staff has specified which 
procedures are considered surgery and, thus, are those that require a properly 
executed informed consent form. 
• Verify  that the hospital’s informed consent policies address the 
circumstances when a surgery  would be considered an emergency and thus 
not require an informed consent form be placed in the medical record prior 
to surgery.  
• Review a minimum of six medical records of surgical patients and verify  that 
they did not involve emergency surgery  and that they  contain informed consent 
forms that were executed prior to the surgery. When possible, review medical 
records  of patients who are about to undergo surgery, or who are located in a 
surgical recovery  area.  
• Interview two or three post -surgical patients, as appropriate based on their ability 
to provide a cogent response, or the patients’ representatives to see how satisfied 
they are with the informed consent discussion prior to their surgery.

 §482.51(b)(4) -  There must be adequate provisions for immediate post -operative 
care.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.51(b)(4)  
 Adequate provisions for immediate post -operative care means:  
 
• Post-operative care must be provided to all surgical patients, including same -
day surgery patients, in accordance with acceptable standards of practice.  
 
• A post -operative care area, usually referred to as the post -anesthesia care unit 
(PACU), is a separate area of the hospital.  Access is limited to authorized personnel.  
 
• Policies and procedures specify transfer requirements to and from the PACU.  Depending on the type of anesthesia and length of surgery, the post -operative 
check before transferring the patient from the PACU includes, but is not limited to:  
 
o Level of activity; 
 
o Respirations;  
 
o Blood pressure;  
 
o Level of consciousness;  
 
o Level of pain;  
 
o Patient color; and  
 
• If a patient is not transferred to the PACU, determine that provisions are made 
for close observation until the patient has regained consciousness, e.g., direct observation by a qualified RN.   
 Post-operative Monitoring  
 Hospitals are expected to develop and implement policies and procedures addressing the minimum scope and frequency of patient monitoring in post -PACU care settings, 
consistent with accepted standards of practice.  
 Patients receiving post -operative intravenous (IV) opioid medications are of particular 
concern, due to the higher risk for oversedation and respiratory depression
9.  Once out of 
the PACU, patients receiving IV opioid medication may be placed on units where vital 
signs and other monitoring traditionally has not been done as frequently as in the PACU 
or intensive care units, increasing the risk that  patients may deve lop respiratory 
compromise that is not immediately recognized and treated. (See the interpretive 
guidelines at §482.23(c)(4)).  When post -surgical patients are transferred out of the 
PACU to another area of the hospital but continued on IV opioid medications, they need vigilant monitoring, even if post -PACU care is not typically referred to as “immediate” 
post-operative care.  Opioid-  induced respiratory compromise has resulted in inpatient 
deaths that might have been prevented with appropriate assessment a nd vigilant 
monitoring of respiration and sedation levels.
10   
 Survey Procedures §482.51(b)(4)  
 
• Verify that the hospital has provisions for post -operative care.  
 
• Observe care provided to patients in a PACU to determine whether patients are monitored and assessed appropriately prior to transfer or discharge (in the case of same- day surgery patients) from the PACU. 
 
• Does the hospital have a system for identifying and addressing the monitoring 
needs of post -operative patients transferred from the PACU to other areas of 
the hospital?  
 • Ask staff in the PACU and in units who receive patients from the PACU how 
the needs of post -operative patients for vigilant monitoring is addressed when 
the patients are transferred from the PACU to other areas of the hospital.

 §482.52 Condition of Participation:  Anesthesia Services  
 If the hospital furnishes anesthesia services, they must be provided in a well -
organized manner under the direction of a qualified doctor of medicine or osteopathy.  The service is responsible for all anesthesia administered in the hospital.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.52  
 The provision of anesthesia services is an optional hospital service.  However, if a hospital provides any degree of anesthesia service to its patients, the hospital must comply with all the requirements of this Condition of Participation (CoP).  
 
“Anesthesia” involves the administration of a medication to produce a blunting or loss of:  
 
• pain perception (analgesia);  
• voluntary and involuntary movements;  
• autonomic function; and  
• memory and/or consciousness,  
 
depending on where along the central neuraxial (brain and spinal cord) the medication is delivered.  
 In contrast, “analgesia” involves the use of a medication to provide relief of pain through the blocking of pain receptors in the peripheral and/or central nervous system. The patient does not lose consciousness, but does not perceive pain to the extent that may otherwise 
prevail.  
 
Anesthesia exists along a continuum.  For some medications there is no bright line that distinguishes when their pharmacological properties bring about the physiologic transition from the analgesic to the anesthetic effects.  Furthermore, each individual patient may respond differently to different types of medications.  The additional definitions below illustrate distinctions among the various types of “anesthesia services” that may be offered by a hospital.  These definitions are generally based on Americ an 
Society of Anesthesiologists definitions found in its most recent set of practice guidelines (Anesthesiology 2002; 96:1004- 17). 
 
• General anesthesia : a drug- induced loss of consciousness during which patients are 
not arousable, even by painful stimulation.  The ability to independently maintain 
ventilatory support is often impaired.  Patients often require assistance in maintaining a patent airway, an d positive pressure ventilation may be required because of 
depressed spontaneous ventilation or drug- induced depression of neuromuscular 
function.  Cardiovascular function may be impaired.  For example, a patient undergoing major abdomina l surgery involving the removal of a portion or all of an 
organ would require general anesthesia in order to tolerate such and extensive surgical procedure.  General anesthesia is used for those procedures when loss of consciousness is required for the sage and effective delivery of surgical services;  
 
• Regional anesthesia: the delivery of anesthetic medication at a specific level of the 
spinal cord and/or to peripheral nerves, including epidurals and spinals and other central neuraxial nerve blocks, is used when loss of consciousness is not desired but sufficient analgesia and loss of voluntary and involuntary movement is required. Given the potential for the conversion and extension of regional to general anesthesia in certain procedures, it is necessary that the administration of regional and general anesthesia be delivered or supervised by a practitioner as specified in 42 CFR 
482.52(a).  
 
• Monitored anesthesia care (MAC) : anesthesia care that includes the monitoring of 
the patient by a practitioner who is qualified to administer anesthesia as defined by 
the regulations at §482.52(a).  Indications for MAC depend on the nature of the 
procedure, the patient’s clinical condition, and/or the potential need to convert to a general or regional anesthetic.  Deep sedation/analgesia is included in MAC. 
 
- Deep sedation/analgesia: a drug -induced depression of consciousness during 
which patients cannot be easily aroused but respond purposefully following repeated or painful stimulation.  The ability to independently maintain ventilatory function may be impair ed.  Patients may require assistance in 
maintaining a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate.  Cardiovascular function is usually maintained. Because of the potential for the inadvertent progression to general anesthesia in certain pr ocedures, it is 
necessary that the administration of deep sedation/analgesia be delivered or supervised by a practitioner as specified in 42 CFR 482.52(a).  
• Moderate sedation/analgesia: (“Conscious Sedation”):   a drug-induced depression 
of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation.  No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation is adequate.  Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.  CMS, consistent with ASA guidelines, does not define moderate or conscious sedation as anesthesia (71 FR 68690- 1). 
 
• Minimal sedation :  a drug-induced state during which patients respond normally to 
verbal commands.  Although cognitive function and coordination may be impaired, ventilator and cardiovascular functions are unaffected.  This is also not anesthesia. 
 
• Topical or local anesthesia; the application or injection of a drug or combination of 
drugs to stop or prevent a painful sensation to a circumscribed area of the body where a painful procedure is to be performed.   There are generally no systemic effects of these medications, which also are not anesthesia, despite the name.   
 
Rescue Capacity :  As stated above, because the level of sedation of a patient receiving 
anesthesia services is a continuum, it is not always  possible to predict how an individual 
patient will respond.   Further, no clear boundary exists between some of these services.  Hence, hospitals must ensure that procedures are in place to rescue patients whose level of sedation becomes deeper than initially intended, for example, patients who inadvertently enter a state of Deep Sedation/Analgesia when Moderate Sedation was intended.  “Rescue” from a deeper level of sedation than intended requires an intervention by a practitioner with expertise in airway management and advanced life support.  The qualified practitioner corrects adverse physiologic consequences of the deeper -than-intended level of sedation and returns the patient to the originally intended 
level of sedation.  (Rescue capacity is not only required as an essential component of anesthesia services, but is also consistent with the requirements under the Patients’ Rights standard at §482.13(c)(2), guaranteeing patients care in a safe setting.) 
 
Anesthesia services throughout the hospital (including all departments in all campuses 
and off -site locations where anesthesia services are provided) must be organized into one 
anesthesia service.  
 
Areas where anesthesia services are furnished may include (but are not limited to):   
• Operating room suite(s), both inpatient and outpatient;  
 • Obstetrical suite(s);  
 • Radiology department;  
 • Clinics;  
 • Emergency department;  
 • Psychiatry department;  
 • Outpatient surgery areas;  
 • Special procedures areas (e.g., endoscopy suite, pain management clinic, etc.)  
 
The anesthesia services must be under the direction of one individual who is a qualified 
doctor of medicine (MD) or doctor of osteopathy (DO). Consistent with the requirement at §482.12(a)(4) for it to approve medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations, t he 
hospital’s governing body approves, after considering the medical staff’s 
recommendations, medical staff rules and regulations establishing criteria for the qualifications for the director of the anesthesia services.  Such criteria must be consistent with State laws and acceptable standards of practice.  
 As previously mentioned, there is often no bright line, i.e., no clear boundary, between anesthesia and analgesia.  This is particularly the case with moderate versus deep sedation, but also with respect to labor epidurals.  However, the anesthesia service s CoP 
establishes certain requirements that apply only when anesthesia is administered.  Consequently, each hospital that provides anesthesia services must establish policies and procedures, based on nationally recognized guidelines that address whether specific clinical situations involve anesthesia versus analgesia.  (It is important to note that anesthesia services are usually an integral part of “surgery,” as we have defined that term in our guidance.  Because the surgical services CoP at §482.51 requir es provision of 
surgical services in accordance with acceptable standards of practice, this provides additional support for the expectation that anesthesia services policies and procedures concerning anesthesia are based on nationally recognized guidelines . ) We encourage 
hospitals to address whether the sedation typically provided in the emergency department or procedure rooms involves anesthesia or analgesia.   In establishing such policies, the hospital is expected to take into account the characteristic s of the patients served, the skill 
set of the clinical staff in providing the services, as well as the characteristics of the sedation medications used in the various clinical settings. 
 
The regulation at 42 CFR 482.52(a) establishes the qualifications and, where applicable, supervision requirements for personnel who administer anesthesia.  However, hospital anesthesia services policies and procedures are expected to also address the minim um 
qualifications and supervision requirements for each category of practitioner who is 
permitted to provide analgesia services, particularly moderate sedation.  This expectation 
is consistent not only with the requirement under this CoP to provide anesthe sia services 
in a well -organized manner, but also with various provisions of  the Medical Staff CoP at 
§482.22 and the Nursing Services CoP at §482.23  related to qualifications of personnel 
providing care to patients.  Taken together, these regulations re quire the hospital to assure 
that any staff administering drugs for analgesia must be appropriately qualified, and that the drugs are administered in accordance with accepted standards of practice.  
Specifically:    
• The Medical Staff CoP at §482.22(c)(6) requires the medical staff bylaws, “Include criteria for determining the privileges to be granted to individual practitioners and a procedure for applying the criteria to individuals requesting privileges.”  
 
• The Nursing Services CoP requires at:  
 
• §482.23(b)(5) that nursing personnel be assigned to provide care based on 
“the specialized qualifications and competence of the nursing staff available.”  
 
• §482.23(c) that, “Drugs and biologicals must be prepared and administered in 
accordance with Federal and State laws, …and accepted standards of 
practice.”  And  
 
• §482.23(c)(3) , “… If … intravenous medications are administered by 
personnel other than doctors of medicine or osteopathy, the personnel must 
have special training for this duty.”  
 Finally, it is expected that the anesthesia services policies and procedures will undergo periodic re -evaluation that includes analysis of adverse events, medication errors and 
other quality or safety indicators related not only to anesthesia, but also to the administration of medications in clinical applications that the hospital has determined involve analgesia rather than anesthesia.  This expectation is also supported by the provisions of the Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) CoP at §482.21, which requires the hospital to ensure its QAPI program, “…involves all hospital 
departments and services…”;  “…focuses on indicators related to improved health 
outcomes and the prevention and reduction of medical errors....”; “…track[s] quality indicators, including adverse patient events…”; “… use[s] the data collected to monitor 
the effectiveness and safety of the services and quality of care…”; and “…take[s] actions aimed at performance improvement…”  
 Hospitals are free to develop their own specific organizational arrangements in order to 
deliver all anesthesia services in a well -organized manner.  Although not required under 
the regulation to do so, a well -organized anesthesia service would develop the hospital’s 
anesthesia policies and procedures in collaboration with several other hospit al disciplines 
(e.g., surgery, pharmacy, nursing, safety experts, material management, etc.) that are 
involved in delivering these services to patients in the various areas in the hospital.  
 
A well -organized anesthesia service must be integrated into the hospital’s required 
Quality Assessment/Performance Improvement program, in order to assure the provision 
of safe care to patients.  
 Survey Procedures §482.52  
• Request a copy of the organizational chart for anesthesia services.   
 
• Determine that a doctor of medicine or osteopathy has the authority and 
responsibility for directing all anesthesia services throughout the hospital. 
 
• Look for evidence in the director’s file of the director’s appointment privileges 
and qualifications, consistent with the criteria adopted by the hospital’s governing body.  Review the position description. Confirm that the director’s responsibilities include at least the following: 
 
- Planning, directing, and supervising all activities of the service;  
 
- Evaluating the quality and appropriateness of the anesthesia services provided 
to patients as part of the hospital’s QAPI program;  
 
• Request a copy of and review the hospital’s anesthesia services policies and procedures.  
 
- Do they apply in all hospital locations where anesthesia services are provided?  
 
- Do they indicate the necessary qualifications that each clinical practitioner must possess in order to administer anesthesia as well as moderate sedation or other forms of analgesia?  
 
- Do they address what clinical applications are considered to involve analgesia, in particular moderate sedation, rather than anesthesia, based on identifiable national guidelines? What are the national guidelines that they are following and how is that doc umented?  
 
• Does the hospital have a system by which adverse events related to the administration of anesthesia and analgesia, including moderate sedation, are tracked and acted upon?

(Rev. 59, Issued: 05-21-10, Effective/Implementation: 05-21-10) 
 §482.52(a) Standard:  Organization and Staffing  
 The organization of anesthesia services must be appropriate to the scope of the services offered.  Anesthesia must be administered only by --  
(1)  A qualified anesthesiologist;  
 (2)  A doctor of medicine or osteopathy (other than an anesthesiologist); 
 (3)  A dentist, oral surgeon, or podiatrist who is qualified to administer 
anesthesia under State law;  
 (4)  A certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), as defined in §410.69(b) of this chapter, who, unless exempted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, is under the supervision of the operating practitioner or of an anesthesiologist who is immediately available if needed; or 
 (5)  An anesthesiologist’s assistant, as defined in Sec. 410.69(b) of this chapter, 
who is under the supervision of an anesthesiologist who is immediately available if needed.  
 
§482.52(c) Standard:  State Exemption  
 
(1)  A hospital may be exempted from the requirement for MD/DO supervision of CRNAs as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, if the State in which the hospital is located submits a letter to CMS signed by the Governor, following consultation with the S tate’s Boards of Medicine and 
Nursing, requesting exemption from MD/DO supervision of CRNAs.  The letter from the Governor must attest that he or she has consulted with State Boards of Medicine and Nursing about issues related to access to and the quality of anesthesia services in the State and has concluded that it is in the best interests of the State’s citizens to opt- out of the current MD/DO 
supervision requirement, and that the opt -out is consistent with State law.  
 (2)  The request for exemption and recognition of State laws, and the withdrawal of the request may be submitted at any time, and are effective upon submission.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.52(a) and (c)  
Who May Administer Anesthesia  
 Topical/local anesthetics, minimal sedation, moderate sedation  
The requirements at §482.52(a) concerning who may administer anesthesia do not apply 
to the administration of  topical or local anesthetics, minimal sedation, or moderate 
sedation.  However, the hospital must have policies and procedures, consistent with State scope of practice law, governing the provision of these types of anesthesia services.  Further, hospitals  must assure that all anesthesia services are provided in a safe, well -
organized manner by qualified personnel.  
 General anesthesia, regional anesthesia and monitored anesthesia, including deep sedation/analgesia, may only be administered by:  
 
• A qualified anesthesiologist;  
• An MD or DO (other than an anesthesiologist);  
• A dentist, oral surgeon or podiatrist who is qualified to administer anesthesia under State law;  
• A CRNA who is supervised by the operating practitioner or by an anesthesiologist 
who is immediately available if needed; or  
• An anesthesiologist’s assistant under the supervision of an anesthesiologist who is 
immediately available if needed.  
 Administration by an MD/DO/dentist/oral surgeon/podiatrist  
 The hospital’s anesthesia services policies must address the circumstances under which an MD or DO who is not an anesthesiologist, a dentist, oral surgeon or podiatrist is permitted to administer anesthesia.  In the case of a dentist, oral surgeon or podia trist, 
administration of anesthesia must be permissible under State law and comply with all 
State requirements concerning qualifications.  Hospitals should conform to generally accepted standards of anesthesia care when establishing policies governing anes thesia 
administration by these types of practitioners as well as MDs or DOs who are not anesthesiologists.  Administration by a CRNA  
 Unless the hospital is located in a State that has chosen to opt out of the CRNA supervision requirements, a CRNA administering general, regional and monitored anesthesia must be supervised either by the operating practitioner who is performing the procedure, or by an anesthesiologist who is immediately available.  
 Hospitals should conform to generally accepted standards of anesthesia care when establishing policies for supervision by the operating practitioner. An anesthesiologist is 
considered “immediately available” when needed by a CRNA under the 
anesthesiologist ’s supervision only if he/she is physically located within the same area as 
the CRNA, e.g., in the same operative/ procedural suite, or in the same labor and delivery unit, and not otherwise occupied in a way that prevents him/her from immediately conducti ng hands -on intervention, if needed.  
 If the hospital is located in a State where the Governor has submitted a letter to CMS 
attesting that he or she has consulted with State Boards of Medicine and Nursing about 
issues related to access to and the quality of anesthesia services in the State and has concluded that it is in the best interests of the State’s citizens to opt-out of the current 
physician supervision requirement, and that the opt- out is consistent with State law, then 
a hospital may permit a CRNA to administer anesthesia without operating practitioner or anesthesiologist supervision.   (A list of States that have opted out of the CRNA supervision requirement may be found at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/CFCsAndCoPs/02_Spotlight.asp
)   
 A CRNA is defined in §410.69(b) as a “registered nurse who:     (1)  Is licensed as a registered professional nurse by the State in which the nurse 
practices;  
  (2)  Meets any licensure requirements the State imposes with respect to non -
physician anesthetists;   (3)  Has graduated from a nurse anesthesia educational program that meets the 
standards of the Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Programs, or such other accreditation organization as may be designated by the Secretary; and  
  (4) Meets the following criteria:  
   (i)  Has passed a certification examination of the Council on Certification of 
Nurse Anesthetists, the Council on Recertification of Nurse Anesthetists, or any other certification organization that may be designated by the Secretary; or     (ii)  Is a graduate of a program described in paragraph (3) of this definition 
and within 24 months after that graduation meets the requirements of paragraph (4)(i) of this definition.”  Administration by an Anesthesiologist’s Assistant  An anesthesiologist’s assistant may administer anesthesia when under the supervision of an anesthesiologist.  The anesthesiologist must be immediately available if needed.  An anesthesiologist is considered “immediately available” to assist the anesthesiologist’s assistant under the anesthesiologist’s supervision only if he/she is physically located within the same area as the anesthesiologist’s assistant, e.g., in the same operative/procedural suite, or in the same labor and delivery unit, and not otherwis e 
occupied in a way that prevents him/her from immediately conducting hands-on intervention, if needed.  An anesthesiologist’s assistant is defined at §410.69(b) as a “person who-   (1) Works under the direction of an anesthesiologist; 
 
 (2) Is in compliance with all applicable requirements of State law, including any 
licensure requirements the State imposes on nonphysician anesthetists; and  
 
 (3) Is a graduate of a medical school -based anesthesiologist’s assistant education 
program that –  
 
  (a) Is accredited by the Committee on Allied Health Education and 
Accreditation; and  
   (b) Includes approximately two years of specialized basic science and clinical 
education in anesthesia at a level that builds on a premedical undergraduate science background.”  
 Anesthesia Services Policies  
 The medical staff bylaws or rules and regulations must include criteria for determining the anesthesia service privileges to be granted to an individual practitioner and a procedure for applying the criteria to individuals requesting privileges, as require d by the 
regulations at §482. 22(c)(6) for any type of anesthesia services, including those not subject to the anesthesia administration requirements at §482.52(a). The hospital’s governing body must approve the specific anesthesia service privileges for e ach 
practitioner who furnishes anesthesia services, addressing the type of supervision, if any, required.  The privileges granted must be in accordance with State law and hospital policy. The type and complexity of procedures for which the practitioner may administer anesthesia must be specified in the privileges granted to the individual practitioner.  
Deficiencies related to these requirements should be cited under §482. 22(c)(6).  
 When a hospital permits operating practitioners to supervise a CRNA administering anesthesia, the medical staff bylaws or rules and regulations must specify for each category of operating practitioner, the type and complexity of procedures that category of  
practitioner may supervise.  However, individual operating practitioners do not need to be granted specific privileges to supervise a CRNA.  
 Survey Procedures §482.52(a) and (c)  
 
• Review the qualifications of individuals authorized to administer general anesthesia, regional anesthesia and monitored anesthesia, including deep sedation/analgesia to determine if they satisfy the requirements at §482.52(a) and (c).  
 
• Determine that there is documentation of current licensure and, as applicable, 
current certification for all persons administering anesthesia.  
 
• Determine if the state is an “opt -out state” and therefore permits CRNAs to 
administer anesthesia without supervision in accordance with 482.52(c).  
 
• Review the hospital’s policies and procedures governing supervision of CRNA’s 
and anesthesiologist’s assistants, and determine whether they comply with the regulatory requirements. and 
 
• Review the qualifications of individuals authorized to furnish other anesthesia 
services, to determine if they are consistent with the hospital’s anesthesia service policies.

 Interpretive Guidelines §482.52(b)  
 Anesthesia services must be delivered in a manner that is consistent with the needs and the resources of the hospital.  Anesthesia policies at a minimum must address:  
 
• How the hospital’s anesthesia services needs will be met;  
 
• Delivery of anesthesia services consistent with recognized standards for anesthesia care.  A well -designed anesthesia services policy would address issues

 [The policies must ensure that the following are provided for each patient:]  
 §482.52(b) (1)  - A pre -anesthesia evaluation completed and documented by an 
individual qualified to administer anesthesia, as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, performed within 48 hours prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.52(b)(1)  
 A pre -anesthesia evaluation must be performed for each patient who receives general, 
regional or monitored anesthesia.  While current practice dictates that the patient receiving moderate sedation be monitored and evaluated before, during, and after the procedure by trained practitioners, a pre -anesthesia evaluation performed by someone 
qualified to administer anesthesia as specified in §482.52(a) is not required because moderate sedation is not  considered to be “anesthesia”, and thus is not subject to that  
requirement under this regulation.   The evaluation must be performed by someone qualified to administer anesthesia as specified in §482.52(a), i.e., only by:   
• A qualified anesthesiologist;  
 
• A doctor of medicine or osteopathy (other than an anesthesiologist);  
 
• A dentist, oral surgeon, or podiatrist who is qualified to administer anesthesia under State law;  
 
• A certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), who, unless exempted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, is under the supervision of the operating practitioner or of an anesthesiologist who is immediately available if needed; or  
 
• An anesthesiologist’s assistant who is under the supervision of an anesthesiologist 
who is immediately available if needed.  
 
Although §482.12 (c)(1)(i) generally provides broad authority to physicians to delegate 
tasks to other qualified medical personnel, the more stringent requirements at §482.52(b)(1) do not permit delegation of the pre -anesthesia evaluation to practitioners 
who are not qualified to administer anesthesia.  
 
The pre -anesthesia evaluation must be completed and documented within 48 hours 
immediately prior to any inpatient or outpatient surgery or procedure requiring anesthesia 
services.  The delivery of the first dose of medication(s) for the purpose of inducing anesthesia, as defined above, marks the end of the 48 hour time frame.  
 
In accordance with current standards of anesthesia care, some of the individual elements contributing to the pre -anesthesia evaluation may be performed prior to the 48- hour 
timeframe.  However, under no circumstances may these elements be performed more than 30 days prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services.  Review of 
these elements must be conducted, and any appropriate updates documented, within the 48-hour timeframe.  
 The pre -anesthesia evaluation of the patient includes, at a minimum:  
 
Elements that must be performed within the 48 -hour timeframe:  
 
• Review of the medical history, including anesthesia, drug and allergy history; and 
 
• Interview, if possible given the patient’s condition, and examination of the 
patient.  
 
Elements that must be reviewed and updated as necessary within 48 hours, but which may also have been performed during or within 30 days prior to the 48- hour time period, 
in preparation for the procedure:  
 
• Notation of anesthesia risk according to established standards of practice (e.g., ASA classification of risk);  
 
• Identification of potential anesthesia problems, particularly those that may suggest potential complications or contraindications to the planned procedure (e.g., difficult airway, ongoing infection, limited intravascular access);  
 
• Additional pre -anesthesia data or information, if applicable and as required in 
accordance with standard practice prior to administering anesthesia (e.g., stress 
tests, additional specialist consultation); 
 
• Development of the plan for the patient’s anesthesia care, including the type of 
medications for induction, maintenance and post -operative care and discussion 
with the patient (or patient’s representative) of the risks and benefits of the 
delivery of anest hesia.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.52(b)(1)  
 
• Review a sample of inpatient and outpatient medical records for patients who had 
surgery or a procedure requiring administration of anesthesia.  
 
• Determine whether each patient had a pre- anesthesia evaluation by a practitioner 
qualified to administer anesthesia.  
 
• Determine whether each patient’s pre- anesthesia evaluation included at least the 
elements described above.  
 
• Determine that the pre -anesthesia evaluation was updated, completed and 
documented within 48 hours prior to the delivery of the first dose of medication(s) given for the purpose of inducing anesthesia for the surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia ser vices.

§482.52(b)(2) -  An intraoperative anesthesia record.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.52(b)(2)  
 There must be an intraoperative anesthesia record or report for each patient who receives general, regional or monitored anesthesia.  While current practice dictates that the patient receiving moderate sedation be monitored and evaluated before, during, an d after the 
procedure by trained practitioners, an intraoperative anesthesia report is not required because, as explained above , moderate sedation is not “anesthesia”.  Current standard of care stipulates that an intraoperative anesthesia record, at a min imum, includes:  
 
• Name and hospital identification number of the patient;  
 
• Name(s) of practitioner(s) who administered anesthesia, and as applicable, the 
name and profession of the supervising anesthesiologist or operating practitioner;  
 
• Name, dosage, route and time of administration of drugs and anesthesia agents;  
 
• Techniques(s) used and patient position(s), including the insertion/use of any 
intravascular or airway devices;  
 
• Name and amounts of IV fluids, including blood or blood products if applicable;   
• Timed -based documentation of vital signs as well as oxygenation and ventilation 
parameters; and  
 
• Any complications, adverse reactions, or problems occurring during anesthesia, 
including time and description of symptoms, vital signs, treatments rendered, and patient’s response to treatment.   
 Survey Procedures §482.52(b)(2)  
 Review records to determine that each patient has an intraoperative anesthesia record that 
includes the elements described above.

[The policies must ensure that the following are provided for each patient:]  
 482.52(b) (3) - A postanesthesia  evaluation completed and documented by an 
individual qualified to administer anesthesia, as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, no later than 48 hours after surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services.  The postanesthesia evaluation for anesthesia recovery must be completed in accordance with State law and with hospital policies and procedures that have been approved by the medical staff and that reflect current standards of anesthesia care.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.52(b)(3)  
 A postanesthesia evaluation must be completed and documented no later than 48 hours after surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services.  The evaluation is required any time general, regional, or monitored anesthesia has been administered to the pat ient.  
While current practice dictates that the patient receiving moderate sedation be monitored and evaluated before, during, and after the procedure by trained practitioners, a postanesthesia evaluation performed by someone qualified to administer anesthesia as specified in §482.52(a) is not required under this regulation. (71 FR 68691)  
 The postanesthesia evaluation must be completed and documented by any practitioner who is qualified to administer anesthesia; this need not be the same practitioner who administered the anesthesia to the patient.  In accordance with §482.52(a), anesthesia must be administered only by:  
 
• A qualified anesthesiologist;  
 
• A doctor of medicine or osteopathy (other than an anesthesiologist);  
 
• A dentist, oral surgeon, or podiatrist who is qualified to administer anesthesia 
under State law;  
 
• A certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), who, unless exempted in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, is under the supervision of the 
operating practitioner or of an anesthesiologist who is immediately available if needed; or  
 
• An anesthesiologist’s assistant who is under the supervision of an anesthesiologist who is immediately available if needed.  
 
Although §482.12(c)(1)(i ) provides broad authority to physicians to delegate tasks to 
other qualified medical personnel, the more stringent requirements of §482.52(b)(3) do not permit delegation of the postanesthesia evaluation to practitioners who are not qualified to administer  anesthesia.  
 The calculation of the 48 -hour timeframe begins at the point the patient is moved into the 
designated recovery area.  The evaluation generally should not be performed immediately at the point of movement from the operative area to the designated recovery a rea.  Rather, 
accepted standards of anesthesia care indicate that the evaluation should not begin until the patient is sufficiently recovered from the acute administration of the anesthesia so as to participate in the evaluation, e.g., answer questions appropriately, perform simple tasks, etc.  While the evaluation should begin in the PACU/ICU or other designated recovery location, it may be completed after the patient is moved to another inpatient location or, for same day surgeries, if State law and hospi tal policy permits, after the 
patient is discharged, so long as it is completed within 48 hours.  The 48 hour timeframe for completion and documentation of the postanesthesia evaluation is an outside parameter.  Individual patient risk factors may dictate that the evaluation be completed and documented sooner than 48 hours. This should be addressed by hospital policies and procedures (71 FR 68690).  For those patients who are unable to participate in the postanesthesia evaluation (e.g., post-operative sedation, mechanical ventilation, etc.), a postanesthesia evaluation should 
be completed and documented within 48 hours with notation that the patient w as unable 
to participate.  This documentation should include the reason for the patient’s inability to participate as well as expectations for recovery time, if applicable.  For those patients who require long -acting regional anesthesia to ensure optimum m edical care of the 
patient, whose acute effects will last beyond the 48- hour timeframe, a postanesthesia 
evaluation must still be completed and documented within 48 hours.  However, there should be a notation that the patient is otherwise able to participa te in the evaluation, but 
full recovery from regional anesthesia has not occurred and is not expected within the stipulated timeframe for the completion of the evaluation.  
 The elements of an adequate post -anesthesia evaluation should be clearly documented 
and conform to current standards of anesthesia care, including:  
 
• Respiratory function, including respiratory rate, airway patency, and oxygen saturation;  
 
• Cardiovascular function, including pulse rate and blood pressure;  
 
• Mental status; 
 
• Temperature;  
 
• Pain;  
 
• Nausea and vomiting; and 
 
• Postoperative hydration.  
 
Depending on the specific surgery or procedure performed, additional types of 
monitoring and assessment may be necessary.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.52(b)(3)  
 
• Review a sample of medical records for patients who had surgery or a procedure 
requiring general, regional or monitored anesthesia to determine whether a post 
anesthesia evaluation was written for each patient.  
 
• Determine whether the evaluation was conducted by a practitioner who is qualified to administer anesthesia.  
 
• Determine whether the evaluation was completed and documented within 48 hours after the surgery or procedure.

 Interpretative Guidelines §482.53  
 This is an optional hospital service.  However, if a hospital provides any nuclear medicine services to its patients, it must comply with the requirements of this Condition of Participation.  
 
The manner or degree of noncompliance with the requirements of this Condition and its 
component standards must be evaluated to determine whether there is substantial noncompliance with the Condition, warranting a Condition- level citation.   However, the 
regulatory language concerning provision of nuclear medicine services in a manner that 
meets the needs of the patients in accordance with acceptable standards of practice 
appears only in the condition “stem” statement of this CoP.  This does not mean,

statement language.  
 What is Nuclear Medicine and what is it used for?  
 Nuclear medicine uses radioactive material to diagnose or treat a variety of diseases and conditions.    Diagnostic Nuclear Medicine  When a diagnostic nuclear medicine study is performed, a patient inhales, swallows, or is injected with a small amount of a radiopharmaceutical that accumulates in a specific organ or area of the body.  A radiopharmaceutical is a drug that contains a radioactive component.  The energy emitted by the radioactive material is detected by a device, processed and measured by a computer, and then displayed as an image on a screen or on film that is then interpreted by a radiologist specially trained in nuclear me dicine or 
another type of physician with specialized training as a nuclear medicine physician.  The image(s) provide details on both the structure and function of organs and tissues.  For some studies, nuclear medicine techniques can be combined with other medical imaging devices, such as CT scans or MRIs, in which the same machine can deliver, detect, and process several types of images at the same time.  The technique of combining var ious imaging modalities is called hybrid imaging.  Hybrid imaging can 
provide more precise information and accurate diagnoses and is predominantly used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.  
 Nuclear medicine diagnostic imaging scans are commonly performed to:  
 
• Visualize heart blood flow and function, e.g., a cardiac stress test or myocardial 
perfusion scan; this is the most frequent use of nuclear medicine diagnostic imaging.  
• Diagnose blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli) with a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan;  
 
• Identify areas of infection, inflammation, or cancer metastases with a bone scan;  
 
• Localize lymph nodes prior to surgery;  
 
• Determine gastrointestinal tract muscle function by measuring time for swallowing 
and emptying;  
 
• Determine the functioning and perfusion of many other organs, including the thyroid 
gland, kidneys, brain, and gall bladder  
 Therapeutic Nuclear Medicine  Nuclear medicine can also be used to treat various diseases and conditions.  For these types of procedures, a specific radiopharmaceutical agent is used to deliver a specific amount of radioactivity to a targeted cell type or organ.  The energy emitted by the radioactive agent incapacitates or kills the diseased cells of that targeted tissue, and thus limits the exposure of healthy tissue to radioactivity.   
 
Examples of therapies that use nuclear medicine include (but are not limited to):  
 
• Radioactive iodine to treat hyperthyroidism (Graves’ disease);  
• Radioactive antibodies that target specific forms of lymphoma; 
• Radioactive agents to relieve pain in areas of bony metastases.

 §482.53 Condition of Participation:  Nuclear Medicine Services  
 
If the hospital provides nuclear medicine services, those services must meet the needs of the patients in accordance with acceptable standards of practice.  
 Interpretative Guidelines §482.53  
 Nuclear medicine services must be provided in accordance with acceptable standards of practice.  Acceptable standards of practice include maintaining compliance with applicable Federal and State law and regulations governing the use of nuclear medicine, including facility licensure requirements, as well as standards and recommendations 
promoted by nationally recognized professional organizations.  Examples of nationally recognized professional organizations in the area of nuclear medicine include, but are not limited to, organizations such as the American College of Radiology, the Radiological Society of North America, the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, and the American Association of Physicists  in 
Medicine.   
 
If nuclear medicine services are provided under arrangement, the governing body must, 
in accordance with §482.12(e), ensure that the services are provided in a manner that complies with the requirements of the nuclear medicine CoP.   Minimizing the risks of nuclear medicine  
 
Nuclear medicine studies and procedures provide useful diagnostic information and 
targeted therapies for patients.  However, since they use radioactive materials that produce high energy, there are also risks associated with the exposure to radioactivity.  Specifically, the risk involves exposure to ionizing radiation, which is a form of energy given off by atomic particles that can cause damage to DNA in various living tissues.   The most significant risks include, but are not limited to:  
• A small increase in the possibility that a person exposed to ionizing radiation will 
develop cancer later in life.  
 The risk of developing cancer from nuclear medicine radiation exposure is generally small and depends on at least three factors —the amount of the radiation dose, the age 
of the patient or staff member at the time of the exposure, and the sex of the person exposed:  
 
• The lifetime risk of cancer increases the larger the dose and the greater the number of studies or treatments  involving radioactivity which he/she undergoes;  
 
• The lifetime risk of cancer is larger for a patient who received exams that involve 
radioactivity at a younger age, since less mature cells are more radiosensitive; and  
 
• Women are at somewhat higher lifetime risk than men for developing radiation-associated cancers after receiving the same exposures at the same age.  
 In order to minimize the risks of ionizing radiation and maximize patient safety during nuclear medicine studies and procedures, hospitals are expected to apply the fundamental principle of “As Low as Reasonably Achievable” or “ALARA,” which is defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as “A principle of radiation protection philosophy that requires that exposures to ionizing radiation be kept as low as reasonably achievable, economic and social factors being taken into account.  The protect ion from 
radiation exposure is ALARA when the expenditure of further resources would be unwarranted by the reduction in exposure that would be achieved.” (Federal Guidance Report No. 14, Radiation Protection Guidance for Diagnostic and Interventional X -ray 
Procedures, p. 100, November, 2014)Although CMS does not interpret or enforce EPA guidance, the ALARA principle is considered an accepted standard of practice for nuclear medicine that hospitals must adhere to.    Hospitals are expected to be able to demonstrate how they incorporate ALARA into their nuclear medicine services.  They are also expected to have nuclear medicine policies and procedures that take into consideration classes of patients who may be at higher  risk for 
over-exposure, as well as the radiation exposure of staff when preparing, storing, 
transporting, administering and disposing of radioactive materials. 
 
For Information Only – Not Required/Not to be Cited  
 
Hospitals are encouraged to develop protocols for the use of radiopharmaceuticals 
designed to achieve an optimal balance between minimizing the amount of radiation 
exposure while maximizing the diagnostic image quality or therapeutic benefit.   
The risk of excessive exposure for both patients and staff can be reduced by designing 
and implementing nuclear medicine study protocols that: 
• Minimize the distance between the source of radiation and its target; and  
•  Follow published guidelines for administered activity, i.e., the amount of 
radiation administered by the radiopharmaceutical. 
 
 In addition, the hospital’s nuclear medicine services must be integrated into its hospital-
wide Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) program, as required by 
§482.21. Consistent with these requirements, the hospital must monitor the quality and safety of nuclear medicine services.  Examples of nuclear medicine indicators of potential quality and safety problems could include, but are not limited to:  
• Incidents of improper patient preparation, such as inadequate intravenous access or 
lack of pre-medication, such that procedures must be cancelled or reordered; 
 
• Incidents of the wrong radiopharmaceutical being used, i.e., not the radiopharmaceutical prescribed for the patient, or of the wrong dose of the prescribed radiopharmaceutical being administered, or of use of the wrong route of administration for the presc ribed radiopharmaceutical.  
 
• Repeats of the same diagnostic studies within a short time span, which may be an indicator of poor image quality; or 
 
• Diagnostic studies or therapeutic procedures performed in a manner inconsistent with 
the applicable hospital written protocol.   
 In addition, the hospital is also required under the QAPI CoP to track medical errors and 
adverse events related to nuclear medicine services.  Adverse events related to nuclear medicine services must be analyzed for their causes, and preventive actions must then be undertaken.  Deficiencies identified related to tracking, analyzing and addressing adverse event and quality indicator data and perfo rmance improvement activities must be cited 
under the applicable QAPI standards.  Survey Procedures §482.53   
• If nuclear medicine services are offered, determine the type(s) of services provided 
and the location where each service is provided. 
 
• Ask the director of nuclear medicine services how the hospital ensures that the 
services are provided in accordance with acceptable standards of practice.  
 
o Can the director point to accepted guidelines or State or other Federal law that support the hospital’s nuclear medicine policies and procedures?  
 
o Can the director explain how the hospital’s policies, procedures, and protocols are consistent with ALARA principles?  
 
• Observe one or more nuclear medicine studies to determine whether the staff follows 
the hospital’s protocols for that study.  Ask the staff after the observation to show you the applicable protocol and explain how they complied with it.

§482.53(a) Standard: Organization and Staffing  
 
The organization of the nuclear medicine service must be appropriate to the scope and complexity of the services offered.  
 (1) There must be a director who is a doctor of medicine or osteopathy qualified in nuclear medicine.  
 (2)  The qualifications, training, functions and responsibilities of the nuclear medicine personnel must be specified by the service director and approved by the medical staff.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.53(a)  
 The scope of nuclear medicine services offered by the hospital, including which types of diagnostic studies and/or therapeutic procedures are provided, where they are provided in the hospital, and the appropriately- trained staff and equipment needed to provide these 
services must be specified in writing.  Hospitals may choose to provide nuclear medicine 
services in one location or at several different locations in the hospital, including, but not 
limited to, inpatient and outpatient locations of the radiolo gy, cardiology, and oncology 
departments.  The organization of the nuclear medicine service must encompass the full scope and complexity of nuclear services offered throughout the hospital.    Nuclear Medicine Director  
 The hospital is required to have a director responsible for nuclear medicine services 
offered throughout the hospital.  The director must be a doctor of medicine (MD) or osteopathy (DO) and must demonstrate through education, experience and specialized training that he/she is qualified in nuclear medicine.   Nuclear medicine physicians utilize 
radioactive materials to diagnose and treat disease either by interpreting the images 
created by radioisotopes or by prescribing and evaluating therapeutic interventions involving radiopharmaceuticals.  Typically these MDs/DOs initially specialize in radio logy or internal medicine and then complete subspecialty training in nuclear 
medicine.  
 
The hospital must describe in writing the qualifications it requires for the director of 
nuclear medicine services.  
 Other Nuclear Medicine Personnel  
 Although not mentioned specifically in the regulation, there are several different categories of personnel that may typically be involved in the provision of nuclear medicine services, including (but not limited to):  
 
• Nuclear medicine pharmacists: these individuals are pharmacists who specialize in preparing, dispensing, and distributing radiopharmaceuticals;  
 
• Nuclear medicine technologists: these individuals are trained to administer radioactive materials and perform the specific imaging procedures and often process the images for interpretation; and  
 
• Nuclear medicine physicists.  
 The hospital must specify in writing the qualifications, training, functions and responsibilities of each category of personnel used by the hospital, whether personnel are employees or contractors, in the delivery of nuclear medicine services.  The written specifications must be developed by the Director and approved by the hospital’s medical staff.  Qualifications include at a minimum, job title, education, experience, specialized training, and licensure/certification, consistent with any applicable Federa l and State law.  
 The specifications must also address ongoing training for personnel.  
 Survey Procedures §482.53(a)  
 
• Determine whether the scope of the nuclear medicine services offered is specified in 
writing.  
 
• Determine whether there are nuclear medicine policies developed by the director of 
nuclear medicine governing provision of these services in every part of the hospital offering nuclear medicine services.   
 
• Verify that the hospital has a written description of the qualifications of the nuclear 
medicine services director.  
 
• Review the service director’s file to verify that he/she is a MD or DO and has the 
necessary education, experience and specialized training in nuclear medicine, per the hospital’s written policies.  
 
• Verify that the qualifications, training, functions and responsibilities of the various 
categories of nuclear medicine staff the hospital uses are specified by the director and approved by the medical staff.  
 
• Review personnel files for a sample of nuclear medicine staff to determine if they 
meet the prescribed qualifications and have received ongoing training as required in the hospital’s policies and procedures.

 §482.53(b)(2) There is proper storage and disposal of radioactive material.  Interpretive Guidelines §482.53(b) and (b) (2)   The hospital must establish, in writing, and implement policies and procedures addressing the use of radioactive materials within the hospital.  The policies and procedures must be based on acceptable standards of practice for the medical use of radioactiv e materials and must address, at a minimum: 
 
• Security of radioactive materials at every stage and location of their use within the 
hospital, including determining who may have access to them, implementing procedures to control access, and a system to track the receipt, usage and disposal of all radio active materials;  
 
• Safe storage of radioactive materials, including radioactive waste awaiting disposal outside the hospital;  
 
• Clear, recognizable labeling of radioactive materials, waste, and hazardous areas in all locations of the hospital, including during the preparation of such materials, if applicable;  
 
• Safe and secure transport of radioactive materials between locations within the hospital;  
 
• Safe handling with the appropriate personal and container protections, as applicable, by personnel who prepare and administer radiopharmaceuticals within the hospital;  
 
• Protection of patients from radiation hazards, including screening for high- risk 
patients (for example, possible pregnancy, multiple nuclear medicine studies, 
children, etc.);   
• Maintenance and proper use of personal radiation monitoring devices (dosimeters) for staff working in the vicinity of radiopharmaceuticals, according to manufacturer’s instructions, particularly regarding the appropriate placement of the dosimeter on the body, as indicated on the dosimeter;  
 
• Safe and secure disposal of radioactive waste, including unused but unneeded radioactive materials as well as, when extra precautions are applicable, human waste products. 
 Survey Procedures §482.53(b)  
 
• Verify through observation and document review that radioactive materials are 
prepared, labeled, used, transported, stored, and disposed of in accordance with 
hospital policies that are based on acceptable standards of practice.   
 
• Ask the hospital to demonstrate how it limits access to radioactive materials at all 
times.  
 
o Verify that the hospital maintains accurate records of the receipt, distribution, and disposal of radioactive materials, including radiopharmaceuticals.   
 
o If the hospital prepares radiopharmaceuticals on site, observe the preparation to verify that proper safety precautions are utilized to protect staff from excess radiation and once prepared, stored in appropriate containers.  If the radiopharmaceuticals ar e 
obtained from an outside source, verify that the receipt and storage are appropriately tracked.  
 
o Verify that a clear, recognizable label for nuclear material is appropriately displayed in all relevant areas throughout the hospital and on all radioactive materials.  
 
o Verify that safety precautions are followed in the operations of the nuclear medicine service and that personnel and patients maintain and wear appropriate body shielding (e.g., lead aprons, lead gloves, thyroid shields) when appropriate.  
 
 Observe a staff member deliver a nuclear medicine procedure to a patient, paying particular attention to adherence to hospital safety protocols during the delivery of the radiopharmaceutical.  
 
o Through interview and observation, determine if staff use their dosimeters according to manufacturer’s instructions, particularly in the appropriate placement of the dosimeter on the body, as indicated on the dosimeter. 
 
o Ask the responsible staff to demonstrate how they ensure safe transport of radioactive 
materials in the hospital.  
 
o Interview the responsible staff to determine whether the appropriate container protection devices— e.g., lead for gamma emitters —are being utilized for storage and 
administration of radioactive materials.  
 
o Ask staff to show the policy for disposal methods for radioactive waste or unused material and to explain how they ensure that these procedures are followed.

 §482.53(b)(1)  In-house preparation of radio pharmaceuticals is by, or under the  
supervision of, an appropriately trained registered pharmacist or doctor of medicine or osteopathy.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.53(b)(1)  If the hospital prepares radio pharmaceuticals in -house, such preparation must be 
performed by, or supervised by, a registered pharmacist or MD/DO who is qualified through education, experience and training, in the preparation of radio pharmaceuticals, consistent with Federal and State law.  Hospitals must establish policies and procedures 
for in -house preparation of radiopharmaceuticals, including by nuclear medicine 
technologists under supervision.  The policies and procedures must identify the qualifications, roles and responsibilities of staff preparing radiopharmaceuticals under supervision.  The hospital must ensure that all staff who are involved in the preparation and/or supervision of radiopharmaceuticals are trained and demonstrate competencies in accordance with acceptable standards of practice.  
 Hospitals are expected to develop policies and procedures with respect to supervision of nuclear medicine technologists.  CMS anticipates that most hospitals will  follow the supervision recommendations of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imag ing, but there is no mandate that every hospital does so.

able to explain the basis for the supervision policies and procedures it has developed. 
 Survey Procedures §482.53(b)(1)  
o If radio pharmaceuticals are prepared in -house, determine that the preparation 
is performed by, or supervised by, a registered pharmacist or MD/DO. 
 
• Review personnel records of pharmacists, MDs/DOs and nuclear medicine 
personnel involved in the preparation and supervision of radio pharmaceuticals to verify they have required qualifications per State law and hospital policy. 
 
• Verify that the hospital has policies regarding the supervision of nuclear 
medicine personnel and the in- house preparation of radio pharmaceuticals.  
 
• Ask the supervising pharmacist or MD/DO how technicians who prepare radio 
pharmaceuticals are supervised.  Are the supervision policies based on the recommendations of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging?  If not, what is the basis for the supervision policies?  
 
• Ask what policies/procedures the hospital uses to assure proper preparation. 
 
• Ask what guidelines the hospital relies upon for radio pharmaceutical preparation.

§482.53(c) Standard:  Facilities  
 
Equipment and supplies must be appropriate for the types of nuclear medicine services offered and must be maintained for safe and efficient performance.  The equipment must be -- 
(1)  Maintained in safe operating condition; and  
(2)  Inspected, tested and calibrated at least annually by qualified personnel.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.53(c)  
 The nuclear medicine service must use equipment and supplies that are designed and, when applicable, approved to be used in conjunction with radioactive materials.      Equipment must be maintained so that it operates safely to minimize hazards to patients and hospital personnel as much as possible.  Accordingly, it must be inspected, tested, and calibrated by personnel with the necessary qualifications.  Personnel may be  either 
hospital employees or contracted.  Personnel must follow the manufacturer’s quality assurance instructions for acceptance testing (upon installation and after major upgrades) and maintenance testing.  Inspections, testing and calibration must occur  at least annually 
unless required to be more frequent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.    The hospital must have a policy and procedure for staff who operate the equipment to follow if they suspect a malfunction. 
 
Survey Procedures §482.53(c)  
 
• Does the hospital have documentation that indicates that the equipment and supplies it uses in nuclear medicine services are appropriate for use with radioactive materials?  
 
• Is the hospital able to demonstrate how personnel, whether employees or contractors, who inspect, test, calibrate, and maintain nuclear medicine services equipment are qualified to do so?  
 
• Review equipment maintenance records.  Verify that equipment is tested, calibrated 
and otherwise maintained at least annually, following the manufacturer’s recommended procedures.  Verify that if the manufacturer requires more frequent than annual testing and maintenance that the hospital adheres to the manufacturer’s prescribed schedule.  
 
• Ask nuclear medicine services staff who operate equipment what they would do if they suspected a malfunction.  Does the hospital have a policy to address this and are staff familiar with it?

§482.53(d) Standard: Records  
 The hospital must maintain signed and dated reports of nuclear medicine interpretations, consultations, and procedures.  
 (1)  The hospital must maintain copies of nuclear medicine reports for at least 5 years.  
(2)  The practitioner approved by the medical staff to interpret diagnostic procedures must sign and date the interpretation of these tests.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.53(d)(1) & (2)  
 Nuclear medicine patient records, including interpretations, consultations, and procedures are patient medical records and the hospital must comply with the Medical Records CoP (§482.24).   
 Nuclear medicine patient records, like all patient medical records, must be maintained for at least five years.  If State law requires a longer period, the hospital must comply, but surveyors do not assess compliance with State law requirements as part of the Federal survey.  Each report of an interpretation of a nuclear medicine diagnostic study must be signed and dated by the practitioner who made the interpretation, as authorized by the medical staff.  Deficient nuclear medicine medical records practices  related to these two 
requirements must be cited under this regulation; depending on the specific facts, citation under the Medical Records CoP might also be appropriate.  
 Survey Procedures §482.53(d)(1) & (2)  
 
• Verify that copies of nuclear medicine reports are maintained for at least 5 years.  
 
• Verify that reports of nuclear medicine interpretations are signed and dated only by 
the practitioner who interpreted the study’s results, as authorized by the medical staff to perform these interpretations

§482.53(d)(3) -  The hospital must maintain records of the receipt and distribution of 
radio -pharmaceuticals.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.53(d)(3)  
 Hospitals receive their radiopharmaceuticals from manufacturers, either for further in-house preparation, or ready to use.  Regardless of the source of the material, the hospital must have records that track the movement of the radiopharmaceuticals upon receipt, throughout the hospital.  The records must specify:  
 
• the type of radiopharmaceutical;  
• the location in the hospital where it was received, stored and dispensed;  
•  the amount received or dispensed at each location;  
• the staff member receiving or dispensing; and  
• when applicable, how/when it is disposed of and by whom.  This would also include, 
when applicable, the type and amount of any radiopharmaceuticals returned to the source vendor.   
 Additional information, including special transport instructions or precautions, may be included.    The hospital must also have policies and procedures that address how often it reviews these records and how it reconciles discrepancies between inventory on hand and records 
of receipt, distribution, use, disposal and/or return to the source vendor.  
 Surveyor Procedures §482.53(d)(3)  
 
• Ask the hospital to demonstrate how it maintains accurate records of the receipt and 
distribution of radiopharmaceuticals at all locations throughout the hospital.  
•  Ask what the hospital’s policy is for frequency of review of the records; is there evidence that the hospital complies with its policy?  
 
• Ask the hospital to explain how it addresses discrepancies in the records.  
 
• What actions does it take to determine whether there are errors in the records 
versus unaccounted for loss of materials?  
 
• If applicable, what further actions does it take to locate unaccounted for 
radioactive materials?  
 
• If applicable, what further actions does it take to prevent future recordkeeping 
errors?

§482.53(d)(4) -  Nuclear medicine services must be ordered only by practitioners 
whose scope of Federal or State licensure and whose defined staff privileges allow 
such referrals.   
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.53(d)(4)  
 Nuclear medicine services may only be ordered by practitioners holding privileges that permit them to do so, consistent with State scope of practice law.  However, for outpatient services, consistent with the provisions of §482.54, the governing body and medical staff may also authorize practitioners who do not have hospital clinical privileges to order such studies or procedures, as permitted under State law.  
 Survey Procedures §482.53(d)(4)  
 
• Verify that nuclear medicine services are ordered only by practitioners who have 
privileges to do so or, for outpatient services when authorized consistent with the provisions of §482.54, by other practitioners authorized to do so by the medical staff, consistent with Federal and State law.

§482.54 Condition of Participation:  Outpatient Services  
 If the hospital provides outpatient services, the services must meet the needs of the patients in accordance with acceptable standards of practice.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.54  
 This is an optional hospital service; however, if a hospital provides any degree of 
outpatient care to its patients, the hospital must comply with the requirements of this 
Condition of Participation (CoP).  The Medicare Hospital CoP applies to both inpatient and outpatient services of the hospital.  The hospital must be in compliance with the CoP in 42 CFR §482 in all on-campus and off -campus outpatient service locations. 
 Tag A -1081 permits standard- level citations for identified deficiencies and provides more 
detailed guidance on the overall requirements for outpatient services.  
 The manner and degree of noncompliance identified in relation to Tags 1077 – 1080 may result in substantial noncompliance with this CoP, requiring citation at the condition 
level.

§482.54(a) Standard:  Organization  
 Outpatient services must be appropriately organized and integrated with inpatient services.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.54(a)  
 The organization of the hospital’s outpatient services must be appropriate to the scope and complexity of services offered.  
 The hospital’s outpatient services, at all locations, must be integrated with inpatient services (e.g., medical records, radiology, laboratory, surgical services, anesthesia (including pain management) services, other diagnostic services, etc), as appropri ate to 
the outpatient services offered.  The hospital must have written policies in place to assure the integration of outpatient services, including an established method of communication between outpatient service departments to corresponding inpatient s ervices.  
 The hospital must coordinate the care, treatment and services provided to a patient. In order to provide continuity of care, it should have an established method of communication between inpatient services and outpatient care in order to provide continuity of care to its patients.  
 Survey Procedures §482.53(a)  
 
• Verify that the outpatient services are organized in a manner appropriate to the scope and complexity of services offered.  
 
• Verify that the hospital has an established method of communication and 
established procedures to assure integration with inpatient services to provide continuity of care.  
 
• Review medical records of outpatients who were later admitted to the hospital in order to determine that pertinent information from the outpatient record has been included in the inpatient record.  
 
• Determine that each outpatient service location is integrated with the appropriate hospital inpatient services in accordance with the needs of the patient care provided at each of those locations.

§482.54(b) Standard:  Personnel  
 
The hospital must --   
(1) Assign one or more individuals to be responsible for outpatient services.   (2) Have appropriate professional and nonprofessional personnel available at each location where outpatient services are offered, based on the scope and complexity of outpatient services.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.54(b)  
 The hospital’s outpatient services may be directed by one or more individuals.  Hospitals have the flexibility to determine how best to organize their outpatient services, including how direction will be provided.  As services offered in outpatient departm ents become 
more varied, complex and technologically advanced, hospitals may find it better to have individuals with more specialized expertise providing direction for a specific type of outpatient services.   
 Hospitals should define in writing the qualifications and competencies necessary for their outpatient services department leader(s).  These qualifications should include items such as education, experience, and specialized training consistent with State law and acceptable standards of practice.   
 The hospital should define in writing the qualifications and competencies necessary to direct each outpatient service for which there is a separate director.  Qualifications 
include necessary education, experience and specialized training consistent with S tate 
law and acceptable standards of practice.  
 Adequate types and numbers of qualified licensed healthcare professionals and other personnel must be available to provide patients with the appropriate level of care for the outpatient services offered by the hospital.  The types and numbers of qualified personnel required for area of the hospital’s main campus or for each provider -based off -site 
location must be based on the scope and complexity of the outpatient services offered and the number and types of patients treated as outpatients at each.   
 Survey Procedures 482.54(b)   
• Ask the hospital how it has organized its outpatient services and to identify the individual(s) responsible for providing direction for outpatient services.   
 
• Review the organization’s policies and procedures to determine the person’s 
responsibility.  
 
• Review the position description and personnel file of the individual(s) responsible 
for a selection of outpatient services to ensure that they are qualified, in 
accordance with State law, acceptable standards of practice and hospital policy to direct the service for which they are responsible.  
 
• Visit several on - and off -campus locations where hospital outpatient services are 
provided.  Given the scope and complexity of the services being offered, are there sufficient personnel with the appropriate education, experience, certifications, current li censure where appropriate, and competencies for assigned 
responsibilities?  
 
A-1080 
(Rev. 137, Issued: 04 -01-15, Effective: 03 -27-15, Implementation: 03- 27-15) 
 
§482.54(c)  Standard:  Orders for Outpatient Services  
 
Outpatient services must be ordered by a practitioner who meets the 
following conditions:  
 
(1)  Is responsible for the care of the patient.  
(2)  Is licensed in the State where he or she provides care to the patient.  
(3)  Is acting within his or her scope of practice under State law.  
(4)  Is authorized in accordance with State law and policies adopted by the medical staff, and approved by the governing body, to order the applicable outpatient services.   
 This applies to the following:   
(i)  All practitioners who are appointed to the hospital’s medical staff and 
who have been granted privileges to order the applicable outpatient services.  
(ii)  All practitioners not appointed to the medical staff, but who satisfy the 
above criteria for authorization by the medical staff and the hospital for ordering the applicable outpatient services for their patients.   Interpretive Guidelines §482.54(c)  
 Orders for outpatient services may be made by any practitioner who is:  
 
• Responsible for the care of the patient;  
 
• Licensed in, or holds a license recognized in, the jurisdiction where he/she provides care to the patient;  
 
• Acting within his/her scope of practice under State law; and  
 
• Authorized by the medical staff to order the applicable outpatient services 
under a written hospital policy that is approved by the governing body.  
This includes both practitioners who are on the hospital medical staff and who hold medical staff privileges that include ordering the services, as well as other practitioners who are not on the hospital medical staff, but who satisfy the hospital’s policies for ordering applicable outpatient 
services.   
 
This regulation allows hospitals to accept orders for outpatient services both from practitioners who hold hospital privileges as well as practitioners who do not, including those who are not located in the hospital’s close geographic area.  
 It is not uncommon for individuals to obtain health care services in a variety of locations from a variety of practitioners.  Sometimes an individual elects to seek services from a specialist in a tertiary setting removed from the area where the individual  lives, but 
prefers to get follow -up care, such as physical therapy after a surgery, closer to home.  
Sometimes an individual may have multiple residences in different areas and may need to continue care locally when moving between residences.   Sometimes individuals receive urgent or even emergent care while traveling.  Accepting orders and referrals for outpatient services from practitioners not on the medical staff or not holding privileges enables a hospital to promotes ready access to care for patients  in the area it serves.  
Finally, sometimes a practitioner who does not practice in a local hospital may nevertheless refer patients to that hospital for outpatient services, such as diagnostic imaging, physical and occupational therapy, etc.  
 The authority to write orders for outpatient services is covered under the hospital’s medical staff privileging process for members of the hospital’s medical staff and for 
practitioners who have been granted privileges by the hospital without being appoint ment 
to the medical staff.  
 For practitioners who do not hold hospital privileges the hospital’s medical staff policy may permit them to refer patients to the hospital with orders for specific outpatient services so long as all of the above criteria are met.  The policy must address how the hospital verifies the referring/ordering practitioner is appropriately licensed and acting within his/her scope of practice.  The regulation does not prescribe the details of the licensure and scope of practice verification process but instead prov ides a hospital the 
flexibility to accomplish this in the manner it finds efficient and effective.  The hospital is expected to ensure the verification process is followed for all outpatient services in all hospital locations.  The policy must also make clear whether the policy applies to all hospital outpatient services, or whether there are specific services for which orders may only be accepted from practitioners with medical staff privileges.  For example, a hospital may pref er not 
to accept orders for a regimen of outpatient chemotherapy or outpatient therapeutic nuclear medicine services from a referring physician who does not hold medical staff privileges.  In such cases, the hospital’s policy must make these exceptions cle ar to the 
general authorization for accepting orders from referring practitioners.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.54(c)  
 
 Survey a variety of settings that offer outpatient services.  Ask department 
staff whether orders or referrals for that type of outpatient service are accepted from practitioners who do not hold hospital privileges.  If yes:  
 
• Ask for evidence that the medical staff has adopted the policy. 
 
• Ask how the hospital verifies that the order or referral comes from a 
referring practitioner who is appropriately licensed in the jurisdiction where he/she provides care to the patient and is practicing within his/her scope of practice under State law to p rescribe such orders.  Ask 
for documentation of such verification efforts.  
 
• Ensure the same verification process is followed consistently in all outpatient settings.

§482.54 Condition of Participation:  Outpatient Services  
 If the hospital provides outpatient services, the services must meet the needs of the patients in accordance with acceptable standards of practice.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.54  This is an optional hospital service; however, if a hospital provides any degree of outpatient care to its patients, the hospital must comply with the requirements of this Condition of Participation (CoP).  The Medicare Hospital CoP apply to both inpatient and outpatient services of the hospital.  The hospital must be in compliance with the CoP in 42 CFR §482 in all on-campus and off -campus outpatient service locations. 
 All outpatient services provided by the hospital, both on campus and at any provider -
based clinics, must meet the needs of the patients, in accordance with acceptable standards of practice. The hospital must ensure that services, equipment, staff, and facilities are adequate to provide the outpatient services offered at each location in 
accordance with acceptable standards of practice.  
 Acceptable standards of practice include standards that are set forth in Federal or State laws, regulations or guidelines, as well as standards and recommendations promoted by 
nationally recognized professional organizations (e.g., the American Medical 
Association, American College of Radiology, American College of Surgeons, etc.).  
 If the hospital offers outpatient surgical services, the Surgical Services CoP (§482.5) requires that the offered services must be consistent in quality with inpatient care in 
accordance with the services offered.  
 
The hospital’s outpatient services must be integrated into its hospital -wide QAPI 
program.  
 Survey Procedures §482.54  
• Verify that equipment, staff and facilities are adequate to provide the 
outpatient services offered at each location are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice.  
 
• Verify that outpatient services at all locations are in compliance with the

§482.55(a) -  [If emergency services are provided at the hospital --]  
 (2) The services must be integrated with other departments of the hospital;  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.55(a)(2)  
 The hospital’s emergency service/department must be integrated with the other departments of the hospital such as surgical services, lab, ICU, diagnostic services, etc.  The hospital must demonstrate that its emergency services are truly integrated into its other departments.  The integration must be such that the hospital can immediately make available the full extent of its patient care resources to assess and render appropriate care for an emergency patient.  
 Emergency Services integration would include at a minimum:  
 
• Coordination and communication between the Emergency Department and other hospital services/departments; 
 
• Physical access for emergency department patients to the services, equipment, 
personnel, and resources of other hospital departments/services;  
 
• The immediate availability of services, equipment, personnel, and resources of 
other hospital departments/services to emergency patients; and  
 
• That the provision of services, equipment, personnel and resources of other 
hospital departments/services to emergency department patients is within 
timeframes that protect the health and safety of patients and is within acceptable standards of practice, including: 
 
o The length of time it takes to transport the emergency patient from the ED to another hospital department where needed interventions or diagnostic services will be rendered.  
 
o The length of time it takes to deliver equipment or supplies, or for the staff from other departments to travel from their location to the emergency department in order to provide needed interventions, tests, care, or services. 
 Time is critical in the provision of emergency care.  The hospital must be able to demonstrate how the hospital’s other departments provide emergency patients the care and services needed within safe and appropriate times.  
 In emergency care situations, the time needed to provide the patient with appropriate diagnostic and care interventions can have a significant effect on the patient.  Delays in diagnosis and the provision of needed interventions is likely to adversely affe ct the health 
and safety of patients who require emergency care.  Therefore, a hospital that cannot demonstrate integration of its emergency services with its other departments (including radiological services, OR, intensive care, laboratory, etc.) would not be in compliance with the Emergency Services CoP.  
 Many hospitals offer urgent care services on the hospital campus or in provider- based 
clinics in the communities they serve.  Those clinics must be in compliance with the hospital CoP.  Hospitals may organize their urgent care clinics  as part of their outpatient 
department or emergency services department.  An urgent care clinic that:  
 
• The hospital holds out to the public as providing only urgent care services and possibly other services; 
 
• Clearly advises the public that the urgent care clinic is not an emergency services 
department; and  
 
• Does not meet the EMTALA definition of dedicated emergency department; 
 
would be evaluated for compliance with the integration requirement in the Outpatient Services CoP ( §482.54(a)
) rather than the integration requirement in the Emergency 
Services CoP.  In most urgent care situations, the time, qualified personnel, equipment, and other resources needed to provide the patient with appropriate diagnostic and care interventions are les s than needed in emergency situations.

§482.55(b)(1) -  The emergency services must be supervised by a qualified member of 
the medical staff.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.55(b)(1)  
 A qualified member of the medical staff must supervise the provision of emergency services.  Since §482.55(a)(1) requires that emergency services must be organized under 
the direction  of a qualified member of the medical staff, the requirement for supervision  
at§482.55(b)(1) must be distinguished from the prior requirement.  In this context, 
“supervision” implies a more immediate form of oversight by a qualified member of the 
medical staff during all times the hospital makes emergency services available.  A supervisor m ay be briefly absent from the emergency department, but is expected to be in 
the hospital and immediately available to provide direction and/or direct care during the 
operating hours of the emergency department.   
 
The medical staff must establish criteria, in accordance with State law, regulations, and guidelines, delineating the qualifications a medical staff member must possess in order to be granted privileges for the supervision of the provision of emergency car e services.  
Qualifications include necessary education, experience and specialized training, consistent with State law and acceptable standards of practice.

 §482.55(b)(2) -  There must be adequate medical and nursing personnel qualified in 
emergency care to meet the written emergency procedures and needs anticipated by the facility.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.55(b)(2)  
 The hospital must staff the emergency department with the appropriate numbers and types of professionals and other staff who possess the skills, education, certifications, specialized training and experience in emergency care to meet the written emergency procedures and needs anticipated by the facility.  The hospital must determine the categories and numbers of MD/DOs, specialists, RNs, EMTs, and emergency department support staff the hospital needs to met its anticipated emergency needs.  
 The medical staff must establish criteria, in accordance with State law and regulations and acceptable standards of practice delineating the qualifications required for each category of emergency services staff (e.g., emergency physicians, specialist MD/DO , 
RNs, EMTs, mid -level practitioners, etc.).  
 As a suggested prudent practice the hospital should conduct periodic assessments of its emergency needs in order to anticipate the policies, procedures, staffing, training, and other resources that may be needed to address likely demands.  
Additionally, the hospital should work cooperatively with Federal, State and local 
emergency preparedness agencies and officials in order to identify likely risks to the community (e.g., natural disasters, mass casualties, terrorist acts, etc.), to anticip ate 
demands and resources needed by the hospital emergency services, and to develop plans, methods and coordinating networks to address those anticipated needs.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.55(b)(2)  
 
• Verify that there are sufficient medical and nursing personnel qualified in the 
needs anticipated by the facility and that there are specific assigned duties for emergency care personnel and a clear chain of command.  
 
• Interview staff to determine that they are knowledgeable, within their own level of participation in emergency care including:  
 
o Parenteral administration of electrolytes, fluids, blood and blood components;

Condition of Participation: §482.58 Special requirements for hospital 
providers of long-term care services (“swing -beds”)  
 
A hospital that has a Medicare provider agreement must meet the following requirements in order to be granted an approval from CMS to provide post -hospital extended care 
services, as specified in §409.30 of this chapter, and be reimbursed as a swing- bed 
hospital, as specified in §413.114 of this chapter:  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.58  
 Swing -bed services are an optional service. The swing- bed concept allows a hospital to 
use their beds interchangeably for either acute -care or post -acute care. A “swing -bed” is a 
change in reimbursement status. The patient swings from receiving acute -care hospital 
inpatient services and reimbursement to receiving post -acute care skilled nursing facility 
(SNF) services and reimbursement.  A psychiatric hospital is not allowed to have swing-bed approval.  
 Allowing a hospital to operate swing- beds is done by issuing a “swing- bed approval”.  If 
the hospital fails to meet the swing -bed requirements (not the same as the hospital 
conditions of participation (CoPs)), and the hospital does not implement a plan of correction, they lose the approval to operate swing- beds and receive swing -bed 
reimbursement. However, in such a situation, the hospital does not go on a termination 
track. If the hospital continues to meet all other applicable hospital CoPs, it continues to 
participate in Medicare, but loses its swing -bed approval.  
 Swing -beds do not have to be located in a special section of the hospital although a 
hospital may choose to do so. The patient does not have to change locations in the 
hospital merely because their admission status changes unless the hospital requires it. The 
change in status from acute care to swing -bed status can occur within the same part of the 
hospital or the patient can be moved to another part of the hospital for swing- bed 
admission. Likewise, a patient may be discharged from one hospital and admitte d in 
swing bed status to another hospital that has swing bed approval.  
 
Beds in a hospital IPPS -excluded rehabilitation or psychiatric unit, or a separately 
certified co -located Medicare participating entity (e.g., a distinct part SNF/NF, another 
hospital, or an inpatient hospice) cannot be used by the hospital for providing s wing -bed 
services.  
 There must be discharge orders from acute care hospital inpatient services and subsequent admission orders for swing- bed services, the same as if the patient had been 
transferred to a separately certified skilled nursing facility.  The same clinical record  may 
be used for a swing- bed patient, but it must include discharge orders from acute care 
hospital inpatient services and admission orders to swing- bed services, and the swing- bed 
services (which may be SNF or NF level services) must be clearly delineated  within the 
clinical record.  
 There is no length of stay restriction for any hospital swing- bed patient. There is no 
Medicare requirement to place a swing -bed patient in a nursing home and there are no 
requirements for transfer agreements between hospitals and nursing homes. While ther e 
is no length of stay limit for patients in swing -bed status, the intended use for swing beds 
is for a transitional time period to allow the patient to fully recover to return home or while awaiting placement into a nursing facility.  
 The Medicare statute and regulations require that, in order to be eligible for Medicare coverage of post -hospital skilled nursing facility (SNF) or swing- bed care, a beneficiary 
must have a qualifying 3- day inpatient stay in a participating or qualified hospital or 
participating CAH prior to admission to a swing bed in a hospital, or admission to a SNF. This requirement applies only to patients who are Medicare beneficiaries who seek Medicare coverage of their SNF services. It is not evaluated or enforced t hrough the 
survey and certification process, since it is a coverage requirement.  
 In accordance with SOM Section 2037 hospitals seeking swing- bed approval are 
screened prior to survey for their eligibility for swing beds. However, the CMS Regional Office makes the determination whether the hospital has satisfied the eligibility criteria , 
regardless of whether the State Survey Agency or Accrediting Organization, as applicable, recommends approval of swing bed status.  
NOTE :  Swing -beds must not be confused with beds in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) 
or nursing facility (NF), including a distinct part SNF/NF, that shares the same 
building/campus as the hospital but is a separately certified provider with its own Medicare p rovider agreement. 
 
An onsite survey must be conducted and the hospital must meet all the requirements of 
42 CFR 482.58 before the hospital can obtain swing bed approval. S urveyors assess the 
manner and degree of non- compliance with the swing bed standards in determining 
whether there is condition- level compliance or standard- level non -compliance.

§482.58 (a) Eligibility. A hospital must meet the following eligibility requirements:  
 
(1) The facility  has fewer than 100 hospital beds, excluding beds for 
newborns and beds in intensive care type inpatient units (for eligibility of hospitals with distinct parts electing the optional reimbursement method, see §413.24(d)(5) of this chapter).  
 (2) The hospital is located in a rural area. This includes all areas not delineated as “urbanized” areas by the Census Bureau, based on the most recent census.  
 (3) The hospital does not have in effect a 24- hour nursing waiver granted 
under §488.54(c) of this chapter.  
 (4) The hospital has not had a swing -bed approval terminated within the two 
years previous to application. 
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.58(a)  
 Hospitals seeking swing- bed approval are screened prior to survey for their eligibility for 
swing -beds. However, the CMS RO makes the determination whether the hospital has 
satisfied the eligibility criteria, regardless of whether the SA or AO, as applicab le, 
recommends approval of swing- bed status (this responsibility may not be delegated to the 
SA). 
 The eligibility criteria at 42 CFR 482.58(a) requires:  
 
• The hospital has a Medicare provider agreement;  
 
• An initial applicant hospital may seek swing -bed approval.  If the 
applicant hospital meets all Federal requirements for participation, including those for swing- bed approval, the applicant hospital’s approval 
for swing -bed services will be effective with the effective date of the 
hospital’s Medicare participation agreement;  
 
• The hospital has fewer than 100 maintained hospital beds, including any beds in 
IPPS- excluded units, but excluding beds for newborns and beds in intensive care 
type inpatient units;  
 
• The bed -count will be evaluated by surveyors during the survey;  
 
• Even though beds within a hospital’s IPPS -excluded psychiatric or 
rehabilitation unit may not be used for the provision of swing bed services, 
the beds maintained within those units are included with the number of maintained beds within the hospital (that is because the §482.58(a)(1) does not exclude those beds from the count);  
 
• The bed -count is not based on the number of licensed or certified beds, but 
rather the bed -count is based on maintained beds;  
 
• Maintained beds are those patient beds within the Medicare certified 
hospital that are present for use in providing inpatient services, 
observation services, and/or swing -bed services.  
 
• Maintained beds would include:  
 
• Patient beds that are that located within nursing units of the 
hospital;  
 
• Established bed locations in patient rooms where the bed is 
temporarily out of service or temporarily absent from the 
location it routinely occupies; and  
 
• Those beds that are located within nursing units that are 
temporarily closed but are still included on the hospital’s license and which can be brought into service when the 
hospital chooses. 
 
• Maintained beds would not include:  
 
• Examination or procedure tables or stretchers located in 
procedure rooms that are exclusively used for conducting examinations or procedures; and 
 
• Stretchers maintained in nursing units that are solely used for patient transport;  
Note: Maintained beds that are located within intensive care type 
units and those beds that are maintained solely for the use of 
newborns would not be included in the bed count.  
 
• If a Medicare certified hospital has multiple inpatient locations such as 
remote locations or satellites, all maintained beds at each location must be 
combined into a single bed- count.  The total count of maintained beds for 
the Medicare certified hospital  must be less than 100. 
 
• The hospital is located in a rural area.  This includes all areas not 
delineated as “urbanized” areas by the Census Bureau, based on the most 
recent census;  
 
• The CMS RO Division of Survey and Certification (DSC) is responsible for conducting the evaluation as to whether the hospital is located outside of an urbanized area;  
 
• The hospital must be located outside an urbanized area but may be located in an urban cluster (the terms “urbanized area” and “urban cluster” are two distinct classifications of population size used by the U.S. Census Bureau.  An urban cluster is not an “urbanized area”);  
 
• The RO will utilize the U.S. Census Bureau’s most current edition of American Factfinder to determine if the hospital is located outside of an 
area designated as urbanized.  See SOM §2037E for additional instructions;  
 
• In a situation where a hospital has multiple inpatient locations, such as a multi- campus hospital (a hospital with remote locations), or a hospital 
with satellites, each inpatient location must be individually evaluated to determine if it is located outsid e an urbanized area.  When any inpatient 
location of the Medicare certified hospital is located within an urbanized area the hospital does not qualify for swing- bed approval. 
 
• A hospital’s swing bed approval must be terminated if the U.S. Census Bureau delineates the hospital, or any inpatient location of the hospital, as being located within an urbanized area.  
 
• The hospital does not have in effect a 24- hour nursing waiver granted under 42 
CFR 488.54(c);  
 
• The RO must review the hospital’s ASPEN file to determine if the hospital 
has in effect a 24 -hour nursing waiver.  A hospital with this waiver cannot 
have swing- bed approval;  
 
• A hospital that currently has swing- bed approval that seeks and is granted 
a 24-hour nursing waiver under 42 CFR 488.54(c) must have its swing-
bed approval terminated;  
 
• The hospital has not had a swing- bed approval terminated within the two years 
previous to application;  
 
• When a hospital is seeking initial swing -bed approval, the RO will review 
the hospital’s ASPEN file to determine if the hospital previously had 
swing -bed approval that was terminated within the two years previous to 
the application; and  
 
• A request for swing -bed approval will be denied if the hospital has had 
swing -bed approval terminated within the previous two years.  It does not 
matter whether the termination was voluntary or involuntary. 
 
Survey Procedures §482.58(a)  
 
In conducting the survey, verify that the hospital has fewer than 100 hospital beds, excluding beds for newborns and beds in intensive care units.  A hospital licensed for more than 100 beds may be eligible for swing- bed approval if it utilizes and staffs for 
fewer than 100 beds.  Surveyors are to count the beds in each nursing unit.  Do not count beds in recovery rooms, intensive care units, operating rooms, newborn nurseries, or stretchers in emergency departments.  However, do count the beds within IPPS -excluded 
Rehabilitation and Psychiatric Units.

 §482.61 Condition of Participation: Special Medical Record Requirements for Psychiatric Hospitals  
 The medical records maintained by a psychiatric hospital must permit determination of the degree and intensity of the treatment provided to individuals who are furnished services in the institution.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61  
 The clinical record should provide information that indicates need for admission and treatment, treatment goals, changes in status of treatment and discharge planning, and follow -up and the outcomes experienced by patients. The structure and content of the  
individual patient’s record must be an accurate functional representation of the actual experience of the individual in the facility. It must contain enough information to indicate 
that the facility knows the status of the patient, has adequate plans to intervene, and 
provides sufficient evidence of the effects of the intervention, and how their interventions served as a function of the outcomes experienced. You must be able to ident ify this 
through interviews with staff, and when possible with individuals being served, as well as through observations.

 §482.61(a)(1) The identification data must include the patient’s legal status.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(a)(1)  
 Definition: Legal Status is defined in the State statutes and dictates the circumstances under which the patient was admitted and/or is being treated -  i.e., voluntary, involuntary, 
committed by court, evaluation and recertification are in accordance with state requirements.  
 Determine through interview with hospital staff the terminology they use in defining “legal status.” If evaluation and recertification is required by the State, determine that legal documentation supporting this status is present. Changes in legal status s hould also 
be recorded with the date of change.

(Rev. 200, Issued: 02- 21-20; Effective: 02 -21-20, Implementation: 02- 21-20) 
 §482.61(a)(2) A provisional or admitting diagnosis must be made on every patient at the time of admission, and must include the diagnosis of intercurrent diseases as well as the psychiatric diagnosis.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(a)(2)  
 There is an admission or working psychiatric diagnosis (including rule -out diagnoses) 
written in the most current edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or the approved International Classification of Dise ases 
(ICD) nomenclature. This diagnosis is made and entered into the chart of each patient at the time of the admission examination. The final diagnosis may differ from the initial diagnosis if subsequent evaluation and observation support a change.  
 
If a diagnosis is absent, there must be justification for its absence. For example, if a 
patient was psychotic on admission and was not accompanied by family or significant others.  Intercurrent (other than psychiatric) diagnoses must be documented when they are made. 
Attention should be paid to physical examination notes, including known medical 
conditions, even allergies and recent exposure to infections, illness, or substance abuse , 
and to available laboratory or test reports which identify abnormal findings to see that 
these are reflected by appropriate diagnosis.  
 These diagnoses may be found in a variety of locations in the medical record, e.g., the identification/face sheet, the finding of admission physical examination, the psychiatric evaluation the “admission work up “ or the physician’s progress notes. Diagnos tic 
categories should include physical illness when present.  Survey Procedures §482.61(a)(2)  
 Are abnormal physical examination findings and/or laboratory findings justified by further diagnostic testing and/or development of an intercurrent diagnosis, and, if so, was such done?  
If an identified physical illness requires immediate treatment, is the treatment being given?  
How will an identified physical illness be likely to impact on the patient’s eventual outcome? To what extent has this potential impact been addressed by the team?  
 
A-1624 
(Rev. 200, Issued: 02- 21-20; Effective: 02 -21-20, Implementation: 02- 21-20) 
 §482.61(a)(3) The reasons for admission must be clearly documented as stated by the patient and/or others significantly involved.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(a)(3)  
 The purpose of this regulation is to provide an understanding of what caused the patient to come to the hospital, and the patient’s response to admission.  
 The hospital records the statements and reason for admission given by family and by others, as well as the patient (preferably verbatim), with informant identified, in a variety of locations, e.g., in transfer and admission notes from the physician, nurses  and social 
workers.  
 Records should not contain vague, ill -defined reports from unknown sources. Records 
should record “who,” “what,” “where,” “when,” and “why.”  
 Survey Procedures §482.61(a)(3)  
 
Can the patient describe problems, stresses, situations experienced prior to hospitalization 
or do they still exist?  Who is the informant?  
Did the informant witness the patient’s behavior? If not, on what basis has the informant come to know the patient’s behavior?  
Has staff elicited whether the patient has exhibited similar behavior previously? If so, 
what was different this time to make hospitalization necessary?  
Were there other changes/events in the patient’s environment (death, separations of 
significant others) which contributed to the need for hospitalization? If so, has staff explored how these will impact in the patient’s treatment? Has this been addressed b y the 
treatment team?  
Has there been an interruption or change in the patient’s medication which may have been a factor in the patient’s hospitalization?   
A-1625 
(Rev. 200, Issued: 02- 21-20; Effective: 02 -21-20, Implementation: 02- 21-20) 
 §482.61(a)(4) The social service records, including reports of interviews with patients, family members, and others, must provide an assessment of home plans and family attitudes, and community resource contacts as well as a social history.  Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(a)(4)  
 The purpose of the social work assessment is to determine the current baseline social functioning (strengths and deficits) of the patient, from which treatment interventions and discharge plans are to be formulated.  
Patient length of stay is a key factor influencing hospital documentation policy, i.e., establishing timeframes for completion, documentation, and filing of the psychosocial assessment, and treatment planning in the medical record.  
 A psychosocial history/assessment must be completed on all patients. Three key components to be addressed:  
 A. Factual and Historical Information  
1. Specific reasons for the patient’s admission or readmission;  
2. A description of the patient’s past and present biopsychosocial functioning;3. Family and marital history, dynamics, and patient’s relationships with family and significant others;  
4. Pertinent religious and cultural factors;  
5. History of physical, sexual and emotional abuse;  
6. Significant aspects of psychiatric, medical, and substance abuse history and treatment as presented by family members and significant others;  
7. Educational, vocational, employment, and military service history;  
8. Identification of community resources including previously used treatment sources;  
9. Identification of present environmental and financial needs. B. Social Evaluation 
1. Patient strength and deficits;  
2. High risk psychosocial issues requiring early treatment planning and intervention -  i.e., 
unattended child(ren) in home; prior noncompliance to specific treatment and/ or 
discharge interventions; and potential obstacles to present treatment and discharge planning. 
 
C. Conclusions and Recommendations  
Assessment of Sections A and B shall result in the development of (C) recommendations 
related to the following areas:  
1. Anticipated necessary steps for discharge to occur;  
2. High risk patient and/or family psychosocial issues requiring early treatment planning and immediate intervention regardless of the patient’s length of stay;3. Specific community resources/ support systems for utilization in discharge planning -  i.e., 
housing, living arrangements, financial aid, and aftercare treatment sources;  
4. Anticipated social work role(s) in treatment and discharge planning.  
 Survey Procedures §482.61(a)(4)  
 Does the psychosocial history/assessment indicate:  1. Clear identification of the informants(s) and sources of information?  
2. Whether information is considered reliable?  
3. Patient participation to the extent possible in provision of data relative to treatment and discharge planning?  
4. Integration of significant data including identified high risk psychosocial issues (problems) into the treatment plan?  
5. How does the hospital insure the information is reliable?  
 
A-1626 
(Rev. 200, Issued: 02- 21-20; Effective: 02 -21-20, Implementation: 02- 21-20) 
 §482.61(a)(5) When indicated, a complete neurological examination must be recorded at the time of the admission physical examination.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(a)(5)  
 Upon admission the patient should receive a thorough history and physical examination with all indicated laboratory examinations. These investigations must be sufficient to discover all structural, functional, systemic and metabolic disorders. A thorough history of the patient’s past physical disorders, head trauma, accidents, substance dependence/abuse, exposure to toxic agents, tumors, infections, seizures or temporary loss of consciousness, and headaches, will alert the physician to look for the presence  of 
continuing pathology or possible sequelae any of which may turn out to be significant and pertinent to the present mental illness. Equally important is a thorough physical examination to look for signs of any current illness since psychotic symptoms ma y be due 
to a general medical condition or substance related disorder.  
  
The screening neurological examination  
 
As part of the physical examination, the physician will perform a “screening” neurological examination. While there is no precise definition of a screening neurological examination in medical practice such examination is expected to assess gross function o f 
the various divisions of the central nervous system as opposite to detailed, fine testing of 
each division. Gross testing of Cranial Nerves II through XII should be included. 
Statements such as “Cranial Nerves II to XII intact” are not acceptable. These areas may be found in various parts of the physical examination and not just grouped specifically under the neurological. In any case where a system review indicate positive neurological symptomatology, a more detailed examination would be necessary, with neurological work -up or consultation ordered as appropriate after the screening neurological 
examination was completed.   Complete neurological examination.  
 A complete, comprehensive neurological examination includes a review of the patient’s history, physical examination and for psychiatric patients, a review of the psychiatric evaluation. The neurologist/psychiatrist himself/herself also takes a history to o btain the 
necessary information not already available in the medical record or referral form. The neurological examination is a detailed, orderly survey of the various sections of the nervous system. As an example, whereas a simple reading of a printed pag e will be 
sufficient to assess grossly the patient’s sight (cranial nerve II) in a complete neurological examination, the neurologist may test visual acuity with a snellen chart, perform a fundoscopic examination of both eyes (sometimes after dilating the pupils) and he/she 
will examine the patient’s visual fields. In the examination of the motor system, the power of muscle groups of the extremities, the neck and trunk are tested. Where an indication of diminished strength is noted, testing of smaller muscl e groups and even 
individual muscles are tested. In a complete neurological examinations all the systems are examined, but the physician will emphasize even more the areas pertinent to the problem for which the examination was requested.  
 Survey Procedures §482.61(a)(5)  
 Did the presence of an abnormal physical finding or laboratory finding justify the need for further diagnostic testing, or for the development of an intercurrent diagnosis? If the finding justified further follow -up in either situation, was such follow -up done?  
 Is there evidence that a screening neurological examination was done and recorded at the time of the physical examination?   Was the screening neurological or history indicative of possible involvement (tremors, paralysis, motor weakness or muscle atrophy, severe headaches, seizures, head trauma?  
 If indicated, was a complete, comprehensive neurological exam ordered, completed and recorded in the medical record in a timely manner?

(Rev. 200, Issued: 02- 21-20; Effective: 02 -21-20, Implementation: 02- 21-20) 
 
§482.61(b) Standard: Psychiatric Evaluation. Each patient must receive a psychiatric evaluation that must — 
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(b)  
The psychiatric evaluation is done for the purpose of determining the patient’s diagnosis and treatment and, therefore, it must contain the necessary information to justify the diagnosis and planned treatment.  The psychiatric evaluation is a total appraisal or assessment of the patient’s illness. It is the physician’s assessment of the contributing factors and forces in the evolution of the patient’s illness including the patient’s perception of his or her illne ss. Through the 
psychiatric evaluation the physician seeks to secure a biographical -historical perspective 
of the patient’s personality, with a clear psychological picture of the patient as a specific human being with his or her individual problems. While performing the psychiatric evaluation, the physician reaches an understanding of the patient’s basic personality structure, of the patient’s developmental period, of his or her value systems, of his or her past medical history including surgical procedures  and other treatments, his or her past 
psychological traumatic experiences, his or her defense mechanisms, his or her supporting systems, any precipitating factors and how all these may have impacted and interplayed with each other to result in the present  illness. In the psychiatric evaluation 
the patient should emerge as a dynamic human being with a past, a present and a potential future with a thread of logical continuity.   
The psychiatric evaluation includes all the requirements described in this standard and the information necessary to justify the diagnosis and treatment. A physician’s signature is necessary. In those cases where the mental status portion of the psychiatri c evaluation is 
performed by a non- physician, there should be evidence that the person is credentialed by 
the hospital, legally authorized by the State to perform that function, and a physician review and countersignature is present, where required by hospital policy or State law.  
 In order to satisfy the requirements §482.61(b) (1 -7) of this standard, and to meet the 
standards of medical practice, the psychiatric evaluation should include the following component parts:  
 Survey Procedures §482.61(b)  
 The patient’s chief complaints and/or reaction to hospitalization, recorded in patient’s own words where possible. Why is the patient in the hospital? Was it his/her idea? (Does he/she feel ill/disturbed/frightened?) Is the patient in the hospital against his/her will? Who decided to hospitalize/why?  
 
Past history of any psychiatric problems and treatment, including prior precipitating 
factors, diagnosis, course and treatment. Has the patient been chronically ill? Continuously/repeatedly? How severely has the past illness/treatment interfered with the patient’s development and/or adjustment? Are there persistent symptoms/signs/behaviors that must be addressed and treated in order to favorably impact on the future psychiatric 
course? What medications or supports helped him/her improve in the past? Are the  same 
resources available to impact on the patient’s treatment during this episode?  
 Past family, educational, vocational, occupational and social history.  To what extent, if any, is there a presence or absence of familial predisposition? What is the patient’s educational level? Was he/she a good student? Is he/she still interested in learning? What jobs has the patient held? For how long? Is he/she now employed/unemployed? For how long? Has he/she ever worked? How does the patient get along with people? As a child, did he/she have friends? Does he/she have friends now? Within the psychiat ric evaluation 
does one find the specific signs and symptoms, and other factors, that justify the diagnosis?

 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(b)(2)  
 The psychiatric evaluation must include the non- psychiatric medical history including 
physical disabilities, intellectual disabilities and treatment.  
 
Survey Procedures §482.61(b)(2)  
 Does the evaluation include:  Relevant past surgery? Past medical conditions and disabilities especially those of a chronic nature?  
Have these contributed to the patient’s psychiatric condition? How?  
Are any of these conditions still present to any significant degree? Are they likely to impact on the patient’s recovery/remission? Should they be addressed immediately? Does the facility have the capability to intervene? If not, how is the need to be met?

§482.61(b)(3) Contain a record of mental status;  
 
Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(b)(3)  
 
The mental status must describe the appearance and behavior, emotional response, 
verbalization, thought content, and cognition of the patient as reported by the patient and 
observed by the examiner at the time of the examination. This description is appropriate to the patient’s condition.  Explore the mental status for descriptions of the patient’s presentation during the examination that are relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of the patient. An example of a portion of the patient interview: The patient periodically states the examiner’ s name 
correctly during this examination after hearing it once, accurately describes his past history in great detail, precisely characterizes his present situation, can list events in logical sequence that have led to his present illness, but believes tha t his pre -admission 
insomnia, anorexia, and 35 pound weight loss over the past four months are totally the result of his sexual promiscuity of ten years ago and have nothing to do with his concurrent use of 50 to 60 mg. of Amphetamine daily.” From this inf ormation one can 
conclude that the patient is oriented, his memory is intact, but that he has poor judgment and no insight. It is not acceptable just to write “oriented, memory intact, judgment poor, and insight nil,” without any supportive information.

 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(b)(4)  
 In a hospitalized patient, the identified problem should be related to the patient’s need for hospital admission. The psychiatric evaluation includes a history of present illness, including onset, precipitating factors and reason for the current admission, signs and symptoms, course, and the results of any treatment received.  
 Survey Procedures §482.61(b)(4)  
 How long has the patient been ill? Was it a gradual or sudden onset?  
Is this a recurrence?  
What were the precipitating factors? What happened?  
What symptoms, signs, behaviors made this hospitalization necessary?  
What treatment has the patient already received before coming to the hospital?  Is any medication he received listed?

 §482.61(b)(7) Include an inventory of the patient’s assets in descriptive, not interpretive fashion.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(b)(7)  
 Although the term strength is often used interchangeably with assets, only the assets that describe personal factors on which to base the treatment plan or which are useful in therapy represent personal strengths. Strengths are personal attributes i.e., knowledge, interests, skills, aptitudes, personal experiences, education, talents and employment status, which may be useful in developing a meaningful treatment plan. For purposes of the regulation, words such as “youth,” “pretty,” “Social Security income,”  and “has a 
car” do not represent assets. (See also §482.61(c)(1).)  
  
A-1640 
(Rev. 200, Issued: 02- 21-20; Effective: 02 -21-20, Implementation: 02- 21-20) 
 §482.61(c)(1) Standard Treatment Plan. Each patient must have an individualized, comprehensive treatment plan based on an inventory of the patient’s strengths and disabilities.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(c)(1)  
 
The patient and treatment team collaboratively develop the patient’s treatment plan. The treatment plan is the outline of what the hospital has committed itself to do for the patient, based on an assessment of the patient’s needs. The facility selects its format for treatment plans and treatment plan updates.  
 
Survey Procedure §482.61(c)(1)  
 
Determination of compliance regarding treatment plans is accomplished by the surveyor using the following methods, and to the extent possible, the following order:  1. Observation of the patient and staff at planned therapies/meetings, in various settings both on and off the patient units, in formal and informal staff -patient interactions and in a 
variety of daily settings;  2. Interviews with patients, families, treatment staff and others involved directly or indirectly with active treatment;  3. Reviews of scheduled treatment programs (individual, group, family meetings, therapeutic activities, therapeutic procedures);  
4. Attendance at multidisciplinary treatment planning meetings, if time permits; and  
5. Medical record review.  
 Has the information gained from assessing/evaluating the patient been utilized to create an individualized treatment plan?  
 A disability is any psychiatric, biopsychosocial problem requiring treatment/intervention. The term disability and problem are used interchangeably. The treatment plan is derived 
from the information contained in the psychiatric evaluation and in the asses sments/diagnostic data collected by the total treatment team. Based on the 
assessment summaries formulated by team members of various disciplines, the treatment team identifies which patient disabilities will be treated during hospitalization. Patient strengths that can be utilized in treatment must be identified. (See also §482.61(b)(7).)  
Treatment planning depends on several variables; whether the admission is limited to crisis intervention, short -term treatment or long -term treatment. The briefer the hospital 
stay, the fewer disciplines may be involved in the patient’s treatment.  
 There must be evidence of periodic review of the patient’s response and progress toward meeting planned goals. If the patient has made progress toward meeting goals, or if there is a lack of progress, the review must justify: (1) continuing with the curren t goals and 
approaches; or (2) revising the treatment plan to increase the possibility of a successful treatment outcome.  
 Consideration must be given to the type of psychiatric program(s) under review to determine the timeframe for treatment plan review. The interval within which treatment plan reviews are conducted is determined by the hospital, however, the hospital’s revie w 
system must be sufficiently responsive to ensure the treatment plan is reviewed: whenever a goal(s) has been accomplished; when a patient is regressing; when a patient is failing to progress; or when a patient requires a new treatment goal. The facility is 
expected to pursue aggressively the attendance of all relevant participants at the team 
meetings. Question any routine and regular absences of individuals who would be expected to attend.  
Is the treatment plan individualized, i.e., patient -specific, or is there a predictable 
sameness from plan to plan?  
 
When packaged plans or programs are used, do staff include needed individual 
adaptations in the plan?  
 Are the patient’s observed behaviors consistent with the problems and strengths identified in the plan or update?  
 Have the views which the patient communicated to the surveyor regarding problems which require treatment during hospitalization and plans for discharge, been incorporated in the plan or update?

 §482.61(c)(1)(i) The written plan must include —A substantiated diagnosis;  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(c)(1)(i)  
 The substantiated diagnosis serves as the basis for treatment interventions. A substantiated diagnosis is the diagnosis identified by the treatment team to be the primary focus upon which treatment planning will be based. It evolves from the synthesis of data from various disciplines.  
 At the time of admission, the patient may have been given an initial diagnosis or a rule -
out diagnosis. At the time of treatment planning, a substantiated diagnosis must be recorded. It may be the same as the initial diagnosis, or, based on new information and assessment, it may differ.  
 Rule -out diagnoses, by themselves are not acceptable as a substantiated diagnosis. 
 Data to substantiate the diagnosis may be found in, but is not limited to, the psychiatric evaluation, the medical history and physical examination, laboratory tests, medical and other psychological consults, assessments done by disciplines involved in pat ient 
evaluations and information supplied from other sources such as community agencies and significant others.

 What specific problems will be treated during the patient’s hospitalization?   
Does the treatment plan identify and precisely describe problem behaviors rather than 
generalized statements i.e., “paranoid,” “aggressive,” “depressed?” or generic terminology i.e., “alteration in thought process,” “ineffective coping,” “alteration in mood?”  
Are physical problems identified and included in the treatment plan if they require 
treatment, or interfere with treatment, during the patient’s hospitalization?

§482.61(c)(1)(ii) Short -term and long range goals;  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(c)(1)(ii)  
 Based on the problems identified for treatment, short- term and long- range goals are 
developed. Whether the use of short -term or a combination of short -term and long- range 
goals is appropriate is dependent on the length of hospital stay.  Short -term and long- range goals include specific dates for expected achievement. As 
goals are achieved, the treatment plan should be revised. When a goal is modified, changed or discontinued without achievement, the plan should be reviewed for relevancy, and updated as needed.  
 In crisis intervention and short -term treatment there may be only one timeframe for 
treatment goals. As the length of hospital stay increases (often because of the long- term 
chronic nature of the patient’s illness), both long- range and short -term goals are needed.  
 The long- range goal is achieved through the development of a series of short -term goals, 
i.e., smaller, logical sequential steps which will result in reaching the long -range goal. 
Both the short -term and long- range goals must be stated as expected behavior al outcomes 
for the patient. Goals must be related to the problems identified for treatment. Goals must be written as observable, measurable patient behaviors to be achieved. Discharge criteria may be included as long- range goals.  
 Survey Procedures §482.61(c)(1)(ii)  
 How do treatment plan goals relate to the problems being treated?  
 Do goals indicate the outcomes to be achieved by the patient?  
 Are the goals written in a way that allow changes in the patient’s behavior to be measured?

§482.61(c)(1)(iii) The specific treatment modalities utilized;  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(c)(1)(iii)  
 This requirement refers to all of the planned treatment modalities used to treat the patient during hospitalization. Having identified the problems requiring treatment, and defining outcome goals to be achieved, appropriate treatment approaches must be ide ntified.  
 Modalities include all of the active treatment measures provided to the patient. It describes the treatment that will be provided to the patient. It describes the treatment that will be provided by various staff.  
 A daily schedule of unit activities does not, in itself, constitute planned modalities of treatment. It is expected that when a patient attends various treatment modalities/activities, it is a part of individualized planning with a specific purpose and focus for that patient.  
 Simply “naming” modalities (i.e., individual therapy, group therapy, occupational therapy, medication education) is not acceptable. The focus of the treatment must be included.   Simply “stating” modality approaches (i.e., “set limits,” “encourage socialization,” “discharge planning as needed”) is not acceptable. Modality approaches must be 
specifically described in order to assure consistency of approach.  
 Observation of staff implementing treatment, both in structured and non- structured 
settings, is a major criterion to determine whether active treatment is being provided in accordance with planned treatment.  
 It must be clear to you that the active treatment received by the patient is internally consistent and not simply a series of disconnected specific modalities delivered within certain scheduled intervals.  
 Survey Procedures §482.61(c)(1)(iii)  
 Are qualified staff observed following the methods, approaches and staff intervention as stated?  
 Can staff explain the focus of the modality they have provided?  
 Are observed treatment methods, approaches and interventions from all disciplines included in the plan?  
 
Do the pieces of the treatment plan work together to achieve the greatest possible gain for the patient?  
 Does the hospital integrate its activities, therapies, treatments, and patient routines to 
work for the patient’s therapeutic interest first, and its own convenience second?  
 
Do the disciplines present at observed treatment planning meetings represent all of the patient’s needs?  
 If the patient attends treatment planning, how do the staff prepare the patient to participate?  
 If the patient does not attend, what reasons do staff give to explain the absence?  
Is there a process to enable staff to reach a consensus regarding how treatment will be carried out?  
 Is the patient included in the decision- making, whenever possible?  
 Are the final decisions regarding treatment approaches defined clearly by the end of the discussion?   How does the patient get to know his/her treatment regime?  
 How does the treatment team encourage the patient to accept responsibility for engaging 
in the treatment regime, rather than accepting it passively?

 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(c)(1)(iv)  
 There are no “correct” number of staff who comprise the treatment team. The disciplines involved in the patient’s treatment depend upon the problems to be treated, the short -term 
and long- range goals and the treatment approaches and modalities used to achi eve the 
goals.  The intent of the regulation is to insure that each individual on the treatment team who is primarily responsible for ensuring compliance with particular aspects of the patient’s individualized treatment program is identified. Identification of the staff s hould be 
recorded in a manner that includes the name and discipline of the individual. If other professionals or paraprofessionals provide care, the facility has the latitude to decide the manner with which it will identify them on the treatment plan.  
 
The patient, as well as family/significant others, should be aware of the staff responsible 
for various aspects of treatment.

 §482.61(c)(2) The treatment received by the patient must be documented in such a way to assure that all active therapeutic efforts are included.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(c)(2)  
 Active treatment is an essential requirement for inpatient psychiatric care. Active treatment is a clinical process involving ongoing assessment, diagnosis, intervention, evaluation of care and treatment, and planning for discharge and aftercare, under the  
direction of a psychiatrist. The patient is in the hospital because it has been determined that the patient requires intensive, 24 hour, specialized psychiatric intervention that cannot be provided outside the psychiatric hospital. The medical record must  indicate that 
the hospital adheres to the patient’s right to be counseled about medication, its intended 
effects, and the potential side effects. If the patient requires, because of danger to self or others, a more restrictive environment, the hospital must indicate tha t the staff attempted 
to care for the patient in the least restrictive setting before progressing to a more restrictive setting.  
Through observation, look for evidence that each patient is receiving all the aspects of 
treatment to which the hospital has committed itself based upon his/her assessment, 
evaluation and plan of care. It is the hospital’s responsibility to provide those t reatment 
modalities with sufficient frequency and intensity to assure that the patient achieves his/her optimal level of functioning.  Through observation and interviews, look for evidence that each patient’s rights are being addressed and protected. There should be policies and procedures in place to address the following areas: informed consent, confidentiality, privacy, and security. E xpect to see 
detailed policies and procedures regarding the therapeutic use of restrictions, such as visitors, mail, and phone calls. Seclusion and restraint policies and procedures must address patient protection and safety while in a restricted setting.  Clarification of the types of notes found in the medical record.  
 Treatment notes are recordings in the medical record that indicate provision of, and a patient’s response to, a specific modality. This modality may be drug therapy, individual, family, marital, or group therapy, art therapy, recreational therapy, and any specialized therapy ordered by the physician or anyone credentialed by the facility, in accordance with the State law, to write orders in the medical record.  
 A combined treatment and progress note may be written.  Progress notes are recordings in the medical record that are written by persons directly responsible for the care and active treatment of the patient. Progress notes give a chronological picture of how the patient is progressing toward the accomplishment of the individual goals in the treatment plan. These are frequently shift notes, weekly notes, or monthly notes.  
 Survey Procedures §482.61(c)(2)  
 Does the patient know his/her diagnosis?  
 What did the patient contribute to the formulation of the treatment plan? Goals of treatment?  
 If the patient receives medication, does the patient understand the reason for the medication? The name of the medication? The dose prescribed? The time of administration? The desired effects? The potential side effects?  
 If medication is changed, is there a rationale for the change?  
 
Are staff members recording their observations relative to the patient’s response to the treatment modalities, including medication?  
 Is there evidence that the patient was afforded the opportunity to participate in his/her 
plan of care?  
 
What progress has the patient made? Has the patient achieved his/her optimal level of functioning? If not, why? Are these reasons/barriers reflected in the current treatment plan? Do treatment and progress notes support these insights?   Does the observed status of the patient in the various treatment modalities correspond to the progress note reports of status?  
 Do all treatment team members document their observations and interventions so that the information is available to the entire team?  
 If a restrictive procedure is used (e.g., restraint and/or seclusion), is there evidence that attempts were made systematically to treat the patient in the least restrictive manner?  
 Is there evidence that the rights of the patient were protected while in the restrictive setting in accordance with Federal and State law and accepted standards of practice?

Progress notes must be recorded by the physician(s), psychologists, or other licensed independent practitioner(s) responsible for the care of the patient as specified in §482.12(c); nurse, social worker and, when appropriate, others significantly involved in active treatment modalities.   Interpretive Guidelines §482.61(d)  
 Refer to §482.61(c)(2) Interpretive Guidelines for clarification between treatment notes and progress notes. The recording of progress is evidence of individual patient performance. Specifically, the progress notes recorded by the professional staff, or others responsible for the patient’s treatment, must give a chronological picture of the patient’s progress or lack of progress towards atta ining short and long- range goals outlined in the 
individual treatment plan. Progress notes should relate to the goals of the treatment plan. Notes that state, “patient slept well” or “no complaints” constitute observations and do not indicate how the patie nt is responding to treatment and progressing towards set goals. 
Frequency alone does not determine the adequacy of progress notes. Expect to see greater frequency when patients are more acutely ill and/or in a crisis of some kind. Notes should be dated an d signed (signature and title or discipline).

§482.62 Condition of Participation: Special Staff Requirements for 
Psychiatric Hospitals 
 
The hospital must have adequate numbers of qualified professional and supportive staff to evaluate patients, formulate written, individualized comprehensive treatment plans, provide active treatment measures and engage in discharge planning.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.62  
 The purpose of this Condition of Participation is to ensure that the psychiatric hospital is adequately staffed with qualified mental health professionals and supportive staff to carry out an intensive and comprehensive active treatment program and to prot ect and promote 
the physical and mental health of the patients.  
 Through observation, interview and record review determine if numbers and/or deployment of qualified staff is a concern. Review incident reports, medication error reports, patient and staff injury reports, for indications that staffing is an issue. 
 
Adequate numbers are defined to mean the numbers, and deployment, of staff with qualifications to evaluate, plan, implement and document active treatment.  
 Do not look at numbers alone. The hospital is responsible for organizing its available 
staff and administrative duties along with patient appointments, treatment plan meetings, 
treatment sessions, activities, materials, equipment and patient assignments to  wards and 
groups in such a way that results in patients achieving the maximum therapeutic benefit.  
 
Survey Procedure §482.62   Assess the adequacy of the Special Staffing Condition by:  
 1. Observing sampled patients and others during structured sessions and in unstructured settings. You should be able to observe behavioral evidence of a rational organization of resources.  
 
2. Next, interview patients and staff to determine whether or not necessary treatment modalities and other services are being provided in a timely manner.  
 3. Next review the medical records of patients in the sample to ascertain if necessary active treatment assessments, treatments, evaluations and activities have been conducted and documented.  
 4. Also, review other records such as restraint and seclusion records, incident reports, 
medication error reports, reports of patient/staff injuries, etc., to determine the extent to which staffing levels or deployment contributed to negative patient outcomes . 
 5. Evaluate all outcome data in light of the success or failure observed during the survey 
relevant to each patient receiving active treatment, and achieving desired outcomes of care. This is the primary basis for evaluating the adequacy of the hospital’s staffing under this Special Condition.

(3) Provide active treatment measures; and  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.62(a)(3)  
 Active treatment occurs when the patient receives treatment interventions that are delivered under the direction of a physician, and which are specific to patient strengths, 
disabilities, and problems identified in the treatment plan. Treatment interventions and 
other services are furnished in accordance with accepted standards of professional practice. Although the active treatment process must be identifiable in documentatio n, it 
must be first and foremost observable and evident in daily practice.  
 
Treatment interventions need to be individualized, in that the patient receives assistance 
with resolving or ameliorating the problems/circumstances that led to hospitalization. 
Expect to see treatment focused on the unique needs of individual patients. For example, several patients may be referred to “Anger Management Group,” but the focus of discussion and therapeutic intervention may differ depending on the individual patient’s particular issue regarding managing anger.  
 Whether structure must be imposed by staff or whether the patient can direct his or her own activities for periods of time (without staff supervision), is based on the patient’s ability to engage in constructive, appropriate behavior (without engaging in harm to self or others). Be certain that the patient’s time on the unit is maximized toward the further development of appropriate desired outcomes, including but not limited to leisure and recreation.  
 Survey Procedures §482.62(a)(3)  
 Through observation, interviews and record reviews, can you determine that patients receive active treatment?   Is the distribution of staff consistent with particular patient needs? Is appropriate staffing 
sufficient to carry out treatment plans?  
 Does the patient attend therapies that are relevant to the identified problems that brought the patient to the hospital?   Are staff absences and/or vacancies preventing the patient from receiving active treatment? Are patients not attending therapeutic activities off the unit because there is no staff to escort them? Are therapeutic groups not available on the unit for patients who are not able to go off the unit?  
 Are patients observed not engaged in activities while staff attend to administrative tasks?  
 Are active treatment sessions or activities carried out at discrete time intervals exclusively? Or is active treatment implemented as the patient’s needs emerge during the course of the day, as well?   Does a review of quality assurance data reveal a pattern of serious incidents occurring on particular shifts and/or days of the week?  
 What do patients report to the surveyor are their treatment modalities?  
 
Do patient interviews indicate that patients believe the treatment being provided is 
helpful?  
 Does the scheduling of activities and their content relate directly to the patient’s treatment objectives or are the activities/content generalized, non -therapeutic “time-
fillers”?  
 Can staff describe how their activities relate to the patient’s treatment objectives?   At any point in time, in any of the patient’s experiences in the hospital is the thrust of the patient’s treatment plan observable during the staff and/or patient interactions?   Is there a consistent, observable pattern of evidence that hospital staff provide, reinforce and otherwise implement measures to achieve active treatment objectives?

 §482.62(d)(2) . . .There must be adequate numbers of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and mental health workers to provide the nursing care necessary under each patient’s active treatment program.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.62(d)(2)  
 The evaluation of sufficient numbers and level of RNs, LPNs and mental health workers is based on the patient characteristics as seen in structured observations of patients in the sample and other patients in the hospital, patient interviews, and as evidenced in medical records and other data related to patients (e.g. incident reports, seclusion/restraint reports). Patient care assignments should be appropriate to the skills and qualifications of the nursing personnel providing patient care.  
 There should be evidence that all nursing personnel have education, experience and/or training in psychiatric care. Mental health workers spend the majority of their workday interacting with patients. Expect to see evidence that they are receiving on- going 
supervision and training. Mental health workers should be assigned patient care duties and therapeutic modalities that reflect their educational level, psychiatric training, and experience.  
 Survey Procedure §482.62(d)(2)  
 
The nursing staffing patterns should be reviewed on a sample of approximately 25% of 
the certified wards. The staffing, including levels of nursing personnel, should be reviewed for the day(s) of the survey and evaluated based on the level of needs present ed 
by the patients. Additional staffing patterns shall be reviewed if a problem or concern is evidenced. Decisions regarding extent of additional data (number of wards and dates) to 
be reviewed shall be based on the degree of problem/concern. Patient need 
assessment/patient acuity shall be reviewed for any wards as deemed necessary based on 
problems/concerns found in the sampling review.  
 If your observations and/or interviews indicate a staffing problem, you may want to consider the following variables in assessing adequacy of nursing personnel coverage:  
 1. Organization and types of services provided to patients by the nursing department;  
2. Number and levels of nursing care needs of patients, including average length of stay, acuity of patients and nursing care requirements;  3. Number and levels of nursing personnel based on the roles and functions required of nursing;  4. Number of suicidal/assaultive patients;  5. Seclusion/restraint incidents;  6.

 §482.62(f)  Standard: Social Services.  
 There must be a director of social services who monitors and evaluates the quality 
and appropriateness of social services furnished. The services must be furnished in accordance with accepted standards of practice and established policies and procedures.  
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.62(f)  
 Social work functions may include the following functions: Intake or admission screening, psychosocial assessment of a newly admitted patient; developing an update or detailed re -assessment of the patient; high -social risk case finding; contact with family  
and others significant in the patient’s life. Such functions may include patient and family 
education, support, and advocacy; providing coordination/liaison with community- based 
social and mental health agency(ies) regarding the pre -admission status of the patient; 
participating as a member of the treatment team in development of treatment planning 
and subsequent planned interventions (modalities). Such modalities may include supportive, individual, couple, family, or group therapy, aimed at meeting specified goals 
identified in the treatment plan.  
 
Continuity of care is an important social work principle and may be demonstrated through case management and a major role in discharge planning. Activities, in conjunction with the patient wishes, may include contact with patient’s family, identifying and assisting in referral of the patient to community -based agency(ies) at the 
time of discharge. Finally, post -discharge follow -up may be done to assure that linkage of 
the patient with community resources has occurred to reduce re -hospitalization.  
 Determine who completed the assessment required by §482.61(a)(4) and initiated preliminary discharge planning. When staff other than a Social Worker perform these duties, the Director of Social Work or a Master’s level social worker (MSW) qualified supervi sory staff member should be involved to oversee the quality and appropriateness 
of service provided.  
 Patient and staff interviews, structured observations and review of selected medical records yield the information necessary to determine how well social work has met the needs of the patients. The surveyor should evaluate these data to determine adequacy of qualified and support staff deployed to patient areas and their duties.  
The social work policies for service provision to the patient should describe: the organizational structure of the department (program) and the range of services performed by the department.  
 Survey Procedure §482.62(f)  
 Just prior to the end of the survey, schedule a meeting with the Director of Social Work. By the time of the meeting, you should already have conducted required observations, interviews and record reviews for at least a majority of the patients in the samp le. Collect 
any additional information that is necessary to consider in light of outcomes observed for patients, including: the qualifications of the director; the leadership exhibited for the scope of services needed by the patient; and the rationale for social work staffing coverage.  
 How does the director periodically audit the quality of social work services furnished?  
 What are the outcomes of audits conducted? What percentage of psychosocial assessments was completed and available in written form at the time of the interdisciplinary treatment plan? How does the patient’s social needs as addressed by the social worker in  the psychosocial assessment compare against the goals developed in the 
interdisciplinary treatment plan?  
Has social work staff provided active treatment in accordance with the patient’s treatment 
plan?  
 Accepted standards of practice are based on policy statements adopted by the National Association of Social Workers and a definition of social work practice in health care 
adapted by the Consortium of Health Care Social Work Organizations. Staff should 
adhere to the facility’s personnel requirements.

mechanisms for exchange of appropriate information with sources outside the hospita l. 
 Interpretive Guidelines §482.62(f)(2)  
Social work contact with the patient, family, and significant others should occur during, 
or as soon as possible, after the admission. High- risk case finding should result in 
significant data being available for early integration into the treatment plan an d 
subsequent social work action as indicated. The treatment team should consider, for possible inclusion into the patient’s treatment plan, the anticipated social work role and 
expected interventions as recommended in the psychosocial assessment . Treatmen t and 
discharge planning activities, liaison/follow -up efforts should be based upon the goals, 
including discharge goals, and staff responsibilities specified in the treatment plan. 
 Survey Procedures §482.62(f)(2)
