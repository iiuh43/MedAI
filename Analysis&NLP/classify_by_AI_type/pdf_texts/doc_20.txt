HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMO
RULES
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system–

and should be cited in this manner: 3 CSR 10-4.115.
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division in the department 
is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas 
called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraphs 1., subparagraphs A., parts (I), subparts (a), items I. and subitems a.
The rule is properly cited by using the full citation; for example, 3 CSR 10-4.115, NOT Rule 10-4.115.
 
Citations of RSMo are to the Missouri Revised Statutes as of the date indicated.

Proposed Amendment Text Reminder:
Boldface text indicates new matter.[Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.]MISSOURI
REGISTER
T he text of proposed rules and changes will appear under this heading. A notice of proposed rulemaking is required 
to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This explanation is set out in the purpose section of each rule. A citation of the 
legal authority to make rules is also required, and appears following the text of the rule, after the word  “Authority.”
Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbology under the heading of proposed rule. If an 
existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules that are proposed to be amended will have new matter 
printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in 
brackets.
An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit and encourage public participation in the rulemaking 
process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may 
take different forms.
If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public 
Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned 
or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit 
Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even 
 though not required by law to hold one. If an 
agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close-of-comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking.
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice, file a new notice 
of proposed rulemaking, and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.TITLE  10—DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES

Substance Use Disorder Grant  Program Awards 
 The number of awards that will be made is unknown; however, the program intends to award all appropriated funding in year one for a total of $5,848,619.  However, the amount of funding awarded in years two and beyond is anticipated to be at least 
$5,848,619 plus any additional funding appropriated from the  Missouri Veterans, Health, 
and Community Reinvestment Fund from taxes and fees on non- medical cannabis retail 
sales . 
 
IV. ASSUMPTIONS  
 In order to process the applications and  the application review described in this rule, the 
department will need  two FTEs to adequately administer the program as Public Health 
Program Specialists and one FTE as a Senior Research Analyst.    
 The two Public Health Program Specialists will be responsible for the following duties: developing the notice of grant opportunities, monitoring, conducting training, and providing technical assistance to grant recipients.  The Senior Research Analyst will be responsible for conducting cannabis surveillance, collecting , and analyzing program- related data, evaluating the program , and developing 
data dashboards to share program impact.  
 DHSS currently has one Public Health Specialist FTE allocated to administer the SUD Grant Program. However, the number of FTEs and the cost of administering the grant program exceed what DHSS has available. DHSS needs additional funding and two FTEs to adequately administer the program.  The Department anticipates an increase in the amount of funding available for SUD Grant Program awards in years two and beyond due to an increase in funding from the Missouri Veterans, Health, and Community Reinvestment Fund from taxes and fees on non-medical cannabis retail sales , which may increase the annual cost to comply with the 
rules.

 Initial application for licensure:  
  All processing and form development will be absorbed into DHSS workload. No additional FTE required  or expense anticipated . 
 Post licensing sanitation inspection  will be absorbed into the DHSS workload. No additional 
FTE required  or expense anticipated .

Variance request process:  
 
Variance requests will be absorbed into the existing DHSS workload. No additional FTE required  or expense anticipated . 
 IV. Assumptions:  The Department assumes that 2 -6 facilities will require licensure as a Prescribed Pediatric 
Extended Care (PPEC) facility.  Two facilities are already providing services that will require licensure as of August 28, 2025.  The Registered Nurse ( RN) FTE requires supervision by a Regulatory Compliance Manager 
who will perform other duties not covered by this proposed rule. This is an existing position 
and duties will be absorbed into existing workload; therefore, no additional expenses will be incurred.  Program -related information technology needs will be absorbed into current DHSS software 
systems.

 IV. ASSUMPTIONS:  
 
1. The department is estimating a maximum number of six (6) PPEC facilities in 
Missouri.  There are currently two (2) facilities in Missouri who are already providing 
the type of care that will require licensure as a PPEC facility.  
 Policies  
 
1. Child care facility director hourly wage was derived from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and ZipRecruiter information for Preschool and Childcare Center Directors. This particular job classification was not available through the Missouri Department of Labor.  
2. It is assumed that the multidisciplinary teams represented in the policy development meetings will be PT and OT as these services are general provided on a full time basis. While some facilities may also contract for speech therapy or nutrition services, these are likely to be sporadic due to low demand. Wages for these specialties are all noted below in Facility Staffing.  
3. Assumed physician or allowed practitioner consulting fee range was based on discussion with DHSS Chief Medical Officer and stakeholders who had existing relationships with pediatric physicians. It is assumed that a non- physician allowed 
practitioner would charge less for consulting than a physician, but this does not impact the range since some stakeholders reported an expectation that some physicians / 
Missouri  registerFebruary 3, 2025
V ol. 50, No. 3Page 181
allowed practitioners may serve in this role pro bono. Note that allowed practitioners 
are only allowed to conduct the annual review of policies.  
 Minimum Required Medical Supplies  
 
1. The rule does not specify which supplies need to be on- hand at the facility since this 
will vary based on the needs of children in care. The supplies listed in this section of the fiscal note make up staple supplies that we anticipate all facilities will choose to have on hand.  
Facility Staffing  
 
1. The healthcare staff salary/cost, including RN, PT, OT, SLP, RD,  LPN, CNA, and 
CMT, are based on the US Bureau of Labor Statistics for Missouri and actual job postings for pediatric nurses in Missouri. 
2. The Director of Nursing (DON) and Qualified Designee are assumed to have a higher salary than other Registered Nurses (RNs) working at the facility due to having more experience in pediatric nursing and higher levels of daily responsibility.  
3. Salary calculations in this section are based on hourly rate times 40 hours per week times 48 working weeks per year ($$ x 40 x 48).  
4. The 20% fringe and benefits rate is based on discussions with stakeholders that are planning to operate licensed PPEC facilities. This includes paid time off and insurance.  
5. The staffing cost range for facilities with 1 eligible child in attendance assumes the following: 
a. The RN present will be the DON. Full time staffing is assumed for the DON.  
b. The facility must also employ a Qualified Designee, who will make up to the same amount annually as the DON, depending whether the PPEC chooses to employe this person full-time or on a PRN basis.  
6. The staffing cost range for facilities with 2 -6 eligible children in attendance assumes 
the following: 
a. The RN present will be the DON. Full time staffing is assumed for the DON.  
b. The low end of this estimate assumes the additional skilled nursing staff present is an LPN working full time. This could also be a combination of a part-time LPN and part- time Qualified Designee.  
c. The high end of this estimate assumes the additional skilled nursing staff present is the Qualified Designee, working full time.   
7. The staffing cost ranges for facilities with 7 -12 eligible children in attendance assumes 
the following:  
a. The RN present will be the DON. Full time staffing is assumed for the DON.  
b. The low end of these estimates also assumes the additional skilled nursing staff present is an LPN working full time. This could also be a combination of a part-time LPN and part- time Qualified Designee. The direct care staff present 
are CNAs, working full- time.  
c. The high end of this estimate also assumes the additional skilled nursing staff present is the Qualified Designee, working full time.  The direct care staff present are CMTs, working full- time.  
8. The staffing cost ranges for facilities with 13 -24 eligible children in attendance 
assume the following: 
ProPosed  rulesFebruary 3, 2025
V ol. 50, No. 3Page 182
a. The two RNs present will be the DON and Qualified Designee, both working 
full time.  
b. The low end of these estimates also assumes the additional skilled nursing staff present will be LPNs and the direct care staff will be CNAs, all working full time.  
c. The high end of these estimate also assumes the additional skilled nursing staff present will be RNs and the direct care staff will be CMTs, all working full time.  
9. The staffing cost ranges for facilities with 25 -36 eligible children in attendance 
assume the following: 
a. The three RNs present will be the DON, the Qualified Designee, and a lesser -
qualified RN, all working full time.  
b. The low end of these estimates also assumes the additional skilled nursing staff present will be LPNs and the direct care staff will be CNAs, all working full time.  
c. The high end of these estimate also assumes the additional skilled nursing staff present will be RNs and the direct care staff will be CMTs, all working full time.  
10. The basic life support costs assume the following: 
a. The minimum cost assumes two (2) PPEC staff members – the DON and Qualified Designee – and no turnover, meaning certification is only required every other year for both staff members. 
b. The maximum cost assumes twelve (12) PPEC staff member (based on staffing requirements for a facility with up to 36 eligible children in care) and 100% turnover annually, meaning certification is required for all 12 staff members annually.  
11. The background screening cost assumes the following:  
a. The minimum cost assumes two (2) PPEC staff members – the DON and Qualified Designee – and no turnover, meaning screening is only required every five years for both staff members.  
b. The maximum cost assumes twelve (12) PPEC staff member (based on staffing requirements for a facility with up to 36 eligible children in care) and 100% turnover annually, meaning screening is required for all 12 staff members annually.  
 Employee Files  
 
1. Costs listed are for those supplies minimally needed to compile employee files for PPEC staff members.  
2. Additional supplies, such as computers, printers, ink and toner, are assumed to be shared with the child care facility and will already be available as needed. Because the additional use is assumed to be nominal, no additional cost for these items is included.  
3. No staff time for compiling or maintaining employee files is included because this would be part of the standard duties of the Director of Nursing (DON), whose salary is already considered above.  
 
Staff Training  
 
Missouri  registerFebruary 3, 2025
V ol. 50, No. 3Page 183
1. All estimates in this session assume there is an added cost for training; however it is 
possible that the minimum cost for these activities is $0 if this time can be included in time paid under regular salaries.  
2. Estimates for this section do not include trainings otherwise required by DESE.  
 Infection Control  
 
1. No additional cost is included for hand washing sinks, antimicrobial soap, disposable paper towels, sinks, sanitary towels, hand drying devices providing heated air, bed linens, laundry facilities, or laundry supplies because the facility is already required by DESE to have an adequate supply of these items. Costs in this section include only those items not otherwise required by DESE or which may require additional supply due to the unique needs of the PPEC facility.  
2. Costs in this section are based on the 2024 Grainger Safety Solutions Catalog and cost estimates received from stakeholders who are planning operate PPEC facilities.  
 Equipment  
 
1. No cost is assumed for medical equipment or the inspection/maintenance of medical equipment on an annual basis or per manufacturer’s specifications because equipment is provided by each individual child’s medical supply company and that company is already expected to meet these maintenance requirements.  
 Medications  
 
1. The PPEC facility will not stock any of its own medications. All necessary medication must be supplied by the eligible child’s parent or guardian.  
 Clinical Records  
 
1. Assumed cost of $100/enrolled child per year was gained from conversations with stakeholders that plan to operate licensed Prescribed Pediatric Extended Care facilities.  
 Quality Assurance  
1. Estimates in this section do not include this once annual physician or authorized practitioner consultant, as that cost is already accounted for in the policy section.  
 Fire and Emergency Procedures  
1. Estimates in this section were obtained from discussion with stakeholders who are actively planning to operate licensed PPEC facilities.  
 Other  
1. The building construction, physical plant, and basic equipment and supply requirements are assumed to be met based on the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE)’s regulations for licensure of child care facilities.  
ProPosed  rulesFebruary 3, 2025
V ol. 50, No. 3Page 184
2. Eligible children are already under the care of at least one (1) primary care physician 
due to the severity of their conditions. No additional cost is included for physician consultation based on the assumption that this is part of their routine care.  
3. Additional room cost and essential electrical system upgrades were based on actual construction costs provided by Special Learning Center in Jefferson City, MO.

 III. WORKSHEET  
Costs for hospitals not using DHSS training   
Training costs:  (85 hospitals x .1) x (4 nurses + 4 prescribers per hospital) x ($600 for 
training costs) = $40,800  Nurse salary and fringe:  (85 hospitals x .1) x (4 nurses per hospital ) x (($39 per hour 
per nurse salary ) + (9.75 per hour per nurse estimated fringe benefit s)) x (8 hours of 
training ) = $13,260 
 Prescriber salary and fringe: (85 hospitals x .1) x (4 prescribers /hospital) x ( ($64 per 
hour per prescriber  salary ) + ($16 per hour per prescriber estimated fringe benefits)) x (2 
hours of training ) = $5,440 
 Total Cost = $59,500  There are 85 hospitals that will be required to participate. Each hospital will need at least four nurses and four prescribers, one nurse and prescriber for each of the main four shifts, day shift weekdays, day shift weekends, night shift weekdays, night

shift weekends. DHSS staff estimate only 10 percent of hospitals will not use the 
DHSS provided trainings. This estimate was established after communicating with hub sites and satellite sites across the state. If not using the free DHSS training, the hospitals will need to pay for a different training option. National trainings cost on average $600 per person. The training units take an average of 8 hours for nursing staff and 2 hours for prescriber staff. The length of the training was identified by reviewing existing training options and the proposed training requirements to establish how long it will take to train staff on the required elements.   DHSS staff estimated the cost per hour for nursing staff time by using the average salary of $39 per hour.  The prescriber cost per hour was similarly calculated by 
averaging physician assistant, nurse practitioner, and physician salaries, about $64 per hour.   
 Fringe costs for nurses were estimated at about $20,280 per FTE divided by an average of 2,080 hours each year, about $9.75 per hour per nurse. Fringe costs for prescribers were estimated at about $32,260 per FTE divided by an average of 2,080 hours each year, about $16 per hour per provider.  Costs for hospitals using DHSS training  
Nurse salary and fringe:  (85 hospitals x .9) x (4 nurses per hospital) x (($39 per hour 
per nurse salary) + (9.75 per hour per nurse estimated fringe benefits)) x (8 hours of 
training) = $119,340  Prescriber salary and fringe:  (85 hospitals x .9) x (4 prescribers/hospital) x (($64 per 
hour per prescriber salary) + ($16 per hour per prescriber estimated fringe benefits)) x (2 hours of training) = $48,960 Total Cost=$168,300  There are 85 ho spitals that will be required to participate. Each hospital will need at 
least four nurses and four prescribers, one nurse and prescriber for each of the main four shifts, day shift weekdays, day shift weekends, night shift weekdays, night shift weekends. DHSS staff estimate 90 percent of hospitals will use the DHSS provided trainings. This estimate was established after communicating with hub sites and satellite sites across the state.    DHSS staff estimated the cost per hour for nursing staff time by using the average salary of $39 per hour. The prescriber cost per hour was similarly calculated by averaging physician assistant, nurse practitioner, and physician salaries, about $64 per hour.   Fringe costs for nurses were estimated at about $20,280 per FTE divided by an average of 2,080 hours each year, about $9.75 per hour per nurse.

IV. ASSUMPTIONS  
It is estimated that 10 percent of hospitals in Missouri will not use the training provided by DHSS and will instead use training offered by a different entity. Training costs were estimated using national training costs from the International Association of Forensic Nurses. https://www.forensicnurses.org/page/OLCAccess/#sanetraining  
It is estimated to take approximately 8 hours for nurses and 2 hours for prescribers to complete the training.  
85 hospitals have emergency departments and will participate in the SAFEvT network. 
Only hospitals with emergency rooms were included in this fiscal note. These are the primary location for victims to receive care. Victims receiving a forensic exam have experienced an assault in the last five days. All victims will be transferred to a higher level of care (a hospital with an emergency room) to conduct a medical exam. It is not anticipated that a survivor would choose to have a forensic exam in one location and a medical exam in another. The number of hospitals is not all hospitals in Missouri. The remaining hospitals are not included because they do not have staff available 24/7 to perform urgent medical exams at all times.

language pathology assistant must include a statement from a speech-language pathologist holding current, unrestricted licensure to practice in the state of Missouri pursuant to section 345.015(10), RSMo, acknowledging acceptance of the legal and ethical responsibilities for supervising the assistant. A speech-language pathologist practicing with a provisional license pursuant to section [345.022] 345.021, RSMo, shall not 
be the supervisor for a speech-language pathology assistant.
[(4) The supervising speech-language pathologist shall provide

(5) The supervising speech-language pathologist shall provide 
written direction for continuing education activities to ensure that the speech-language pathology assistant’s practices are 
current and skills are maintained. Such information shall be 
maintained by the supervisor and assistant for a period of eight (8) years.]

supervising speech-language pathologist shall provide 
ongoing direct supervision [shall be provided for] to each 
assistant [supervised]  a minimum of [one (1) hour per week 
or one (1) out of every three (3) sessions]  once every sixty 
(60) days for each patient/client/student. Direct supervision is 
defined as real-time observing and viewing the assistant and patient/client/student when the treatment is being provided; direct supervision may be either in-person or through appropriate remote methods. If an alternative arrangement is necessary, the supervising speech-language pathologist 
must submit a proposed plan of supervision for the review 
of the advisory commission and board to determine if the supervision plan is acceptable. Supervision shall be distributed across the patient/client/student caseload as appropriate to ensure adequate oversight.

support to the assistant at all times, which can include but is not limited to[,]  telephone, facsimile, or other electronic 
communication; face-to-face communication; or other appropriate communication means. If the supervising speech-language pathologist is temporarily unavailable, a qualified speech-language pathologist alternate may be designated to meet this requirement. Written communication shall be provided by the supervising speech-language pathologist to 
the assistant that identifies the alternate and the period of 
temporary supervision.
[(8)](6) The supervising speech-language pathologist shall 
review and sign all patient/client/student documented progress notes written by the speech-language pathology assistant.
[(9)](7) The supervising speech-language pathologist shall 
assign and the assistant shall accept only those duties and responsibilities for which the assistant has been specifically 
trained and is qualified to perform, pursuant to the judg [e]-
ment of the supervising speech-language pathologist, and in 
compliance with the provisions of Chapter 345, RSMo.
[(10)] (8) The speech-language pathology assistant shall 
maintain supervisory logs and the speech-language 
pathologist shall sign verifying the hours of supervision per month[,] ; such logs shall be made available to the board 
within thirty (30) days upon receipt of a request for such logs from the board.
[(11)](9) The maximum number of speech-language pathology 
assistants supervised by one (1) speech-language pathologist shall not exceed three (3) at one (1) time.

on September 3, 2024 (49 MoReg 1345-1346). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code 
of State Regulations.
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The division received three (3) comments on the proposed amendment.
COMMENT #1: Charles Smarr, with Brydon, Swearengen & 
England, P.C., suggested we not start (18)(A) as “…an entity can’t be granted a license if “any” of its owners/members lack good moral character…” due to concern that 100% of the owners/members would be evaluated for good moral character and the concern over conflict with section 311.060.2, RSMo.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The language has 
been amended to clarify that good moral character evaluation 
is subject to the restrictions of sections 311.060.1-2, RSMo.
COMMENT #2: Richard Bryant, with Richard T. Bryant & 
Associates PC, noted the subsection identified as (A), but is consistent with 11 CSR 70-2.020(18)(B), should refer to the 5% level found in section (5) of the same regulation.

subsection (18)(B) are held to, whether it be for prior revocation 
history, or good moral character.
COMMENT #3: Tyler Rudd, with the Wine Institute, indicated 
the proposed language in (18)(A), as written, appeared to broaden the scope of statute with ambiguous language and 
a reference to “all” rather than “excess of 10%.” He further 
suggested that subsection (18)(B) raises some difficulties with entities that are trusts or have trusts as owners, indicating the proposed language is ambiguous in its meaning and scope. He 
also commented that this appears to disregard the purpose and 
structure of a corporate form and looks behind the corporate veil. He again questions the ambiguity of the language and suggests “excess of 10%” be added to (18)(B). Finally, in section (20), he indicated he would like the wording “in excess of 10%” added and asked for clarification on the attestation referenced in subsection (20)(A). He requested that subsection (20)(C) be deleted stating that trust instruments are confidential.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The language in 
subsection (18)(A) has been amended, which should resolve any confusion on what threshold of review individuals in subsections (A) and (B) are held to. Further, subsection (B) has also been amended to clarify the intent for trusts. With regard to 
piercing the corporate veil, ATC interprets section 311.060.2(1), 
RSMo, to do just that. With regard to the comments on section (20), we feel the amended language in subsections (18)(A) and (B) clarify who is evaluated. Alternatively, the existing 11 CSR 70-2.020(5) also provides clarification on when disclosures are required. The attestation in question is currently available on our website under Other Licensing Forms. We do not agree that subsection (20)(C) should be deleted as the evaluation of the trust document would only be upon request, as needed.
11 CSR 70-2.020 Application for License
(18) When evaluating the qualifications for licensure of any 
business entity not specifically named in section 311.060, RSMo, the division shall use the standards set forth in this section. 
(A) No entity shall be granted a liquor license if any of its 
owners, members, natural persons holding a financial interest in the business sought to be licensed, officers, or managing officer have held any such a position with a revoked license, subject to the limitations described in section 311.060.7, RSMo, or if such individual shall not be a person of good moral character subject to the limitations described in section 311.060.1-2, RSMo. As used in this subsection, “members” shall refer to natural persons holding a share of control of the 
business sought to be licensed. 
(B) When a business seeking to be licensed has ownership 
held by a separate business entity or trust, all natural persons 
associated with the ownership or control of the trust shall be 
evaluated consistent with subsection (18)(A) as though the 
natural persons associated with the shareholding business were members of the business sought to be licensed.

COMMENT: Charles Smarr, with Brydon, Swearengen &

RESPONSE: When referencing an outside law or rule, the 
specific rule as well as the publish date must be referenced, so we can’t incorporate “any revised regulations” after said date. We will amend the regulation as necessary to incorporate revised rules. No changes were made as a result of this comment.

becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The division received two (2) 
comments on the proposed amendment.
COMMENT #1: Charles Smarr, with Brydon, Swearengen & 
England, P.C., suggested the proposed regulation requires self-
incrimination and/or production of records without a search warrant. Further, he noted there was no end date.
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The language was 
amended to discern the type of activity for which records must be maintained, a time frame for such records to be maintained, and to address the concern for self-incrimination. Licensees are already required to report illegal or violent activity that occurs on or about the licensed premises to law enforcement, and to cooperate with law enforcement authorities and agents of the division. Nothing in this regulation should be construed to remove the requirement for a warrant, if applicable.
COMMENT #2: Richard Bryant, with Richard T. Bryant & 
Associates PC, noted that the amendment should be expanded to include “criminal activity occurring on or about the premises.”
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The language was 
amended to discern the type of activity for which records must be maintained, and a time frame for such records to be maintained, but did not expand it.
11 CSR 70-2.140 All Licensees
(6) All licensees shall keep complete and accurate records 
pertaining to their businesses. Such records include a complete and accurate record of all purchases and of all sales of intoxicating liquor made by them. These records are to include the names and addresses of all persons from whom the liquor is purchased, the dates, kinds, and quantities of the purchases and the dates and amounts of payments on account. They also should include the daily gross returns from sales. 
(D) If a licensee maintains additional records not required 
by this section, such as audio, video, telephonic, written, or otherwise transcribed records, the licensee shall maintain complete and accurate records relevant to acts that are subject to administrative action against liquor licenses for a period of fifteen (15) business days, or until those records are turned over 
to the supervisor of alcohol and tobacco control or other law 
enforcement agency with competent jurisdiction, whichever is sooner. The duty to maintain such records begins when the 
licensee knows or should know that such an act has occurred 
on the licensed premise, or has been notified by the supervisor of alcohol and tobacco control or any other law enforcement agency that there is a pending investigation regarding the licensee’s conduct.

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The division received one (1) 
comment on the proposed amendment.
COMMENT: Tyler Rudd, with the Wine Institute, requests that 
the proposed language be removed because wholesalers have been registering lines and brands for decades in Missouri and other states. 
RESPONSE: This amendment does not change the current 
practice. Wholesalers do not currently register brands, the suppliers do. It was recognized that the language in the existing rule does not clearly identify the current practices, so we cleaned up the language. This regulation does not make any changes to the way brands are currently registered, and for that reason the division is not making any changes.
