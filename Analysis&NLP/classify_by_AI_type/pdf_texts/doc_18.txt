The Health and Physical Education Quality Teaching Network (HPE QTN) 
District Health Education Standards and Benchmark Model  
The HPE QTN is made up of 50 master health educatio n and physical education K-12 and higher education teachers across Minnesota. The HPE QTN provides ser vice 
work for districts in a multitude of capacities fro m resource development, research projects, and in-s ervice trainings. The Benchmarking Project is a HPE  QTN collective 
effort to assist schools as they review local stand ards. They are not the state official model as legi slation requires districts to develop their own how ever; they can be 
utilized in part, or as a whole, for districts as t hey go through their review process. They can be us ed by classroom teachers, curriculum developers or curriculum review 
teams. For further information, contact
