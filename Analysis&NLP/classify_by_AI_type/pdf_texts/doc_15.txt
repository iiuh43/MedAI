Report of the Director  
National Institutes of Health  
Fiscal Years 2010 & 2011  
  
 
  

 2 Preface    
This is the third National Institutes of Health ( NIH) Biennial Report submitted under the requirement 
established by Section 104 of the NIH Reform Act (Pub. L. No. 109 -482).  Appendix A provides the 
language in the Reform Act that is relevant to this report, along with the language of two subsequent 
laws that  supplement the provisions of the Reform Act —the Food and Drug Administration 
Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. No. 110 -85) and the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007 (Pub. 
L. No. 110 -204).  NIH’s goal is for  the information in this report  to serve as a useful reference for 
understanding NIH activities and operations and welcomes feedback on the report.  
Chapter Organization  
Chapter 1  opens with a statement from the Director of the NIH providing an assessment of the state of 
biomedical and behavioral research.  It then describes  NIH structure, policies, and procedures focusing 
on the operations of the extramural and intramural research programs, mechanisms for strategic 
planning (including the activities and processes of the Division of Program Coordination, Planning and 
Strategic Initiatives, and its management of the Common Fund), and various cross -cutting activities not 
covered in the  chapters that follow, such as programs that provide the platform for discovery , including 
training and career development activities, and science literacy efforts .  
Chapter 2  provides an overview of the NIH research portfolio.  The topics covered include:  
 Identifying Public Health Needs  – Epidemiology  
 Basic Research  
 Preclinical Translational Research  
 Clinical Research  
 Postclinical Translational Research  
 Information at the Service of Health  
 Research Technology  
The chapter begins with a brief introduction that describes the full continuum of biomedical research at 
NIH.  The research continuum begins with basic research, moves onto early or preclinical translational 
research, then goes into clinical research, proceeds to translational research, and ends with clinical and 
community practice.  The path in the continuum is not strictly linear, because all steps of biomedical 
research can inform  and relate to  other areas.   
The introduction is followed by a summary of the NIH research portfolio across all of the Institutes and 
Centers (ICs) and Office of the Director (OD) program offices.  Specific examples are included i n the 
summary, illustrating how NIH research at each st age of the continuum augments human knowledge 
 3 and improves public health.  Chapter 2 also de scribes how NIH ensures the uptake of research results by 
clinical practitioners and the public.  Effective communication activities are another important facet of 
NIH’s mission.  Targeted health communication plans and information campaigns that provide sci ence -
based information are essential to improving people’s health and saving lives.  Chapter 2 concludes with 
NIH-funded research technologies, which provide innovative tools that are used within multiple steps in 
the continuum and often provide the means f or an exchange of information.  
Chapter 3  addresses NIH research activities from the perspective of diseases, disorders, and adverse 
health conditions.  The topics covered include:  
 Cancer  
 Neuroscience and Disorders of the Nervous System  
 Life Stages, Human  Development, and Rehabilitation  
 Chronic Diseases and Organ Systems  
 Autoimmune Diseases  
 Infectious Diseases and Biodefense  
 Minority Health and Health Disparities  
These topics, all categories specified in the NIH Reform Act of 2006 (see Appendix A), ar e grouped 
together in one chapter to address the intent of the statute, in terms of presenting information on 
diseases, disorders, and adverse health conditions in a standardized format.  Each topic is addressed in a 
separate section.   
Chapter 4  addresses c ertain NIH Centers of Excellence.  Overall, NIH Centers of Excellence are diverse in 
focus, scope, and origin.  The NIH Centers of Excellence described in this report are a subset —those 
established by statutory mandate.  This chapter provides overviews, progr ess reports for the fiscal year 
(FY) 2010 and 2011 biennial period (covering programmatic and research activities and outcomes), 
recommendations, evaluation plans, and future directions for the six congressionally mandated NIH 
Centers of Excellence program s, which are described in the order of their establishment:  
 Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (1984)  
 Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Centers of Excellence (1989)  
 Senator Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Centers (2001)  
 National Institute  on Minority Health and Health Disparities Centers of Excellence (2001)  
 Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (2003)  
 Autism Centers of Excellence (2006)

About NIH  
Statement of the Director   
It is my honor to present to Congress the Biennial Report of the Director of the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) for Fiscal Years (FY s) 2010 and 2011.  Thanks to the ongoing  support of Congress, NIH 
continues the discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and 
the application of  that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.  
NIH has been the driving force behind decades of advances that have improved the health of people 
across the United States and around the world.  
Remarkable Contributio ns 
For 125 years, NIH has been at the forefront of medical research, directing critical funding to research 
institutions in cities, regions, and states throughout the nation and the world and stimulating lifesaving 
research breakthroughs.  Begun as a one-room Laboratory of Hygiene in 1887, NIH today has grown into 
a complex and multidisciplinary engine for discovery and innovation, compris ing 27 different Institutes 
and Centers (ICs).   
NIH research advances have prompted a revolution in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 
disease.  Thanks to discoveries funded through NIH appropriations, NIH -supporte d research has met 
some of our N ation’s biggest health challenges.  U.S. life expectancy has increased dramatically over the 
past century and continue s to improve, gaining about one year of longevity every six years since 1990.  A 
baby born today can look forward to an average life span of over  78 years, almost three decades longer 
than a baby born in 1900.1  
We have made impressive gains against cardiov ascular disease.  In the mid -20th century, cardiovascular 
disease caused half of U.S. deaths, claiming the lives of many people still in their 50s or 60s.2 Between 
1968 and 2008, deaths due to both coronary heart disease and stroke decreased by approximatel y 75 
percent,3 and these mortality rates continue to decline.4 NIH-supported research led to minimally 
invasive techniques to prevent heart attacks and to highly effective drugs to lower cholesterol, control 
high blood pressure, and break up artery -cloggin g blood clots.  NIH-funded interventions have  also 
motivated  people to make lifestyle changes that promote health, such as eating less fat, exercising 
more, and quitting smoking . These and other factors have contributed to significant health 
improvements fo r Americans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the

4 National Vital Statistic Reports, Volume 61,Number 4 October 10, 2012. Deaths: Preliminary Data for 2011.  
 8 age-adjusted risk of death decreased by over 60 percent from 1935 to 201 1, and h eart disease and 
cancer , which accounted for 60 percent  of all deaths at their peak in 1983,  have dropped to 47  percent  
in 201 1.5 
Many chronic conditions begin as part of the aging process.  One such disease, osteoporosis, can result in 
life-threatening bone fractures among older people.  NIH-funded research has led to new medications 
and managemen t strategies for osteoporosis that have reduced the hospitalization rate for hip fractures 
by 16 percent since 1993.6 Science has also transformed the outlook for people with age -related 
macular degeneration, a major cause of vision loss among the elderly.  Twenty years ago, we could do 
little to prevent or treat this disorder.  Today, because of new treatments and procedures based in part 
on NIH research, 1.3 million Americans at risk for severe vision loss over the next five years now can 
receive potentiall y sight -saving therapies.7 
Biomedical research also has benefitted those at the beginning of life.  NIH-funded research has given 
hearing to thousands of children who were born profoundly deaf.  Their hearing is made possible with a 
cochlear implant, an elec tronic device that mimics the function of cells in the inner ear.  The U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) approved cochlear implants for pediatric use in 2000 . According to the 
FDA (as of December 2010) , more than 28,400 children in the U.S. have recei ved the devices, enabling 
many to develop normal language skills and succeed in mainstream classrooms.8 
One of NIH’s greatest achievements over the past 30 years has been to lead the global research effort 
against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
pandemic.  Building discovery upon discovery, researchers first achieved fundamental insights about how 
HIV works, and then went on to develop rapid HIV tests, identify a new class of HIV -fighting drugs, and, 
ultimately, figure out how to combine those drugs in life -saving ways.  A recent study estimated that 
14.4 million li fe-years have been gained among adults around the world since 1995 as a result of AIDS 
therapies developed through NIH funded research.9 In addition to encouraging progress on an HIV 
vaccine, NIH has also led groundbreaking research on using HIV therapies to prevent new infections in 
uninfected individuals at high risk of infection, such that we can now envision an AIDS -Free Generation.   
An Ec onomic Engine  
NIH has propelled research advances for the last 60 years by supporting a robust academic community 
that generates biomedical knowledge, patentable inventions, and trained scientists, including over 130 
NIH-funded Nobel Laureates.  NIH funding supports research personnel at more than 2,600  institutions  
that are located in all 50 states, the territories, and more than 90 countries around the world.

 9 Investing in NIH not only improves America’s health and strengthens our nation’s biome dical research 
potential, it propels the U.S. economy.  According to United for Medical Research’s report “An Economic 
Engine: NIH Research, Employment, and the Future of the Medical Innovation Sector,” the $23.7 billion 
NIH spent extramurally in the U.S. i n 2011 directly and indirectly supported 432,092 jobs, enabling 16 
states to experience job growth of 10,000 jobs or more, propelling $62.135 billion in new economic 
activity.10 
NIH funding is the foundation for long -term U.S. global competitiveness in indu stries such as 
biotechnology, medical devices, and pharmaceutical development.  Innovation in biomedical research in 
a knowledge -based world economy has the demonstrable capacity to generate growth, high -quality 
jobs, better health, and better quality of life for all Americans.  Investments in the biomedical research 
infrastructure, in scientists’ ideas, and in workforce training spur innovation that will drive 
America’s  future growth.   
Unprecedented Opportunities  
This is an extraordinarily exciting time to  be at NIH as we witness a rapidly accelerating understanding of 
basic biological mechanisms that will lead to revolutionary new approaches to treat and prevent 
disease.  This understanding is due in large part to technological advances that are changing ou r 
approach to science.  In the past, most basic science projects in biomedicine required investigators to 
limit the scope of their studies to some single aspect of cell biology or physiology.  The revolution now 
sweeping the field is the ability to be compre hensive : to define all the genes of a single human, or 
rapidly uncover all the human proteins and their structures.  We need look no further than the cost of 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA ) sequencing to see this dynamic at work.  The cost curve for sequencing is 
dropping at a breathtaking rate; sequencing speed has increased even faster than computer processing 
speed.  What’s more, the average fully loaded cost of sequencing an entire genome has fallen from 
about $ 61 million a decade  ago, to $ 7 million five year s ago, to about $ 6,500 today.  Lower sequencing 
costs will likely revolutionize how clinicians diagnose and treat diseases and enable the research 
community to pursue previously unimaginable scientific questions.  
NIH is the leading supporter of basic biome dical research in the world.  Our investments in basic 
biomedical and behavioral research make it possible to more accurately characterize the causes of 
disease onset and progression, design preventive interventions, develop better diagnostic tests, and 
discover new treatments and cures.  From the incremental advances in our understanding of a given 
disease to the groundbreaking discoveries that revolutionize our approaches for treating or preventing 
it, investments in basic research have yielded inestimable rewards and benefits to public health.  
Fostering a broad basic research portfolio is a critical component of fulfilling the NIH mission, and with 
the pace of discovery brought about by technological advances, we can anticipate an era of ever -
expanding unde rstanding of the fundamental mechanisms of life.

 10 Just as important to our mission is the translation of basic biological discoveries into clinical applications 
that can benefit all.  Translational research is a complex process that involves a series of int ricate steps.  
These steps range from the discovery of basic information about the causes of disease ; an assessment of 
whether that information has the potential to lead to a clinical advance ; the development and 
optimization of therapeutics to test in huma n trials ; and, ultimately, the application of the approved 
therapy, device, or diagnostic in the real world.  Drugs exist for only about 250 of the more than 4,400 
conditions with defined molecular causes.  And it takes far too long and far too much money to  get a 
new drug into our medicine cabinets.  This is an old problem that cries out for new and creative 
solutions.  
In the past, drug development was based on a short list of a few hundred targets, but with advances in 
technology, we are now able to identif y thousands of new potential drug targets.11 We can also study 
whole pathways, organ systems, or even entire organisms rather than limiting the research to a single 
aspect of cell biology or physiology.  Technologies such as large -scale sequencing, robotic h igh-
throughput screening, and real -time imaging modalities uncover massive amounts of data that may one 
day lead to new therapies to prevent, treat, and cure diseases.  
But this is not the only way in which technology contributes to this potential revoluti on in health care. 
Development of innovative point -of-care technologies is bringing diagnostics and therapeutics to 
patients’ bedsides while reducing costs.  
The need for new approaches to prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics is great.  Despite the prog ress 
of the past century, our nation continues to face daunting public health challenges.  Chronic burdens 
placed on our healthcare system through conditions such as obesity, mental disorders, and Alzheimer’s 
disease demand the innovative, scientifically -based solutions that NIH research derives.  In addition to 
these highly prevalent conditions, there are more than 6,800 rare diseases that affect an estimated 25 
to 30 million Americans.  NIH is often the only hope for those suffering from the se neglected diseases.   
We have never witnessed a time of greater promise for advances in medicine than right now.  Recent 
technological advancements have made the current pace of discovery unimaginable only a few years 
ago.  We need to capitalize on this mo ment and tackle the maladies that afflict millions of Americans and 
people around the world.  And we need to continue to improve our nation’s health.  We have achieved 
much since NIH’s beginning as a one -room laboratory, but we face many scientific challenge s ahead.  If 
our nation can exploit today’s unprecedented opportunities in biomedical research across the spectrum 
from basic science to clinical application,  we will be amazed at what tomorrow brings.

medical librarians and other health information specialists.  
  
 12 Overview of NIH St ructure and Organization   
NIH is the primary federal agency for leading, conducting, and supporting biomedical and behavioral 
research.  Composed of the O ffice of the Director  and 27 I nstitutes and Centers , NIH employs 
approximately  18,000 people and is the  steward of a $30 billion budget (FY 2011).  The leadership and 
financial support NIH provides to biomedical, behavioral, and social science researchers extends 
throughout our nation and the world.  
Institutes and Centers . The 27 NIH ICs are organized with a  focus on and expertise in a specific disease 
(e.g., cancer, diabetes), an organ system (e.g., heart, eye), life stage (e.g., children, the aging 
population), an overarching field of science (e.g., human genome, nursing , environmental health ), or a 
technol ogy (e.g., biomedical imaging, bioengineering, information technology).  The ICs support research 
and research training through extramural activities, and most also conduct research and research 
training through intramural activities.  
Office of the Directo r (OD) . The OD is composed of several offices that provide expert advice to the NIH 
Director and his leadership team.  It coordinates policy across the NIH research community and 
administers centralized support services essential to the NIH mission.  
The NI H Office of Extramural Research (OER) provides the corporate framework for NIH administration 
of research grants and contracts, ensuring scientific integrity, public accountability, and effective 
stewardship of the NIH extramural research portfolio.  Office s within OER include the Office of 
Laboratory Animal Welfare, Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration, Office of Extramural 
Programs, Office of Research Information Systems, Office of Planning and Communication, and Office of 
Administrative  Operations.   
The Office of Intramural Research (OIR) is responsible for oversight and coordination of intramural 
research conducted within NIH laboratories and clinics.  Offices within OIR include the Office of 
Intramural Training and Education, Office of Technology Transfer, Office of Human Subjects Research , 
and the Office of Animal Care and Use.  
The role of the OD Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strateg ic Initiatives (DPCPSI) is to 
identify emerging scientific opportunities, rising public health challenges, and scientific knowledge gaps 
that merit further research; assist NIH in effectively addressing identified areas; and develop and apply 
resources (da tabases, analytic tools, and methodologies) that will support priority setting and analyses 
of the NIH portfolio.  In addition, DPCPSI manages the NIH Demonstration Projects in High Risk/High 
Reward Research, an initiative to test new ways of fostering inno vation, which was also authorized 
through the Reform Act.  Lastly , DPCPSI plans, supports, and provides technical assistance for NIH 
program evaluations and manages NIH planning and reporting that are required by the Government 
Performance and Results Act a nd other government -wide performance assessment activitie s. The 
program offices  within DPCPSI are the Office of Strategic Coordination, which manages the NIH Common 
Fund , the Office of AIDS Research (OAR), the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Resea rch (OBSSR), 
 13 the Office of Disease Prevention (ODP), and the Office of Research on Women’s Health (ORWH) , and the 
Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (ORIP) .12  
The NIH Common Fund was enacted into law by Congress through the 2006 NIH Reform Act to s upport 
cross -cutting, trans -NIH programs that require participation by at least two NIH ICs or would otherwise 
benefit from strategic planning and coordination. The requirements for the Common Fund encourage 
collaboration across the ICs while providing the  NIH with flexibility to determine priorities for Common 
Fund support. To date, the Common Fund has been used to support a series of short term, exceptionally 
high impact, trans -NIH programs  
NIH Common Fund programs are intended to be:  
 Transformative: Must  have high potential to dramatically affect biomedical and/or behavioral 
research over the next decade  
 Catalytic: Must achieve a defined set of high impact goals within a defined period of time  
 Synergistic: Outcomes must synergistically promote and advance  individual missions of NIH 
Institutes and Centers to benefit health  
 Cross -cutting: Program areas must cut across missions of multiple NIH Institutes and Centers, be 
relevant to multiple diseases or conditions, and be sufficiently complex to require a coor dinated, 
trans -NIH approach  
 Unique: Must be something no other entity is likely or able to do  
DPCPSI also manages  four OD program offices —OAR, OBSSR, ODP, and ORWH . The Office of Dietary 
Supplements is a component within the ODP . The OD program offices fun d research using IC award -
making authorities.  ICs often partner with one of these  program office s to supplement their funding for 
a specific program or project.  
The OAR coordinates the scientific, budgetary, legislative, and policy elements of the NIH AIDS research 
program. OAR sets scientific priorities, enhances collaboration, and ensures that research dollars are 
invested in the highest priority areas of scientific opportunity that will lead to new tools in the global 
fight against AIDS.  
Other OD off ices that advise the NIH Director, develop NIH policy, and provide essential NIH -wide 
oversight and coordination include the Office of Communications and Public Liaison, the Office of 
Science Policy, the Office of Legislative Policy and Analysis, the Offic e of Management, the Office of 
Equal Opportunity and Diversity Management, the NIH Ethics Office, and the Office of the Chief 
Information Officer.   
                                                 
12 On December 23, 2011, President Barack Obama signed the Fiscal Year 2012 Omnibus Appropriations bill. As a 
result of this legislation, some of the National Center for Research Resources (NC RR) programs and the NIH Office 
of Science Education were transferred to the new Office of Research Infrastructure Prog rams (ORIP), DPCPSI, OD, 
NIH.  ORIP  directly funds research through a separate award authority  from those used by ICs . 
 14 ICs and OD office s. The following is a list of NIH ICs and select OD program offices presented in the order 
in which they appear on the appropriation table in the Congressional Justification.  Appendix B provides 
brief descriptions of the missions of the ICs and OD program offices and links to their strategic plans.  The 
mission statements and strategic plans prov ided in Appendix B classify and justify NIH priorities.  
Historical information about NIH, including the establishment of the categorical Institutes, Centers, and 
specialized offices, is maintained by the NIH Office of History, a component of OIR that prese rves 
records of significant NIH achievements, innovative exhibits, and educational programs to enhance 
understanding of NIH biomedical and behavioral research.

 16 Extramural and Intramural Research Programs   
As noted, NIH supports  research and research training through extramural activ ities and conducts  
research and research training through intramural activities.  This section provides overviews of the 
extramural and intramural programs.  
More than $8 of every $10 appropriated to NIH is awarded by the ICs to the extramural biomedical and  
behavioral research community through grants and contracts.  The extramural research community is 
composed of scientists, clinicians, and other research personnel affiliated with more than 2,600  
organizations, including universities, medical schools, hospi tals, and other research facilities located in 
all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and abroad.  In FY 2011, NIH 
funded more than 35,000 principal investigators through research grants, with many thousands more 
personnel supported by the projects.  With NIH support, these investigators, with their research teams, 
conduct the vast majority of research that leads to improvements in the prevention, detection, 
diagnosis, and treatment of disease and disability.  
The NIH Deputy D irector for Extramural Research  provides leadership and coordinates policy, guidance, 
and oversight for IC grant and programmatic management operations and is a conduit for extramural 
policy issues with the biomedical research community beyond NIH.  OER is where grants policy, program 
coordination, compliance, and services converge to support and sustain the NIH extramural research 
program.  
A primary service OER provides for the NIH grants program is the electronic Research Administration 
(eRA) syst em. eRA supports the grant administration functions for grantees and federal staff from the 
submission  of applications to the close out of awards.  eRA also provides services to other operating 
divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) , as well as  other federal agencies, and 
supports more than 100,000 investigators worldwide.  
Grants Overview  
NIH announces the availability of funds for grant programs by issuing funding opportunity 
announcements (FOAs)14 in the NIH Guide for Grants and Con tracts15 and on http://Grants.gov . The 
majority of NIH grant s funding is for projects that are investigator -initiated and submitted through 
omnibus parent announcements that span the breadth of the NIH mission.  NIH uses program 
announcements (PAs) , requests for applications (RFAs), and other types of FOAs, to solicit applications 
for funding  in targeted areas of research identified through strategic planning.  Because many FOAs are 
trans -NIH opportunities, their preparatio n can involve considerable collaboration.  In 2010, based on 
input from more than 1,000 stakeholders, OER implemented a shorter FOA format that eliminates 
redundancy, limits the amount of administrative detail, and directs applicants to the most up -to-date 
source of information.  
                                                 
14 An FOA is a publicly available document by which a federal agency makes known its intentions to award grants 
or cooperative agreements.  FOAs  may be known as PAs, RFAs , solicitations, or parent announcements.  
15 For more information, see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/.  
 17 The main types of grant funding provided by NIH are Research Grants (R series), Career Development 
Awards (K series), Research Training and Fellowships (T and F series), and Program Projects/Centers 
Grants (P series).  Activity codes that incorporate the funding series differentiate the wide variety of 
research and research -related awards made by NIH.  The most commonly used activity code is the R01, 
which designates a grant for a discrete, specified research project that is generally a warded for 3 –5 
years.  Receipt of an R01 traditionally is the mark of a scientist achieving scientific independence, and a 
faculty member’s track record with R01 awards often  is a significant factor in university promotion and 
tenure decisions.  Examples of other activity codes are:  
 R41/R42 and the R43/R44 for the Small Business Technology Transfer program and the Small 
Business Innovati on Research program, respectively;  
 R21 for exploratory/developmental research projects;  
 R15 for Academic Research Enhanceme nt Awards that support small -scale research projects at 
educational institutions that have not been major recipients of NIH research grants;  
 R24 for research projects that will enhance the capability of biomedical research resources;  
 R25 for research education projects;  
 F32 for postdoctoral individual fellowships under the National Research Service Award;  
 T32 for enabling institutions to make several National Research Service Awards for both pre - 
and postdoctoral training;  
 K08, a ca reer development award for providing support and “protected time” to individuals with 
a clinical doctoral degree for an intensive, supervised research career development experience;  
 P01 for research program projects that are broadly based, multidisciplina ry, often long -term 
research, which have a specific major objective or a basic theme; and  
 P30 for shared resources and facilities at research centers.  
ICs vary in the extent to which they use various activity codes.  
Other funding mechanisms are often appl ied to more unique applications. For example, NIEHS supports 
P42 grants, which are part of  the Superfund Research Program , a network of university grants designed  
to seek solutions to the complex health and environmental issues associated with the nation's worst 
hazardous waste sites.  The research conducted by the Superfund Research Program is funded and 
administered by the NIEHS  in coordination  with the U.S. Enviro nmen tal Protection Agency (EPA), the 
federal entity charged with cleaning up the se sites , and the HHS Agency for Toxic Substances and 
Disease Registry .  
  
 18 Contracts Overview  
The Research and Development Contracts mechanism is another means by which NIH supports research 
and research -related activities.  A research contract is typically used  to acquire goods or services for the 
direct benefit or use of the government . For example , contracts may be used  to support research in 
areas of significant scientific  interest, to further scientific knowledge, or to achieve a specific research 
goal.  A research contract differs from a grant in a number of respects  that are designed to comply with 
provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  These differences includ e the manner used to solicit 
and negotiate the requirement, the level of NIH participation during contract performance, and the 
control of study results.  Research contracts are awarded to universities, non -profit organizations, and 
profit making organizati ons.  Contract opportunities are announced in the NIH Guide for Grants and 
Contracts  and also on the federal -wide Web site FedBizOpps.gov .  
NIH Peer Review Process  
All NIH grant, fellowship, and cooperative agreement applications and contract proposals for research 
and development funding undergo evaluation through peer review, in which external expert panels 
determine which applications or proposals are the most scienti fically and technically meritorious (the 
first tier of peer review) and are most programmatically relevant and therefore should be considered for 
funding (the second tier of peer review). The NIH peer review process is designed to be fair, equitable, 
timel y, and free of bias. The NIH two -tiered peer review system is mandated by statute (section 492 of 
the Public Health Service Act) and by federal regulations governing “Scientific Peer Review of Research 
Grant Applications and Research and Development Contra ct Projects” (42 CFR Part 52h).16  
The Center for Scientific Review is the portal for receipt and referral of NIH grant applications and is the 
locus for the first level of review  for most applications.  Applications relevant to the NIH mission receive 
two a ssignments.  One assignment is to an IC that has a mission encompassing the aims and objectives of 
the application and potential interest in funding the application.  The other assignment is to the Scientific 
Review Group (SRG)  that will conduct the first le vel of review, including  evaluation of scientific and 
technical merit.  If the application is in response to a n RFA, the SRG most often will be convened by the 
IC(s) responsible for the initiative.  NIH uses established referral criteria to determine the app ropriate 
SRG to carry out review and the IC(s) most suitable to potentially fund the project.  
As noted above, the first level of review is conducted by SRGs that evaluate and give expert advice on 
the overall scientific and technical merit of the research proposed in the application, as well as the 
protection of human subjects, vertebrate animal welfare, and the budget and period of support 
requested.  SRGs conducting the first level of review are composed primarily of non -federal experts 
qualified by traini ng or experience in particular scientific or technical fields, or as authorities 
knowledgeable in the various disciplines and fields related to the applications under review.  No more 
than one -fourth of the members of any SRG may be federal employees.  SRGs may also include public 
members with perspective on the public health impact of the research being considered.  
                                                 
16 For more information, see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/peer_review_process.htm . 
 19 The second level of peer review is performed by the National Advisory Councils of each IC, which are 
composed of scientific and public members ch osen for their expertise, interest, or activity in matters 
related to a specific area of science, health , and/or disease.  The vast majority of SRG  -reviewed 
applications assigned to an IC go to the respective Council,17 which then recommends which  applicati ons 
should be considered for funding.  Identifying applications that further specific program priorities and 
potential public health impact is a particularly important function of this second level of peer review.  
Advisory Councils recommend projects for fu nding but do not make funding decisions.  
Funding Decisions  
Applications that are scientifically meritorious, based on SRG review, and favorably recommended by an 
IC’s National Advisory Council are considered for funding.  The score given to an application during the 
initial peer review process is important, but it is not the sole factor determining an IC’s funding decision.  
Other considerations are portfolio balance, requirements specified in congressional appropriations, 
programmatic relevance, IC priorities, and availability of funds.  
Many ICs establish a “payline ,” which is a percentile -based18 funding cutoff point  that is  determined at 
the beginning of the fiscal year by balancing the projected number of applications ass igned to an IC with 
the amount of funds expected by NIH and the IC to be available for such projects.  Applications that 
score within the payline are most likely to be funded.  However, Advisory Councils consider, evaluate, 
and make recommendations on specif ic applications that score both within and beyond the payline.  
In addition to setting paylines, many ICs establish procedures for funding applications that scored 
beyond the payline.  Terms used for this category of awards vary by IC, but include “select pa y,” 
“exception pools,” “high program -priority,” and “special emphasis.”  What is consistent is the use of 
these funds, with strong justification, to support highly innovative or high program -priority applications 
that score beyond the payline.  
Prior to  issuing an  award, NIH ensures that the planned research meets all requirements for safe and 
responsible conduct.  This includes making sure that the research has undergone all necessary reviews 
and has obtained required approvals from boards and committees cha rged with protection of human 
subjects; inclusion of minorities, women, and children; humane animal care and use; biosafety; and 
other matters, as appropriate.  NIH also ensures that the institution where the research takes place has 
necessary and appropria te policies in place for avoidance of financial conflicts of interest in research.  
 
 
                                                 
17 An application may be designated “Not Recommended for Further Consideration” (NRFC) at the first level of 
peer review if it lacks sig nificant and substantial merit; presents serious ethical problems in the protection of 
human subjects from research risks; or presents serious ethical problems in the use of vertebrate animals, 
biohazards, and/or Select Agents.  Applications designated as N RFC do not proceed to the second level of peer 
review (National Advisory Council/Board) because they cannot be funded.  
18 Percentile represents the relative position or rank (from 1 to 100) of each overall impact/priority score.  
 20 Post -Award Administration  
NIH policies extend into the post -award phase of research as well, so that NIH can monitor research 
progress and provide oversight to ensure res ponsible conduct of research.  Scientific monitoring includes 
reviewing yearly progress and financial reports submitted by grantees, the publications generated by the 
research, and any invention reports.19 NIH also monitors compliance with federal laws and p olicies 
pertaining to protection of human subjects, the care and use of vertebrate animals used in research, 
data sharing, the NIH Public Access Policy, and other matters.  In addition, oversight of clinical research 
may involve data and safety monitoring a nd monitoring  of inclusion of participants by sex/gender, race, 
and ethnicity  in clinical research.  
Intramural Research Program  
Approximately 11 percent of NIH funds support research and training activities carried out by NIH 
scientists in NIH laboratories on its campuses in the Bethesda (including the NIH Clinical Center), 
Rockville, Frederick, and Baltimore  areas in  Maryland; Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Detroit, 
Michigan; Phoenix, Arizona; and the Rocky Mountain Laboratories  in Ham ilton , Montana.  Approximately 
1,200 principal investigators lead intramural research projects that involve more than 6,000 trainees 
ranging from high school students to postdoctoral and clinical fellows.  OIR is responsible for trans -NIH 
oversight and coord ination of intramural research, human subject protections, animal welfare, training, 
policy development, laboratory safety, and technology transfer conducted within NIH laboratories and 
clinics.  OIR is led by the NIH Deputy Director for Intramural Research , and each IC intramural research 
program is led by an IC Scientific Director.  OIR oversight is carried out in conjunction with the IC 
Scientific Directors.  A summary of policies governing intramural research can be found in the Intramural 
Research Sourceb ook.20  
The NIH intramural research programs conduct basic, translational, and clinical research.  
Organizationally, the individual laboratories and clinics report to their respective IC and are responsible 
for conducting original research consistent with th e goals of the IC.  Most ICs have an intramural 
program.  As with the extramural program, intramural research proposals are generated by scientists.  In 
the intramural research program, however, program directions and research priorities are not shaped 
primar ily through grant awards21 but rather through professional hiring and promotion decisions, 
external reviews, and the allocation of resources to laboratories and branches.  
Each intramural research program has a promotion and tenure committee that evaluates all 
recommendations for professional appointment or promotion, and tenured and tenure -track scientists 
undergo formal internal reviews  annually . Resource allocations and promotions are determined based 
on these reviews.  In addition, at least every four yea rs, an external expert Board of Scientific Counselors 
                                                 
19 For more information, see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/sbir_sttr_invention_letter.htm , 
http://grants.nih.gov/gr ants/guide/notice -files/not95 -003.html , and https://s -
edison.info.nih.gov/iEdison/timeline.jsp .  
20 For more information, see http://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/ . 
21 The exception is that intramural investigators are eligible to compete for most NIH Roadmap initiatives to allow 
qualified intramural researchers to contribute to the goals of Roadmap programs.  
 21 reviews the work of each tenured/tenure -track scientist and makes recommendations regarding 
continuation or modification of projects and adjustment of resources (e.g., budget, space, and 
personnel).  Mor eover, IC Scientific Directors are evaluated by an external committee every five years, 
and each IC intramural research program is reviewed, in its entirety, by a “blue ribbon” panel 
approximately every 10 years.  These panels assess and make recommendation s concerning the impact 
of the research program, program balance, and other significant matters that play a role in the success 
of the program.  
Two offices manage research training for OIR.  The Office of Intramural Training and Education is charged 
with h elping trainees in the intramural research program, including graduate students in partnership 
with universities in the U.S. and abroad, to develop scientific and professional skills  needed  to become 
leaders in the biomedical research community.  The Office  of Clinical Research Training and Medical 
Education deals with all aspects of clinical training.  
NIH also provides primary administrative and research capacity for the National Toxicology Program, a 
federal interagency research program headquartered at th e NIEHS, whose goal is to safeguard the public 
by identifying which of the many thousands of chemicals and other substances that humans are exposed 
to in the environment are toxic and  may affect human health.  Current National Toxicology Program 
initiatives  examine  the effects of cell phone radiation, endocrine disruptors, and nanomaterials, as well 
as developing new approaches to  advance high throughput (high speed and high quantity) screening of 
chemicals, and to reduce the number of animals used in resear ch. 
NIH Clinical Center  
The Clinical Center is the nation’s largest hospital devoted entirely to clinical research  and patient care . 
Research at the Clinical Center is conducted with access to cutting -edge technologies in an environment 
of compassionate care.  This world -class national resource promotes translational research —the 
transformation of scientific observations and laboratory discoveries into applications for diagnosing, 
treating, and preventing disease that benefit patient health and medical car e. Composed of two 
facilities —the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (2005) and the original Warren Grant Magnuson 
Clinical Center (1953) —the center houses 240 inpatient beds, 82 day -hospital stations, an ambulatory 
care research facility, 12 operat ing rooms, critical care facilities, advanced radiology and imaging 
capabilities, and research laboratories.  The unique design of the facility locates patient care units in 
proximity to laboratories conducting related research.  This design facilitates inte raction and 
collaboration among intramural clinicians and researchers  to enhance patient care .  
More than 1,500 studies are in progress at the Clinical Center, bringing 10,000 new research participants 
per year from all 50 states and throughout the world.  The center has more than 95,000 outpatient visits 
a year and 6,000 inpatient admissions.  Approximately 1,200 credentialed physicians, dentists, and Ph.D. 
researchers, 620 nurses, and 450 allied health care professionals, such as pharmacists, dietitians, an d 
medical technologists, work at the center.  As a research facility, the Clinical Center enrolls healthy 
volunteers and patients with common and rare conditions. Those with mysterious conditions that have 
 22 long eluded diagnosis are also seen through the Und iagnosed Diseases Program, a clinical research 
program in collaboration with the NIH Office of Rare Diseases  and NHGRI .  
In 2011, the Clinical Center received the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation’s Lasker ~Bloomberg Public 
Service Award, “ for serving since  its inception as a model research hospital —providing innovative 
therapy and high -quality patient care, treating rare and severe diseases, and producing outstanding 
physician -scientists whose collective work has set a standard of excellence in biomedical r esearch.”  
In addition to the Clinical Center on the main campus, NIH supports satellite clinical research facilities 
through various ICs. For example, the NIEHS Clinical Research Unit, located on the institute’s North 
Carolina campus, is focused on studyi ng the interactions of genetics and environmental exposures in the 
development of disease, conducting pharmacokinetic studies on environmental chemicals, as well as 
identifying populations at increased risk, with the goal of developing novel preventive and  therapeutic 
strategies to address human disease.  
  
 23 Providing the Platform for Discovery   
 
Research Training and Career Development   
The biomedical and behavioral research conducted and supported by NIH —ranging from basic to 
applied —has long been recognized as critical to advancing the quality of health care in the nation and 
the world.  As a result of NIH research, diseases such as AIDS, strok e, heart disease, and diabetes are 
being treated or prevented more successfully.  Further research undoubted ly will lead to new or 
improved medical therapies for a spectrum of diseases and disorders . However, new advances in 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment largely  depend  on the creativity, insight, and resources of the best 
scientists,  and for these benefit s to continue, there must be a regular source of highly trained, well -
equipped, and innovative new investigators.  Research training is where it all begins.  
NIH research training and career development programs are designed to prepare new researchers to 
mee t the demands of emerging problems in medicine and health  and ensure that diverse pools of highly 
trained scientists are available in sufficient numbers and with appropriate expertise to generate new 
discoveries, take advantage of rapidly moving scientific  developments, and bring science to bear on 
complex and evolving health care challenges.  By sponsoring research training and career development 
programs in universities, teaching hospitals, NIH laboratories, and other research -intensive settings, NIH 
expec ts that trainees and newly trained investigators will not only be exposed to the latest research 
findings and techniques, but also that they will be  positioned  to respond to developing national and 
international public health needs . NIH takes extra efforts  to foster new investigators  that focus  on 
under -researched areas such as clinical and translational research, rare diseases, health disparities, and 
global health  issues.  
The task of assessing and predicting research personnel needs across the entire spec trum of health -
related research — basic biomedical sciences, behavioral and social sciences, clinical sciences, oral health 
sciences, nursing research, health services research, and the interdisciplinary junctures between fields —
is daunting.  Aligning the re quisite expertise with public health needs is complicated by the evolving 
nature of research; the time required for research training; the international nature of research; and the 
mobility of the global research workforce.  Preparing for a career in resear ch generally requires a 
commitment of 8 –10 years or more of pre -doctoral and postdoctoral training and career development; 
in the meantime, science is advancing, new diseases are emerging, and existing diseases are becoming 
better understood, diagnosed, an d prevented.  
In determining how best to address  the continuing need for biomedical and behavioral scientists, NIH is 
guided by regularly scheduled analyses of the research workforce.  Chief among these assessments are 
recurring studies conducted by the Nat ional Academ y of Sciences , which provide guidance on the fields 
in which researchers are likely to be required , as well as  on the number of n ew investigators needed in 
the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical sciences.  NIH also routinely evaluates the outc omes of its 
training programs, comparing the subsequent research involvement of students and postdoctoral 
scholars who participate in NIH research training with their counterparts who were trained through 
 24 other sources . Beyond such agency -wide assessments, individual ICs determine the need for new 
scientific personnel in mission -specific research areas through targeted evaluations, input from 
extramural investigators, and guidance from their national advisory councils.  
NIH offers a broad range of research training and career development opportunities in its extramural 
and intramural research communities, through institutional training awards and individual fellowships, 
individual and institutional career development award s, research education programs, workshops, 
research grants, and supplements to promote diversity or reentry into health -related research careers.  
Although its programs are largely directed toward graduate students and newly trained investigators, 
NIH offer s a number of highly focused training and career development opportunities for individuals at 
other career stages, from college students to established scientists.  
Catalogs of Research Training Activities  
In response to the mandate under SEC. 403 (a)(4)(C )(iv) of the Public Health Service  Act to provide 
catalogs of research training activities , Appendix E includ es the following : 
 Funded Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award  (NRSA) and NLM  Institutional Research 
Training Grants, FY 20 09 and FY 2010  
 Funded Kirschstein -NRSA Individual Fellowship Awards, FY 2010 and FY 2011  
Trans -NIH Programs and Initiatives  
Training for a career in research typically requires a combination of specialized coursework and hands -
on research experiences under the gui dance of an established investigator.  Most NIH -funded research 
training activities focus on predoctoral students and postdoctoral scholars and are provided either 
through training grants (T awards), which are awarded to institutions to support a coordinate d program 
of training for a group of students or scholars, or fellowships (F awards), which directly support an 
individual’s training.  The principal (in terms of  size and breadth of coverage ) NIH research training 
program for U.S. citizens and permanent re sidents is the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service 
Award22 (NRSA) program.  The goal of the NRSA program is to support promising students and 
postdoctoral scholars with the potential to become productive, independent investigators in fields 
relevant to NIH’s mission.  Training activities can be in basic biomedical or clinical sciences, in behavioral 
or social sciences, in health services research, or in any other discipline relevant to the NIH mission, and 
always include s instruction in the re sponsible conduct of research.  All ICs with funding authority award 
NRSA institutional research training grants and fellowships, except FIC and NLM.  Reflecting the unique 
nature of their missions, the se two ICs have distinct training authorities, separate from the NRSA 
program.  
Through the NIH -wide program of NRSA institutional training grants and fellowships, NIH ICs supported 
over  16,000 graduate students and postdoctoral scholars at universities, teaching hospitals, and 
research centers in nearly every s tate in FY 2011.  Institutional training grants form the core of NIH’s 
                                                 
22 For more information, see http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/RuthKirschstein . 
 25 research training programs, providing support to more than 80 percent of all NRSA program 
participants.  Training grants play a particularly important role at the predoctoral level: appro ximately 60 
percent of trainees are graduate students, who are often engaged in coursework and laboratory 
rotations in preparation for identifying an area of research for in -depth study.  (See Appendix E for a 
breakdown on the demographics of NRSA participa nts and a summary of the number and type of 
doctoral degrees awarded to predoctoral NRSA recipients.)  
Individuals interested in research training in universities or departments that do not offer  institutional 
training grants, as well as advanced students and postdoctoral scholars seeking tailored training 
opportunities, have the option of applying directly to NIH for an individua l research training fellowship. 
NRSA fellowships provide recipients with valuable experience in initiating and testing their own research 
ideas before becoming full -fledged investigators.  
Across NIH, NRSA training grants and fellowships help ensure the diversity of the research workforce by 
promoting  research training opportunities for individuals from populations and backgrounds ty pically 
underrepresented in research.  At the graduate and postdoctoral levels, NIH policy requires institutional 
training grant directors to take steps to recruit and retain trainees from underrepresented groups, 
including racial and ethnic groups and indi viduals with disabilities.  Through the Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA 
Individual Predoctoral Fellowship (F31) to Promote Diversity in Health -Related Research,23 NIH also 
provides graduate students from underrepresented groups with opportunities to pursue research  
training through individual fellowship awards.  Because part of the inherent challenge of recruiting 
talented individuals into research training programs is to have a pool of prepared applicants from which 
to draw, NIH offers undergraduate research trainin g to honors students who have an explicit interest in 
a research career and  who  intend to pursue postgraduate education leading to a Ph.D., M.D./Ph.D., or 
other combined  research  degree at selected institutions.   
The relative diversity of research training  participants reflects NIH’s commitment to cultivating a broad -
based scientific workforce.  Among FY 2011 trainees and fellows who reported their race and ethnicity, 
66 percent were White, 15.3 percent were Asian, 7.7 percent were African American, 8.6 perc ent were 
Hispanic, 1 percent were Native American, and 0.6 percent were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islanders.  
More than 52 percent of trainees and fellows in FY 2011 were women.  
NRSA training grants and fellowships may target broad -based or field -specific research training, 
depending on the needs identified by the administering IC.  In recent years, this flexibility has allowed 
the NRSA program to accommodate interest in greater integration of training activities across NIH in 
order to fulfill workforce need s shared by multiple ICs.   
Notable example s include  the training grants and institutional career development awards in clinical and 
translational research that have been incorporated into the growing network of Clinical and 
Translational Science Awards24 (CTSAs) administered by NCRR .25 Now active at 60 sites around the

 26 country, the CTSA program provides research training and career development opportunities in areas 
such as clinical research design, epidemiology, biostatistics, pharmacology, biomedical inf ormatics, 
behavioral science, and ethics to over 9 00 NRSA trainees and new investigators annually.  (CTSA trainees 
are included in the NRSA data provided in Appendix E .) NCRR  also joined forces with NCI, NIDA, NIGMS, 
and NINR to provide career development o pportunities for young investigators interested in cross -
training in patient -oriented research, pharmacogenomics, and personalized medicine.   
Another trans -NIH initiative is the Early Independence Awards .26 These awards, supported by the NIH 
Common Fund , provide newly -trained scientists who are ready and able to work independent of a 
mentor  a chance to forgo the traditional period of postdoctoral training after receiving their doctoral 
degree and pursue their own program of independent research.  The first gr oup of 10 such new 
investigators to receive these awards was selected in 2011 and is being closely monitored to determine 
the effects of early research funding on innovation.  
In addition to its formal research training programs, NIH supports graduate and postdoctoral research 
experiences on research grants.  Though not an NIH "program" per se, the impact of this support is 
significant.  Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars acting as research assistants —often before or 
after a NRSA training grant appoi ntment or fellowship —gain knowledge, skills, and experience that help 
prepare them for careers in research.  
To provide a better understanding of how graduate students and postdoctorate  fellows  contribute to 
research projects, NIH investigators were asked to identify all research project personnel on their annual 
progress reports, beginning with those due in FY 2010.  After analyzing the first full year of data, NIH has 
calculated that more than 23,000 graduate students and 28,000 postdoctorate  fellows  are e mployed as 
research assistants or associates on research grants.  As these personnel data continue to accrue, NIH 
plans further analyses to obtain a greater understanding of the staffing patterns of research grants and 
the biomedical research workforce supp orted by its funding.  
IC Programs and Initiatives  
Because each NIH IC has its own particular research mission, individual ICs are responsible for 
determining how the workforce needs identified by the National Academ y of Sciences  and others apply 
to their specific scientific fields, selecting individuals and institutions for NRSAs or other research 
training awards to meet the needs identified, and reviewing annual progress toward building or 
enhancing capacity in the research workforce.  Areas targeted for r esearch training initiatives reflect the 
full array of NIH interests, from basic research training in biology and chemistry to clinical and 
translational research training in fields like cancer, infectious diseases, and aging.  To ensure a supply of 
investi gators attuned to the challenges of both research and patient care, a number of ICs also make 
                                                                                                                                                             
25 On December 23, 2011, President Barack Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112 -74). 
As part of this legislation, the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) is dissolved and the National Center 
for Advancing Translational Sc iences (NCATS) is established. Science Education Partnership Awards (SEPA) is now 
part of the NIH Office of the Director, Division of Program Coordination, Planning and Strategic Initiatives, Office of 
Research Infrastructure Programs.

 27 awards for M.D./Ph.D. and other types of dual -degree training.  The oldest and largest of these is the 
NIGMS Medical Scientist Training Program, which supports exc eptional students pursuing an integrated 
program of graduate training in the biomedical sciences and clinical medicine.  
Reflecting the FIC mission to foster global health research and build research capacity in low- and 
middle -income countries , FIC instit utional training grants (D43s) differ from those offered by the NRSA 
program or by NLM by allowing a broader range of participants and emphasizing the development of 
institutional partnerships and collaborations between U.S. and international universities and scientists.  
Most FIC research training programs target individuals from low - and middle -income nations, but a 
number of selected  programs provide opportunities to U.S. students and postdoctoral fellows  interested 
in global  health research.  Ultimately, the aim of FIC’s research training programs is to strengthen 
sustainable research capacity in the developing world.  
NLM’s research training portfolio generally parallels the structure and requirements of the NRSA 
program and reflects NLM’s unique role as t he primary federal sponsor of biomedical informatics 
research and training.  NLM prepares the next generation of informatics researchers and health 
information specialists through institutional grants27 (T15s), which support graduate and postdoctoral 
trainin g in a broad range of topics, including health care informati cs, translational bioinformatics, clinical 
research informatics , and public health informatics , as well as some specialized areas such as imaging or 
dental informatics . NLM also offers a clinical  informatics  research  fellowship on the NIH campus 
designed to attract physicians and others to  NIH to pursue research in clinical informatics.  Unlike NRSA 
research training awards, some NLM training programs are open to master’s degree holders seeking 
further graduate -level coursework and hands -on training.  
Extramural Programs and Progress: Career Development  
Given the  ever -quickening  pace at which science advances , investigators need opportunities to fully 
develop their scientific expertise and stay up to date.  NIH Career Development Awards28 (K awards) 
address th is need.  Collectively, more than a dozen types of K awards support investigators as they 
establish their research careers, pursue new directions, or dedicate themselves to training and 
mentoring the next generation of scientists.  Like the T and F training awards, some career development 
awards support institutional activities to nurture careers , and others directly support individual 
development.  
Many career development awards are designed for res earchers at specific career stages, particularly 
newly trained investigators.  The NIH -wide Pathway to Independence Award29 accelerates the transition 
from mentored to independent research by providing a bridging mechanism  of an initial mentored 
period of 1 –2 years followed by an independent phase, during which awardees establish their own 
research programs and apply for independent research support.  Other “mentored” career development 
awards provide support for a sustained period of “protected time ” for inte nsive research career

 28 development under the guidance of an experienced investigator.  The expectation is that, with this 
experience, awardees will be able to take the final steps toward establishing independent research 
careers and becoming competitive for new research project grant funding.  At the other end of the 
career spectrum, a number of ICs provide career development opportunities to mid -career and 
established investigators . These awards provide salary support for outstanding senior scientists and 
recognized leaders so that  they can focus intensively on their research and mentor new investigators.  
NIH Training and Career Development Program Evaluations and Assessments  
Since the NRSA program was established in 1974 , NIH training programs have been regularly reviewed 
and evaluated.  The National Academ y of Sciences  has undertaken regular reviews of the medical 
research workforce and made recommendations for modifications in the size and focus of the NRSA 
program.  In addition, NRSA program processes an d outcomes are regularly assessed through recurring 
program evaluations and performance is evaluated annually using Government Performance and Results 
Act (GPRA) goals.  These reviews have been coordinated by OER, which oversees the NRSA program . 
NAS review s. Over the past 30 years, the NRSA program has been the subject of more than a dozen 
studies by the National Academ y of Sciences , which has provided expert guidance on the fields in which 
researchers are likely to be required and on the number of new inve stigators needed in the basic 
biomedical, behavioral, and clinical sciences.  The most recent National Academ y of Sciences  report on 
research training, published in 2011, noted that the NRSA program has “set the standard” for research 
training.30 
The recurring nature of these National Academ y of Sciences  studies ensures that NIH research training 
programs reflect changes in science and research needs that inevitably occur over time.  In recent years, 
NIH has followed recommendations from National Academ y of Sciences  committees for enhancing 
stipend levels, promoting the early completion of research training, and improving workforce data 
collection and analysis.  
Evaluation of NIH training and career development programs . Evaluations of the outcomes of NRS A 
research training routinely have found that graduate students participating in NRSA programs complete 
their degrees faster, are more likely to pursue research careers, and have greater subsequent success in 
research than do students not participating in NRSA programs.31 Similarly, assessments of NRSA 
postdoctoral training have found that NRSA postdoctoral fellows are more likely to successfully pursue 
research careers.  In FY 2011, a round 30  percent of former NRSA postdoctoral fellows who subsequently 
appli ed for a major NIH research grant received funding, compared to 17 percent of other postdoctoral 
fellows.32  
Most recently, NIH evaluated the effects of its three most widely used types of mentored career 
development awards : K01, K08, and K23. Comparing s imilar groups of funded and unfunded applicants,

32 For more information, see http://www.hhs.gov/budget/performance -appendix -fy2013.pdf .  
 29 those who received a career development award were more likely to remain in research, publish their 
research findings, apply for and receive major NIH research grants, and, for those whose careers were 
track ed for sufficient time , apply for and receive a grant renewal.33 While all investigators receiving 
these career development awards fared well, the opportunity for a mentored career development 
experience had the greatest impact on M.D.s and M.D./Ph.D.s.   
Government Performance and Results Act  (GPRA)  measures . Every year, NIH reports on  NRSA research 
training outcomes and program management using three  GPRA  measures . In the first two measures , 
NIH seeks to assess the quality of its programs and determine if  substantial numbers of trainees and 
fellows are retained in research careers by comparing the proportion of former NRSA trainees and 
fellows who apply for and successfully receive NIH research grant support against their peers.  
Subsequent NIH support is o ne of several measures that reflect the impact of NRSA research training on 
participants’ ability to  successfully  pursue and sustain a research career.  To date, NIH has generally  met 
these GPRA measures  because NRSA trainees and fellows consistently outper form their counterparts.  
The third training -related GPRA measure  assesses  NIH progress in improving the efficiency of NRSA 
program management by developing and implementing the xTrain electronic system for appointing 
trainees to institutional training gran ts. The system was piloted in 2008, improved, and then required 
NIH-wide in mid -2011.  By the end of FY 2011, 99.3 percent of trainee appointment forms were 
submitted electronically.  In 2012, when the system is fully implemented, xTrain is expected to save 
substantial staff time and eliminate data entry errors while increasing NIH’s efficiency and enhancing the 
integrity of data used for program monitoring and evaluation purposes.  
Institute and Center training evaluations . In addition to scheduled NIH -wide assessments of programs 
coordinated through OER, individual NIH ICs undertake periodic, targeted evaluations to improve 
implementation and assess outcomes of their own training programs.  For example, as mandated by the 
NIH Reform Act of 2006 (Pub. L. No. 1 09-482), in 2010 -2011, NCRR conducted an evaluation of  the 
outcomes and effectiveness of CTSA training programs.  The evaluation34 include d surveys of trainees, 
scholars, and mentors and address ed pediatric clinical research training issues in particular.  
Coordination and Oversight by the NIH Office of Extramural Research  
OER partners with ICs to coordinate and monitor awards for research training and career development 
across NIH.  With active input from the ICs, OER establishes and implements policies and g uidelines for 
each of the programs; determines broad national needs for basic biomedical, behavioral, and clinical 
research personnel; coordinates NIH -wide evaluations; develops trans -NIH research initiatives in which 
NIH ICs participate; and develops and maintains information systems to enhance program efficiencies.  
OER convenes monthly meetings of the NIH Training Advisory Committee to provide an agency -wide 
forum to identify and discuss issues related to research training and to provide opportunities to

 30 coordinate activities pertinent to the review, administration, management, and evaluation of training 
grants and fellowships.  
Intramural Activities  
The NIH intramural program provides opportunities for students, postdoctoral scholars, and clinicians to 
gain research experience within the more than 1,100 NIH intramural laboratories.  A multifaceted array 
of programs provides a vibrant, scholarly environment and ensures strong research training experiences 
for future investigators and the continued professiona l development of intramural scientists.  
Among the intramural program’s offerings are summer internships for high school, college, and 
graduate students.  Recent college graduates who plan to apply to graduate or professional school also 
can spend a year en gaged in biomedical research working side by side with NIH scientists.  Current 
graduate students can spend a summer, or a year, as fellows engaged in biomedical research at NIH.  The 
Graduate Partnerships Program35 enables students to pursue research at NIH toward their degrees in 
partnership with a participating academic institution.  By linking academic environments with the 
breadth and depth of research at NIH, the Graduate Partnerships Program offers a unique graduate 
experience.  Similarly, the Clinical Re search Training Program36 provides research -oriented medical and 
dental students an opportunity to engage in a mentored clinical or translational research project on the 
NIH campus.   
Training opportunities continue when scholars gain their graduate degrees.  Year -round, NIH intramural 
laboratories employ fellows from the U.S. and abroad, creating a thriving, multidisciplinary intramural 
research community.  The Postdoctoral Intramural Research Training Award37 provides the opportunity 
for recent doctoral degree  recipients who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents to enhance their 
research skills in the NIH intramural environment.  Trainees pursue both basic and clinical research.  A 
parallel program, Visiting Fellowships, serves foreign national doctoral -level scientists.  For clinicians, 
there are opportunities for residency and subspecialty training, inclu ding graduate medical education 
accredited programs . (For program completion data, see Appendix E .) These graduate medical education 
programs enable research -oriented clinicians to weave research experience and training into their post -
medical school training.   
In recent years, NIH’s intramural program increasingly has focused on helping graduate students and 
postdoctoral fellows develop their career skills.  To ensure that intramural trainees and fellows can 
successfully advance in their careers, NIH offers courses in scientific writing and grant writing, as well as 
presentation and teaching skills.  In addition, intramural trainees and fellows —indeed, all member s of 
the NIH community —benefit from access to a wealth  of NIH courses, seminars, and science career 
resources.

 31 In late 2011, NIH unveiled plans for a new "intramural -extramural" partnership to nurture the next 
generation of clinical researchers, funded in  part by the Lasker Foundation.  Individuals selected as 
Lasker Clinical Research Scholars38 have the opportunity to serve as an investigator in the NIH intramural 
program.  If they choose to work in an extramural setting after their time as a Lasker Scholar,  they can 
qualify for additional years of support at an extramural research institution.   
NIH Loan Repayment Programs  
The NIH Loan Repayment Program39 is a vital component of our nation’s efforts to attract eligible 
doctoral -level professionals to research careers in fields of special importance , including clinical, 
pediatric, health disparities, contraception and infertility, and AIDS research.  To encourage qualified 
scientists to pursue research in these critical areas, the Loan Repayment Program  provides financial 
assistance for educational debt in exchange for a two - or three -year research commitment.  Over  1,600 
program participants each year receive up to $35,000 annually in loan repayment and fulfill their 
commitments by conducting research in nonprofit , university, or government settings, or as an NIH 
employee.  
Science Education and Literacy  
To remain a world leader in biomedical research we must encourage and support students’ curiosity and 
interest in science throughout their education. NIH funds a number of science education and literacy 
activities from grammar school to undergraduate students. These programs support c urriculum 
development, mentoring programs, outreach, and research experiences designed to recruit individuals 
with specific backgrounds to research careers or to increase the diversity of the biomedical workforce.  
NIH takes an active role in pre -college (K -12) science education and in science lite racy activities.  These 
activities aim to improve the science knowledge and skills of students, attract young people to 
biomedical and behavioral science careers, lay the groundwork for advanced study, enhance public 
understanding of health science, and emp ower the public as consumers of science and health 
information.  
Curriculum supplem ents —ready -to-use, interactive teaching units —are one of NIH’s most popular and 
effective science education efforts.  Crafted through a unique collaboration of NIH scientists , teachers, 
and expert curriculum developers, the supplements are aligned with state education standards and are 
consistent with the National Science Education Standards.  NIH has shipped more than 430,000 
curriculum supplements upon request to K -12 educato rs across the nation.  Topics covered include The 
Science of Healthy Behaviors , Cell Biology and Cancer , The Brain: Understanding Neurobiology through

high school biology classes and Rare Diseases and Scientific Inquiry for middle schools.40  
NIH’s Diabetes Education in Tribal Schools Project41 is a K -12 curriculum  developed to i ncrease the 
understanding of health, diabetes, and maintaining life in balance among American  Indian/Alaska Native 
students; i ncrease America n Indian/Alaska Native students’  understanding and application of scientific 
and community knowledge ; and i ncrease interest in science and health professions among American 
Indian/Alaska Native youth . The project aims  to change perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes about 
diabetes through classroom learning experiences that will empower students to adopt healthier 
lifestyles.  
NIH provides other types of school resources as well.  Findings42 is a sem i-annual magazine targeted to 
high school and early college students t hat describes  the excitement of cutting -edge research, the 
interesting people who pursue science careers, and the enjoyment they get from this work.  A 
companion Web site offers videos, p odcasts, and interactive games expanding on the printed material.  
NIH also offers topical publications and school resources, such as slide kits, online quizzes, and science 
puzzles that are used by teachers across the country to augment textbooks and enric h the classroom 
experience.  Subject areas include cell biology, genetics, structural biology, chemistry, pharmacology, 
and computational biology.  Classroom posters linked to selected publications also promote interest in 
science and research careers and co ntinue to be tremendously popular.  
NIH aims to engage students and the public in the wonders of biology and biomedical research through 
other programs, as well.  For those who are interested in a career in the life sciences, NIH provides 
resources such as L ifeWorks®, a career exploration Web site for middle and high school students, and 
their parents, teachers, and career guidance counselors.43 Users can search the site for in -depth 
information on more than 125 health and medical science -related careers and g enerate a customized 
list of careers that match their skills and interests.  SciLife is an annual health and biomedical career -
planning workshop for parents and high school students.44 NIH also sponsors a speakers’ bureau that 
provides engaging science professionals to talk to school groups and local and national organizations.  
The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research , a cooperative effort among 16 NIH Institutes, Centers 
and Offices  that support neuroscience research , offers a K-12 Science  Education  Award.  NIH Blueprint 
funded eight  science education grants that seek to improve and enhance neuroscience  education in 
grades K -12 as well as inspire future generations of neuroscientists.  The grants focus on providing 
innovative  neuroscience  education to children throughout the U.S. through a variety of mechanisms , 
such as the development of interactive teaching modules that can be accessed on iOS devices (e.g., the

components as well as classroom activities.  
NCRR 's Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) program45 enables researchers, educators, and 
community groups to share their knowledge, expertise, and enthusiasm about health and science 
research with K -12 students and the general public.  SEPA -funded classroom - and museum -based 
projects generate resources, such  as hands -on and problem based curricula, interactive health exhibits, 
films, and after -school and summer student intern and teacher professional development opportunities.  
The SEPA Web site, http:// www.nihsepa.org , maintained by the SEPA community, provides universal 
access to educational resources, teachers training, health -based museum exhibits, and evaluation 
models that are developed by these SEPA -funded projects . 
Individual NIH ICs also have science education pr ograms focused on their specific missions. For example, 
NIDA supports a Science Education in Drug Abuse Partnership Award, modeled after the SEPA program. 
The purpose of the Science Education in Drug Abuse Partnership Award  program is to fund the 
developme nt and evaluation of innovative programs and materials for enhancing knowledge and 
understanding of neuroscience and the biology of drug abuse and addiction among K -12 students, the 
general public, health care practitioners, the media, and other groups.

 Overview of NIH Research  
Introduction   
In pursuit of its mission to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems 
and to apply that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce the burdens of illness and 
disability, NIH conducts and supports biomedical and behavioral research across a broad spectrum of 
scientific disciplines and approaches.  NIH scientists may have been trained in any number of disciplines, 
from molecular biology to demography to engineerin g. Yet, as science and technology have advanced 
and the complexity of the issues addressed has grown, the disciplinary boundaries that previously 
defined science have become blurred, such that NIH research is not delineated by scientific discipline, 
but in stead by a continuum of inquiries.  
NIH research is predicated on the understanding of ongoing and newly emerging public health needs.  As 
these needs are identified, scientific approaches are brought to bear across a continuum of research 
designed to under stand basic causes and mechanisms of disease , find new ways of identifying and 
interrupting disease processes based on this understanding , and bring these new interventions into 
common practice so that all may benefit.  The path from basic research to clini cal practice (see Figure 2 -
1) is not a continuum in the strictest sense, because all steps of biomedical and behavioral research, 
from basic to translational to clinical, can inform other areas.  For example, findings in clinical research 
can provide new ar eas of inquiry in basic science.   
Figure 2 -1. NIH Supports the Full Continuum of Biomedical Research  
 
Step 1.  The research continuum begins with basic research , the study of the fundamental mechanisms of 
biology  and behavior.  Investments in basic biomedical and behavioral research make it possible to 
understand the causes of disease onset and progression.  Basic research is essential to the development 
of better diagnostics, the design of preventive interventions, and the discovery of new treatments  and 
cures.  Thus, basic research is a critical component of the nation’s public investment in research and a 
central feature of NIH’s research program.  
In the past, most basic science projects in biomedicine required investigators to limit the scope of the ir 
studies to a single aspect of cell biology or physiology.  With the advent of technologies that can 

 35 automate research techniques at rapid speed (e.g., high throughput technology), the revolution now 
sweeping the field is the ability to be comprehensive ( i.e., the genes of the human or a model organism, 
the human proteins and their structures, the common variations in the genome, the major pathways for 
signal transduction in the cell, the patterns of gene expression in the brain, the steps involved in earl y 
development, and the components of the immune system).  Technologies contributing to these 
advances, many of which have moved from the development stage to broad use across the research 
community in the last few years, include DNA sequencing, microarray t echnology, nanotechnology, new 
imaging modalities, and computational biology.  
Step 2 . Realizing the benefits of fundamental biomedical discoveries depends on the translation of 
knowledge into the development of new diagnostics, therapeutics, and preventive  measures.  NIH is a 
key supporter of early (preclinical) translational research —studies that serve as a bridge between basic 
research and human medicine.  The early translational stage applies fundamental laboratory discoveries 
to the preclinical development of studies in humans.  Such early translational investigations often are 
carried out using animal models, cultures, samples of human or animal cells, or a variety of experimental 
systems, such as computer -assisted modeling of disease progression  and drug therapy.  
This is an  extraordinarily exciting time to advance translational science and speed the development of 
new cures.  Through the application of genomic research and high throughput technologies, 
breakthroughs in understanding of the causes of many diseases and the identification of new targets 
and pathways for the development of new therapeutics are within reach.  Coupled with these advances, 
progress in technology and other fields of biomedical research have advanced the potential for 
develo pment of new diagnostics and treatments for a wide range of diseases, opening a door of 
opportunity in translational science.  
Step 3.  Medical advances arise from rigorous testing of new strategies for recognizing and intervening 
on disease processes, whet her intervention occurs before it manifests (prevention) or after it takes hold 
(treatment).  Clinical research  is patient -oriented research that is conducted with human subjects 
(studies that involve direct interaction between investigators and human subje cts or the use of material 
of human origin, such as tissues, specimens, and data that retain information that would allow the 
investigator to readily ascertain the identity of the subject).  Clinical research includes clinical trials, 
behavioral and observa tional studies, and the testing and refinement of new technologies.  
Clinical trials, a crucial subset of clinical research, provide  the best method to determine whether 
diagnostics and interventions are safe and effective in people and to assess side effe cts or other 
complications.  There are many different types of trials that are designed to answer specific research 
questions about a biomedical or behavioral intervention.  For example, treatment trials might test 
experimental drugs or devices, new combinat ions of drugs, innovative approaches to surgery or 
radiation therapy, or behavioral interventions such as exercise training or medication adherence.  
Prevention trials test the effectiveness of approaches to prevent diseases or other adverse health 
conditio ns, or to keep them from recurring.  Comparative effectiveness research entails real -world 
comparisons of known interventions.  Screening and diagnostic trials are conducted to find better ways 
to detect or diagnose diseases or conditions.  Finally, quality -of-life trials (or supportive care trials) 
 36 explore ways to improve people’s comfort and ability to continue the activities of daily life even as they 
deal with chronic illnesses or approach the end of life.  
Additionally, NIH supports clinical and translati onal studies unlikely to garner substantial investment by 
other sources because of insufficient financial incentives.  For example, studies that address rare 
diseases are unlikely to be conducted by for -profit entities because of the small number of patient s that 
will make use of new interventions.  
Step 4.  In order for evidence -based research to have an impact  on public health, NIH must ensure that 
new diagnostics and interventions reach the populations that need them most:  patients, families, health 
care providers, and  the broader public health  community . The late (postclinical) translational stage  
takes results from studies in humans and optimizes them to have broad applicability.  For example, NIH 
supports research that will identify factors that enhance access to and implementation of new 
interventions.  Studies in this area include the development and testing of novel models and methods to 
best implement newly discovered interventions in order to reach diverse groups and populations (e.g., 
racial/ethnic g roups, rural populations).  The focus of health services research is on optimizing the health 
care delivery system to reflect the latest medical advances.   
Step 5.  As an important part of NIH’s mission, each IC engages in a broad -based effort to ensure that  
scientific findings are communicated rapidly and clearly to the public.  However, simply communicating 
scientific breakthroughs and the availability of new treatments does not assure that they will be 
adopted in common medical practice.  Nor does simply com municating research results ensure that 
these results will be used to inform policy making. In addition to its communication efforts, NIH works 
with many partners to bring the rich evidence base of NIH research into clinical and community practice , 
both in  terms of treatment and prevention, and in policy -making that affects public health.  These 
partnerships include all those engaged in improving health and reducing the burdens of disease, 
including many federal partners both within HHS (e.g., FDA, CDC) and outside the Department (e.g., 
Veteran’s Administration, Department of Defense).  NIH also partners with non -governmental agencies, 
scientific organizations, patient advocacy groups, and healthcare delivery systems.  These partnerships  
provide the American pu blic with a healthcare system that will enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce 
the burdens of illness and disability .  
Step 6.  As mentioned above, the course of NIH research is not a true continuum, because it does not 
necessarily progress stepwise, nor  does it move in only one direction.  All areas of biomedical and 
behavioral research, from basic to translational to clinical, inform and influence other areas.  Basic 
research scientists provide clinicians with new tools for use with patients, and clinical  researchers make 
new observations about the nature and progression of disease that often produce feedback to stimulate 
new basic investigations.  Research on new outreach approaches and the comparative effectiveness of 
prevention and treatment strategies n ot only address the feasibility of the strategies themselves, but in 
turn inform the development of future interventions.  
In the process of translating basic research into clinical practice, NIH supports the development of 
research technologies, which pro vide innovative tools that are used at multiple points  in the continuum 
 37 and often provide the means for an exchange of information.  With continued advancements in high -
throughput methods, computing technologies that rapidly analyze increasing amounts of da ta, and 
inter -related bioinformatics platforms, NIH researchers across the spectrum  are able to  share 
technologies that were only dreamed of a few years ago.  
  
 38 Identifying Public Health  Needs – Epidemiology   
The mission of NIH, along with the rest of the Public Health Service (PHS), is to address ongoing and 
newly emerging public health needs.  In-depth understanding and monitoring of public health is 
therefore a vital function of the PHS.  NIH works in concert with other PHS agencies (e.g., C enters for 
Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] to identify and monitor public health needs through its support of 
epidemiological studies ). Epidemiological studies examine factors that contribute to health and disease 
in human populations using a broad range of appro aches.  Persons or groups can be followed over time 
in longitudinal studies, or a snapshot of information can be collected at a single point in time.  Studies 
can be done retrospectively, examining outcomes that have already occurred and factors that may hav e 
contributed to health or disease, or they can be done prospectively, by beginning to monitor a 
population of interest before a particular disease -related outcome occurs.  Many epidemiological studies 
are observational in nature, collecting information abo ut and comparing groups —called cohorts —made 
up of individuals who share a characteristic of interest (e.g., tobacco use, age, educational status).  
Population studies are another type of epidemiological research, aimed at providing a better 
understanding of  populations —how they change in size, composition, and distribution; the complex 
social, economic, and cultural factors that cause such changes; and the consequences of population 
change for health and well -being at the individual and societal levels.  
Epidemiological research is a critical part of the activities undertaken to fulfill the NIH mission of 
pursuing fundamental knowledge of living systems and applying that knowledge to extend healthy life 
and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.  Epidem iological research is important for investigating 
all types of disease, and draws on expertise from a wide range of disciplines; thus, it is not surprising 
that virtually all NIH ICs are involved with epidemiological research in some capacity. For example,  NLM 
supports research to develop advanced, informatics -based, surveillance systems that monitor 
population health from a variety of sources ranging from formal clinical data to informal rumor -based 
surveillance  as an innovative means for conducting public  health surveillance.  
As part of the continuum from basic to applied research, epidemiological studies often test the findings 
of laboratory or clinical research at the population level.  For example, animal studies demonstrating the 
reproductive and neurological effects of bisphenol A (BPA) —a common component of plastics —have 
prompted large -scale epidemiological studies to ascertain the exposure and health effects of this 
chemical in humans.  Additionally, observations made through epidemiological stud ies often result in the 
formulation of new or modified hypotheses that spur new basic, translational, and clinical studies.  For 
example, epidemiological studies in the 1950s showing that tobacco smoking increases risk of lung 
cancer led to extensive resear ch to identify the carcinogens and mechanisms involved in tobacco -related 
carcinogenesis.  Thus, epidemiological studies are essential for linking results from the bench to the 
patient bedside to the general population.  
The population -based perspective pro vided by epidemiological studies often helps to form a foundation 
for the practical application of scientific knowledge, including  changes in clinical practice and the 
development of public policy.  For example, the Framingham Heart Study, which was initiat ed in 1948, 
 39 linked risk of cardiovascular disease to factors such as high serum cholesterol levels, hypertension, and 
cigarette smoking.  Based on these results, clinicians were able not only to identify patients at high risk 
for cardiovascular disease  but, even more important, to develop interventions that reduce risk . More 
recently, a series of NIH studies revealed an increased risk of cancer following exposure to benzene at 
low levels and documented blood toxicity following exposure levels of under one pa rt per million.46,47 
These data were used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as it  developed a new rule in 
2007 limiting the benzene content in gasoline and adopting new standards for passenger vehicles and 
portable fuel containers to limit emissions of benzene and other hazardous air pollutants.48  
NIH Epidemiological Research Activitie s 
In the area of epidemiological research, NIH often leverages its investment by working with other 
agencies. For example, numerous NIH Institutes collaborate with CDC to collect population -based 
information through CDC’s many surveys. For example, NIDCD c ollaborated with CDC to incorporate 
several measures into CDC surveys to boost knowledge on the prevalence of hearing, taste, and smell 
disorders. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), NIDCD supports a hearing 
component (audiome try testing and related questions on hearing loss and noise exposure in adults ages 
20 to 69) and a chemosenses component that consists of household interview questions with taste and 
smell testing.  
A collaboration between the Department of Defense and NI MH, the  Army Study to Assess Risk and 
Resilience in Service Members (Army STARRS) is the largest study of suicide and mental health among 
military personnel that has ever been undertaken.49 The goal of the five-year project is to identify, as 
rapidly as pos sible, the risk and protective factors that will help the Army develop effective strategies to 
reduce rising suicide rates and to address associated mental health problems among soldiers.  Army 
STARRS’ five components include  historical data collected by th e Army as well as current data being 
collected from soldiers in all phases of Army service.  This research will help inform our understanding of 
suicide in the overall population, leading to more effective prevention and treatment for service 
members and ci vilians alike.  Related to this research, NIMH and the U.S. Marine Corps signed a 
memorandum of agreement in August 2011 to begin collaboration with researchers from the Marine 
Resilience Study.  
Another  example of an intergovernmental collaboration is the Agricultural Health Study , cosponsored by 
two NIH Institutes  (NCI and NIEHS)  and EPA.50 With a cohort of more than 89,000 private and 
commercial pesticide applicators and their spouses, the study is exploring occupational, lifestyle, and 
genetic factors tha t may affect the disease  rates  in farming populations.  Although current research 
suggests that agricultural workers are healthier overall than the general U.S. population, they may have

 40 higher rates of some types of cancer and other conditions including  diabetes, asthma, neurologic 
disease, and reproductive problems.  A recent Agricultural Health Study study showed that private and 
commercial pesticide applicators who  used the common agricultural herbicide atrazine were at 
increased risk of thyroid cancer.51 Another study evaluated the interaction between gene variants which 
have been shown in previous studies to increase prostate cancer risk and pesticide use.  Interactions 
with these variants were observed with the organophosphates insecticides  fonofos, terbu fos, 
coumaphos , and phorate and the pyrethroid, permethrin.52 
Given its stable budget and long existence, NIH has been able to invest in a number of important 
longitudinal studies.  For example, NIA supports a robust portfolio of longitudinal demographic and  
economic research, including studies to estimate the health and economic consequences of aging.  The 
Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a premier source of data on the health and socioeconomic 
circumstances of older Americans, including information about  retirement, income, pensions and 
health.53 It provides uniquely rich, nationally representative longitudinal data for the community of 
scientific and policy researchers who study the health, economics, demography, sociology, and 
psychology of aging, creating opportunities for new types of interdisciplinary research.  Funds from the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA) facilitated expansion of the study, including 
genotyping DNA samples from participants and doubling the minority sample  to faci litate research on 
vulnerable populations . HRS has also become a model for  an international collection of aging studies 
that support cross -national comparative research.  
Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the U.S., exceeded only by heart di sease. In the 
U.S., cancer accounts for nearly 1 of every 4 deaths.  Childhood cancers are rare, representing less than 1 
percent of all new cancer diagnoses.  The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer,54 released 
by NCI , CDC, American Cancer So ciety , and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries 
in March 2011, and reporting on a data period of 2003 –2007, found for the first time that lung cancer 
death rates decreased in women, more than a decade after rates began dropping in me n. The report 
was informed by the NCI SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) Cancer Statistics review.  The 
review was last updated in November 2011 and covers 1975 –2008.  
NIDDK’s The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY)  study was established to 
identify potential environmental factors, including the infectious agents, dietary factors, or other 
environmental conditions that trigger type 1 diabetes in genetically susceptible individuals. The TEDDY 
study has completed enrol lment of over 8,000 high -risk newborns and is collecting biosamples for 
analysis to identify potential triggers of type 1 diabetes. Children enrolled in the study are developing 
autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes at predicted rates, indicating that those at risk can be accurately 
identified, and that the study is on track to make a major contribution. Identification of an infectious 
agent that triggers autoimmunity could lead to a vaccine to protect against type 1 diabetes. Or, if dietary

 41 factors are identifi ed that protect from or contribute to the development of the disease, changes in 
infant feeding practices could be recommended. NIAID, NICHD, and NIEHS also participate in this study.   
The National Children’s Study (NCS) was mandated by Congress in the Chi ldren’s Health Act of 2000.  
Beginning in FY 2001, NICHD, designated as the lead agency, began planning for the study  in 
collaboration with other federal partners . In FY 2007, Congress add ed new funding for the study through 
the Office of the Director, NIH,  and has appropriated funds every year since then.  The NCS is a 
longitudinal birth cohort observational study55 with the goal of improving the health and well -being of 
children and to identify antecedents of healthy adulthood by examining the effects of a b road range of 
environmental influences and biological factors.  The NCS will produce an unprecedented amount of 
information about children’s health and will provide a foundation for analyzing factors that contribute to 
growth, development, health, and disea se to guide future science and policy.   
The NCS Vanguard Study, a pilot study to test design and proc edur es aspects of the Main study, was 
launched in January 2009 and has already provided a rich source of data to guide the Main NCS Study.  
NIH announce d funding opportunities in FY 2012 for continuation of the Vanguard Study and will begin 
recruiting the targeted 100,000 newborns who will be the subjects of the Main Study.   
Initiated in 2011, the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study  is the first large -scale 
NIH-FDA collaboration on tobacco regulatory research since Congress granted FDA the authority to 
regulate tobacco products under the Family Smoking Protection and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA  in 
2009 ). It is a national, longitudinal co hort study that will follow an estimated 59,000 adults and youth 
(12 to 18 years old) to assess susceptibility to tobacco use, patterns of use, risk perceptions, and 
resultant health impacts. The sample will include both males and females and persons of di verse racial, 
ethnic, and cultural backgrounds. Data collection is currently slated to begin in fall 2013, with plans for 
four or more annual data collection waves.  Outcomes will inform current and future regulatory options 
for the FDA to protect public he alth, including setting tobacco product standards and communicating 
the risks of tobacco use to the general public.   
Investments in the past continue to pay off.  NIH has been investing in epidemiological research for most 
of its history, and some of this r esearch involves longitudinal studies that have been ongoing for 
decades.  Data collected from these studies continue to advance our understanding of disease and 
health in new and exciting ways and form the foundation for extraordinary opportunities in biom edical 
research today.   
The Framingham Heart Study provides an example of research that leverages past and current 
investments in population -based studies to study the basis of disease. The original cohort of 
Framingham residents was first established in 1 948 and has since been complemented by cohorts of 
their children and grandchildren. The DNA of more than 9,000 Framingham participants from all three 
                                                 
55 In July 2012, the NCS Proposed Sampling Strategy: Main Study  document was released to structure discussions 
about the future of the NCS’s sampling design for the National Children’s Study Advisory Committee: 
http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about /organization/advisorycommittee/Pages/Proposed%20Sampling%20Str
ategy%20Main%20Study%20%28July%202012%29.pdf . The NCS is proposing a multi -layered cohort approach 
that involves birth, prenatal, and preconception cohorts.  
 42 generations has been analyzed as part of an initiative called the SNP Health Association Resource 
(SHARe).  The genetic data, along with information about major disease risk factors (e.g., systolic blood 
pressure, cholesterol levels, cigarette use), have been added to the National Center for Biotechnology 
Information’s (NCBI) database of Genotypes and Phenotype s (dbGaP) and are available for use by 
researchers interested in investigating genetic contributors to disease.   
NIH-supported studies also have been used to inform the decisions of policymakers and assess the 
short - and long -term effects of policies on he alth or health -related behaviors.  For example, in 1975, 
NIDA launched the Monitoring the Future (MTF) project, a study that tracks drug use and related  
attitudes and behaviors of adolescents and young adults.  MTF annually surveys approximately 50,000 
stude nts in grades 8, 10, and 12, and follow -up is conducted every two years with a subset of individuals 
from each graduating class until they reach age 30.  MTF data have informed policy discussions on 
substance abuse and have been used by the White House Offi ce of National Drug Control Policy to 
monitor progress toward national health goals.56 For example, when MTF began measuring nonmedical 
use of Vicodin among teens in 2002, it revealed an alarming rate of 1 in 10 high school seniors abusing 
this prescription  pain reliever. This, along with other epidemiological research, has led to several NIDA 
and federal partner initiatives to address this problem.  
A comprehensive understanding of health and disease requires consideration of factors from the 
molecular to th e community level.  Conducting studies in diverse contexts helps to elucidate how these 
contributors converge to influence health and also ensures that insights gained will benefit various 
populations.  NIH supports a number of studies in the U.S. and worldw ide aimed at building a 
comprehensive understanding of health and disease, with the goal of identifying new and more effective 
approaches for prevention and treatment.  Three examples —the Environmental Polymorphism Registry 
(EPR), the Childhood Autism Risks  from Genetics and Environment (CHARGE) study , and the Multi -Ethnic 
Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) —illustrate NIH’s pursuit to build a comprehensive understanding of 
health and disease.  
To facilitate research on the interactions of genes and the environme nt, NIEHS  launched EPR, in 
collaboration with the University of North Carolina General Clinical Research Center, to collect DNA 
samples from more than 16 ,000 individuals in the greater Research Triangle Park , North Carolina  region 
through local health care  systems, health fairs, study drives, and other means.  This region has a diverse 
population varying in age, ethnicity, economic and educational background, and health status.  A unique 
feature of the EPR is that participants were recruited from two distinct  groups —apparently healthy 
individuals from the general population and patients from area clinics and hospitals.  Individuals in the 
clinic/hospital group had an array of medical conditions, and their inclusion in the EPR increases the 
likelihood of identif ying subjects with both the genetic and clinical characteristics of interest.  Unlike 
anonymous DNA registries, researchers using EPR are able to identify and contact registry participants —
with their consent —for further study, if they are found to have pote ntially significant genetic variants.  
These aspects of the EPR give scientists the flexibility to design follow -up studies, while reducing biases

 43 that can occur in genetic epidemiology studies when subjects are recruited based primarily on their 
observable  clinical or physical traits.  
CDC estimates that about 1 in 88  children has been identified with an autism spectrum disorder .57 CDC’s 
data indicate that ASD prevalence has increased 78  percent  since 2002 . Whether the cause is 
attributable to a change in di agnosis criteria or to genetic or environmental factors is unclear.  Multiple 
factors are likely to be responsible for the increase in prevalence over time.  Since 2006, NIEHS has 
supported the Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment (CHARGE) st udy, an 
epidemiologic investigation of a wide spectrum of chemical and biologic exposures, susceptibility 
factors, and genetic  interactions that may contribute to autism. The study is examining and comparing 
three populations of children: those with autism , those without autism but with developmental delay or 
mental retardation, and typically developing children. In one recent study, scientists demonstrated an 
association between a mother’s living near freeways and major roadways during pregnancy and near 
time of delivery (a surrogate for air pollution) and the risk of having a child with autism.58  
Research has shown that factors such as genetic background, geographic location, socioeconomic status, 
and cultural traits  may  contribute to variations in disease  risk among different populations.  This 
observation has important implications for biomedical research, as results in one population may not 
necessarily apply to another.  Thus, it is important to include study participants with diverse backgrounds 
and char acteristics to increase the likelihood that insights gained through study findings will benefit all 
groups of people.  In this regard, NIH is supporting the Multi -Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ( MESA ), a 
multicenter epidemiological study of cardiovascular disease in 6,900 men and women from four ethnic 
groups —white, African American, Hispanic, and Americans of Chinese  ancestry . This study, which began 
in 1999 and is funded through 2015, has measured and compared the value of chest computed 
tomography (CT), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, carotid ultrasound, arterial compliance, 
endothelial function, biochemical markers, and genetic and environmental factors for predicting the 
development of cardiovascular disease.  In one recent finding , researchers used MESA data to confirm 
that CT measurements of coronary calcium, previously shown to predict coronary heart disease among 
white populations, are effective predictors in African Americans, Hispanics, and Americans of Chinese  
ancestry  as well.59  
Bridging the g ap between research and application requires the contributions of numerous scientists 
with diverse expertise.  Therefore, NIH fosters a culture of collaboration  by encouraging researchers to 
build teams to conduct complex studies and analyses as well as pro moting collaborations within NIH and 
between NIH and other federal agencies.  
The Cohort Consortium is an example of an NIH initiative that encourages a team approach to 
understand the role of gene -gene and gene -environment interactions in the etiology of c ancer.  The

 44 collaboration allows Consortium partners to share data from 43 cohorts composed  of more than 4 
million people from diverse populations.  Each cohort contains extensive information on known or 
suspected risk factors and biospecimens collected pre - and post -diagnosis.  The pre -diagnostic specimens 
provide a valuable resource for studies of cancer etiology and early detection.  Researchers can correlate 
changes in molecular profiles associated with the onset of different types of disease, thereby provi ding 
valuable insights into the actual mechanisms of human carcinogenesis.  
The 27 NIH ICs collectively house expertise on a broad spectrum of diseases, populations, and research 
support methods.  Large -scale epidemiological studies provide an ideal opportun ity for researchers from 
the various NIH components to work together on innovative studies that examine diverse factors 
contributing to public health and disease.  For example, the Hispanic Community Health Study, which is 
sponsored by six NIH Institutes ( NHLBI, NIMHD,  NIDCD, NIDCR,  NINDS, and NIDDK) and the NIH Office of 
Dietary Supplements, includes 16,000 persons of Hispanic/Latino descent to identify factors that 
influence a wide variety of diseases  and conditions such as heart disease, asthma, sleep dis orders, 
diabetes, hearing loss (including noise -induced hearing loss), tinnitus, and cognitive impairment.60 It is 
the largest long -term epidemiological study of health and disease ever conducted in people of 
Hispanic/Latino heritage living in the U.S.  Particular attention will be given to the role of cultural 
adaptation and disparities in the prevalence and development of disease.  The insights gained from this 
study will be invaluable because the U.S. Hispanic population, already the largest minority popula tion in 
the country, is expected to triple by 2050.  
Conclusion  
Epidemiological studies are fundamental to NIH’s mission, in that they play a key role in identifying 
public health needs, and they are essential to efforts to bridge the results of basic, translational, and 
clinical studies to practical applications such as clinical practice and public policy. Many NIH 
epidemiological studies have had substantial influence on public health, with current investments likely 
to follow suit. This success is due  to a number of factors, including investment in long -term studies, 
pursuit of a comprehensive view of disease, and promotion of a culture of cooperation.

 45 Basic Research   
Basic research is a major force driving pr ogress across the biomedical and  behavioral sciences and is 
paramount in uncovering the fundamental principles of biology, and ultimately, the key to our 
understanding of health and disease . Investments in basic biomedical research make it possible to 
understand the causes of disease ons et and progression, design preventive interventions, develop 
better diagnostic tests, and discover new treatments and cures.  From the incremental advances in our 
understanding of a given disease, to the groundbreaking discoveries that revolutionize our app roaches 
for treating or preventing it, investments in basic research have  yielded  and will continue to yield 
inestimable rewards and benefits to public health.  Therefore , fostering a broad basic research portfolio 
is critical for the NIH mission.  
Advances in Basic Research Form Building Blocks for Clinical Discovery and Improvements in Public 
Health  
Basic biomedical research seeks to understand how finely tuned biological and behavioral processes 
work together in harmony and, how this harmony at multiple le vels of analysis  can break down, forming 
the basis of disease.  For example, a t the molecular level, scientists are interested in understanding how 
biological macromolecules —proteins, nucleic acids, sugars, and lipids —carry out cellular processes.  At 
the ce llular level, researchers  are focused on understanding how cells sense and respond to their 
environment. And at the behavioral level, researchers are focused on how individual organisms react to 
and act upon their environment.  
Basic research is encompassed  in the missions of all NIH ICs , and progress often requires 
interdisciplinary approaches to develop new technologies, improve methods of data analysis, and 
provide insight on fundamental disease pathway s. NIH fosters collaborations that span all of the 
traditional and emerging disciplines of the life, physical, engineering, computer, behavioral, and social 
sciences.  
Progress in basic research generally does not follow a linear path from test tubes to cell culture to 
animal models.  Instead, it tends to  resu lt from a continuum of collaborative interactions between 
research groups across multiple disciplines.  The discovery of a gene that causes a disease state in mice 
may spark the creation of research programs to investigate the structural basis for the interaction of the  
gene’s protein product with a partner molecule . Other  studies may  elucidate a novel molecular pathway 
that the  protein and its partner molecule  regulate and thereby  generate a biological response.  
Conversely, the visualization of a previ ously unknown protein structure may provide remarkable insight 
into the protein’s function and generate a hypothesis for how a particular gene mutation may generate 
a relevant disease model in mice.  Regardless of the path taken to arrive at an incremental advance or a 
groundbreaking discovery, basic research lays the foundation for clinical advances that improve public 
health.  At the heart of every clinical discovery is a body of fundamental basic knowledge that provides 
the impetus for setting forth a clin ical hypothesis and generating the information required to safely and 
ethically proceed to testing in humans.  
 46 NIH supports a comprehensive portfolio of basic research aimed at understanding fundamental life 
processes.  The results of such studies provide i nsights on fundamental aspects of biology  and behavior  
and lay the foundation for other studies that will lead to ways to extend healthy life and reduce the 
burdens of illness and disability.  In fact, each new finding serves as a building block for establi shing a 
deeper understanding of human health and disease.  NIH supports general basic research, as well as 
basic research focused within a specific area or context.  
Model Organisms and Systems  
Basic research is concerned with advancing our understanding of  human health and disease; however, 
for a number of reasons —both ethical and practical —many fundamental aspects of biology cannot be 
studied in people . Therefore, scientists often carry out basic research in "model systems" that are easier  
to work with in precisely defined and controlled setting s. Basic research using model systems and 
organisms has provided the foundation of knowledge about human growth and development, behavior, 
the maintenance of health,  and development of disease.  Research on bacteria, yeast, insects, worms, 
fish, rodents, primates, and even plants has shown that the basic operating principles are nearly the 
same in all living organisms.  Therefore, a finding made in fruit flies or mice may shed light on a biological 
process in humans  and thereby lead to new methods for maintaining health and diagnosing and treating 
disease.  
When scientists discover that a particular gene is associated with a disease in humans, one of the first 
things they typically do is find out what that gene does in a  model organism.  NIH supports the 
development and distribution of collections of animal s with defects in known genes.  They can be used 
to investigate how a particular gene found to be associated with a particular disease affects 
development overall and dis ease susceptibility and progression.  For example, the NIH -sponsored 
National Resource for Zebrafish, Drosophila Stock Center , and Caenorhabditis Genetics Center , provide 
the research community with well -characterized wild -type (normal) and mutant zebrafish , fruit flies, and 
roundworms, respectively.  
Model organisms are often especially useful for understanding features of disease  that have similar 
underlying molecular causes.  For example, protein -clumping defects are common to several 
neurological disorders  such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases.  Scientists can 
recreate these cellular defects in yeast, worms, and fruit flies, and then translate the findings into 
knowledge to benefit people with those diseases.  
In addition to supporting individual studies of model organisms, NIH supports the development of a 
wide range of research models, particularly marine invertebrates and lower vertebrates, and the 
identification and development of new and improved animal and non -animal models for the study of 
human diseases.  
Molecular Mechanisms  and Pathways  
In the human body, all biological components —from individual genes to entire organs —work together 
to promote normal development and sustain health.  This amazing feat of biological teamwork is made  
 47 possible by an array of intricate and interconnected pathways that facilitate communication among 
genes, molecules, and cells.  While some pathways have already been discovered, many more remain to 
be found.  Further research also is needed to understand ho w these pathways are integrated in humans 
and other complex organisms, as well as to determine how disturbances in the m may lead to disease 
and what might be done to restore disturbed pathways to their normal functions.  
NIH supports a broad spectrum of res earch  to improv e the molecular -level understanding of 
fundamental biological processes and discovering approaches to its control.  By uncovering how certain 
molecules function in key signaling pathway s, scientists may be able to develop therapies that targe t 
these molecules for the treatment of a variety of devastating disorders.  The goals of research supported 
by NIH in this area include an improved understanding of drug action; pharmacogenetics —the study of 
genetic  mechanisms underlying individual response s to drugs; new methods and targets for drug 
discovery; advances in natural products synthesis; an enhanced understanding of biological catalys ts; a 
greater knowledge of metabolic regulation and fundamental physiological processes; and the 
integration and application of basic physiological, pharmacological, and biochemical research to clinical 
issues.  
Molecular  and Cell  Biology  
Growth and development is a life -long process that has many phases and functions.  Much of the 
research in this area focuses on cell ular, molecular, and developmental biology, to build understanding 
of the mechanisms and interactions that guide a single fertilized egg through its development into a n 
adult organism.  The eventual goal of these studies is to improve the diagnosis, treatme nt, and 
prevention of human genetic and developmental disorders and diseases.  
All cells go through  different stages in the cell cycle . A new  cell is formed  when its parent cell divides in 
two; it carries out its biological functions; it reproduces by div iding, often dozens of times; and then it 
dies.  Underlying these milestones are regular cycles.  Progress through each cycle is governed by a 
precisely choreographed biochemical cascade involving a repertoire of molecules.  For the past several 
decades, NIH -supported researchers have conducted detailed studies of molecules that guide cells 
through division and development, methodically unraveling their biochemical identities and properties.  
Scientists have examined the molecules’ ebb and flow throughout the c ell cycle and their eventual 
demise as they are chemically chewed up when their job is done —until generated again for the next cell 
cycle.  
As for most life processes, when the biochemical choreography of cells goes awry, the result can be 
disastrous.  Glitches in the cell cycle can lead to a host of diseases, most notably cancer, which can be 
defined simply as uncontrolled cell division and the failure of programmed cell death.  Scientists are 
poised to take advantage of the wealth of basic research on the c ell cycle.  They are testing scores of 
potential anticancer drugs that aim to bolster or block cell cycle molecules.  For instance, researchers are 
harnessing their knowledge of the cyclical fluctuations in cell cycle molecules to predict the 
aggressiveness of a cancer and to tailor treatments.  
 
 48 Stem Cells  
Stem cells have the remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types in the body during 
early life and growth.  In addition, in many tissues they serve as a n internal repair system, dividing 
essentially without limit to replenish other cells throughout life . When a stem cell divides, each new cell 
has the potential either to remain a stem cell or to become another type of cell with a more specialized 
function, such as a muscle cell, a red blood cell, or a brain cell.  
Given their  unique regenerative abilities, stem cells  that are  directed to differentiate into specific cell 
types offer the possibility of a renewable source of replacement cells and tissues to treat diseases such 
as diabetes, heart disease, vision loss, and Parkinson’s disease.  Today, donated organs and tissues may 
be used to replace ailing or destroyed tissue, but the need for transplantable tissues and organs far 
outweighs the available supply . Much research is underway  to understand how to use products 
developed from stem  cells as therapies to treat disease.  
NIH h as funded numerous  research projects on the basic biology of human embryonic stem cells (hESC s) 
and has developed initiatives to support fundamental research on a new kind of stem cell, called an 
induced pluripotent stem (iPS)  cell. iPS cells are reprogram med from adult cells to a pluripotent state 
remarkably like hESC. These reprogrammed cells offer a powerful approach to generating patient -
specific stem cells that ultimately may be used in the clinic.  NIH has seen an increase in the number of 
investigator -initiated research applications using iPS  cells, and NIH support of this research area is 
growing.  
The NIH Common Fund support ed the establishment of an NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine (NIH 
CRM) within the NIH IRP to serve as a resource for the scientific community, providing stem cells and 
supporting protocols and standard operating procedures used to derive, culture, and dif ferentiate the 
stem cells into different cell types.  The program is intended to accelerate the development of cell -based 
therapies for repairing or replacing tissue damaged by disease or injury.  Among various potential 
activities, NIH CRM is help ing standa rdize research results across different laboratories by facilitating 
access to a set of well -characterized stem cell control and reporter lines.  In addition, the center is 
negotiating uniform iPS cell deposit and distribution agreements with major human ce ll and tissue 
banking facilities for NIH researchers that can be more widely adopted.  The NIH CRM Director has 
established numerous domestic and international collaborations.  In addition to these efforts, a number 
of intramural iPS cell pilot research proj ects have been funded to stimulate iPS cell research at the NIH 
and to help translate findings in to the clinic, in part by serving as “test cases” for newly developed 
standardized procedures and resources.  
Immunobiology and Inflammation  
The human immune system is composed of a network of specialized cells that act together to defend 
the body against infection by organisms such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites, and to prevent cancer.  
Unfortunately, poorly regulated immune responses can result in the dev elopment of immune -mediated 
diseases that include asthma, allergy, and autoimmune syndromes such as rheumatoid arthritis, 
multiple sclerosis, type 1  diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease s. Furthermore, the immune system  
 49 of transplant recipients mounts a n attack on donated  organs and tissues, which imposes the need for 
strong drugs to prevent rejection.  The lack of an immune response also can be very deleterious, 
increasing susceptibility to infection.  Immunodeficiency disorders can be caused by inherited  flaws in 
the immune system, as is the case with primary immunodeficiency diseases, and by pathogens such as 
HIV that destroy immune cells.  
Although a great deal has been learned about how the immune system operates in both health and 
disease, there is sti ll more to be learned that will lead to improved and novel methods to prevent or 
treat human disease.  Thus, NIH supports basic science studies in immunobiology (the biology of the 
immune system) to provide a pipeline of potential new treatments and vaccine s. Research in basic 
immunobiology focuses on the structural and functional properties of cells of the immune system and 
the proteins they secrete, the interactions of immune components with other physiological systems, and 
the processes by which appropriate regulation of the immune system is achieved to protect the body 
while still preventing immune attack on a person’s own tissues.  
Inflammation is mediated  by molecules secreted by immune cells.  Acute inflammation is triggered by 
damage to tissue or cells, t ypically by pathogens or injury.  Chronic inflammation has been implicated in 
the etiology of multiple diseases, including asthma, atherosclerosis, cancer, cardiovascular disorders, 
and neurodegenerative diseases.  Although significant breakthroughs have occ urred in our 
understanding of inflammation, research is needed to further understand inflammatory processes.  NIH 
is funding research to uncover as -yet-unknown immune mechanisms and mediators of inflammation as 
well as genetic factors, environmental trigger s, and the relationship of inflammation to disease.  
One of NIH’s activities in this arena is the Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and 
Inflammation (CHI), a trans -NIH intramural initiative launched in 2008 to study the human immune 
system.  Integra ted teams of physicians and basic scientists are organized by CHI to perform research 
into immune pathophysiologies, the role of inflammation in a wide variety of disorders, and the 
translation of new knowledge into improvements in diagnosis and treatment of disease.  
"-Omics" Approaches  
“-Omics” approaches characterize cellular molecules, such as genes, proteins, metabolites, 
carbohydrates, and lipids, and allow comparisons to be made between species and among individuals of 
a species. Technological advanc es in “-omics”  have fundamentally changed the conduct of molecular 
biology, making it possible to rapidly obtain information on the entire complement of biomolecules 
within a cell or tissue.  For example, it is now possible to measure the expression of all genes 
(transcriptome) in a cell or tissue in less than a day, something that would have taken months , if not 
years, just a decade ago.  These advances have led to the accumulation of large datasets that scientists 
sift through using statistical methods, or bioinformatics, to understand how networks of cellular 
components work in concert to produce a state of normal health and to identify the key players that go 
awry as a cause or result of disease.  For example, scientists may now examine the entire genome of  an 
organism to identify genes associated with a particular trait (e.g., susceptibility to disease, 
developmental stage, physical trait such as height) or to compare the proteome (i.e., the entire 
 50 complement of proteins) of a specific cell type with those of another (e.g., Alzheimer’s brain cells vs. 
normal brain cells).  This type of research is sometimes referred to as "hypothesis -limited ," because 
investigators cast a technological net to obtain information on the entire catalog of biomolecules within 
a cell or tissue before they set out to prove or disprove a specific hypothesis.  
NIH has made a significant investment in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other types of " -
omics" that seek to catalog a specific class or type of biomolecule, as well  as bioinformatics and 
computational biology.  This investment has led to an explosive growth in biological information, a rich 
resource that can be mined for clues about fundamental life processes, susceptibility to disease, and 
disease outcomes.  The delug e of genomic information has, in turn, generated a pressing need  for 
computerized databases to store, organize, and index the data and for specialized tools to view and 
analyze the data.  NCBI is charged with creating automated systems for storing and analy zing knowledge 
about molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics; facilitating the use of such databases and software 
by the research and medical community; coordinating efforts to gather biotechnology information both 
nationally and internationally; and  performing research into advanced methods of computer -based 
information processing for analyzing the structure and function of biologically important molecules.   
Genomics  
As exemplified by the Human Genome Project, the field of genomics aims to understand  how the entire 
genome, or genetic composition, of a cell or an organism contributes to define development, 
physiology, and disease.  With a map of the human genome in hand, NIH continues to support research 
to understand how variations in the genetic seque nce among individuals contribute to health and 
disease.  Genomics is the study of an organism’s entire genome —the complete assembly of DNA, or in 
some cases RNA (ribonucleic acid) —that transmits the instructions for developing and operating a living 
organis m. Genomic research focuses not just on individual genes but also on the functioning of the 
entire genome as a network and, importantly, on how this network interacts with environmental factors 
to influence health and cause disease.  Genomics is a new and challenging discipline that is increasingly 
used in virtually every field of biological and medical research.  
DNA is made up of four chemical compounds called " nucleobases ." Four distinct nucleobases are found 
in the DNA of all organisms: adenine, thymine,  guanine, and cytosine —denoted by the letters A, T, G, 
and C respectively.  These nucleobases  are attached to sugar molecules and phosphate groups to form 
strands. Two parallel strands are entwined in the form of a double helix, held together by nucleotide 
pairs . Each nucleotide  in one strand links to the same partner on the other strand : A pairs with T , C pairs 
with G —forming what is called  a "base pair."  The human genome consists of about 3 billion base pairs, 
packaged in 23 sets of chromosomes  that are  wrapped extremely tightly into the nucleus of virtually 
every cell in the body.  Identifying the base pairs —and thus the letters —and the order in which they 
appear on any stretch of DNA is called "sequencing" that segment.  
DNA’s double helical structure was d iscovered in 1953.  Fifty years later, t he human genome was fully 
sequenced by a n NHGRI -led, multinational effort called the Human Genome Project, which lasted 13 
years and completed its work  ahead of schedule and under budget.  The sequencing of the human 
 51 genome generated immense scientific excitement. It provided a new means of analyzing the functions of 
cells, tissues, and systems in the body and offered new tools for understanding the causes of disease.  It 
laid the foundation for broad new scientific disc iplines such as proteomics, the study of the structure 
and function of all the proteins produced by the body (in response to instructions carried by the genes).  
Recent studies have demonstrated that the genome contains more information than can be interpre ted 
from just its sequence.  It is more complex, more variable in its structure, and more complicated in its 
internal interactions than anyone imagined just a few years ago.  Almost every human disease or 
disorder has a genetic component and an environmental  component.  The genetic component s for some 
heritable diseases, such as sickle cell disease or cystic fibrosis, result from mutations in single genes —
changes that disrupt the function of the protein they encode.  However, in most diseases the role of 
genes and the environment is more complicated.  Some diseases arise as a result of spontaneous gene 
mutations that occur during a person’s lifetime; others are caused by complex cascades of changes in 
gene expression triggered, perhaps, by environmental factors.  Differences as small as one letter in our 3 
billion pairs of DNA letters can cause disease directly or cause a person to respond differently to 
particular pathogens or drugs.  Multiple genetic and environmental factors play a role in myriad common 
diseases,  such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and asthma, but for no common disease have all the 
genes involved yet been identified.  
Educational resources to help the public understand genomics, including multimedia presentations, are 
available on the NIH Web site.61 
As a result of the overwhelming influence of the genome on human health, virtually every NIH IC now 
engages in genome -related research.  Like many NIH ICs, NCI supports a huge array of gene -oriented 
projects, including Genome -Wide Association Studies  (GWAS) —in effect, full -body DNA scans —that 
recently detected new genetic factors involved in breast, prostate, and colon cancers.  The first 
successful application of GWAS for age -related macular degeneration (AMD) identified an entirely new 
molecular path way.  In 2010, an NEI -led international consortium combined data from multiple GWAS on 
AMD to identify many new genetic loci. Similarly, in FY 2009, NEI conducted the largest glaucoma 
genetics study to date and identified two new highly significant pathways  involved in glaucoma . Over 
the past four  years, NHLBI and NIGMS have sponsored a research consortium that combined both 
genetic and clinical data to devise a computer algorithm for setting the proper dose of the blood -thinner 
warfarin, commonly prescribed  for heart patients and others , the physical response to which is strongly 
influenced by genetic factors .62 A major clinical trial began in early 2009 to test whether that new 
algorithm is better than the current trial -and-error method.   
NIH researchers and  grant recipients also have increased the pace of sequencing other nonhuman 
genomes.  Full sequences of nearly 200 organisms now have been completed or are underway.  
Comparing the human genome to the genomes of other creatures, including insects and even si ngle -
celled organisms, reveals stretches of DNA that have remained similar over millions of years of

 52 evolution.  These "conserved" sequences are thought to play an important role in the functioning of a 
living organism, even if scientists do not yet know wh at that role is.  
Genes themselves, the "coding regions" of DNA that direct cells to make particular proteins, account for 
only about 2 percent of the human genome.  Locating the noncoding but functional sequences 
throughout the rest of the genome is the mai n mission of the ENCODE (ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements)  
research  consortium.  NIH also has pressed ahead with the Model ENCODE project (modENCODE) to 
identify all the functional elements in the genomes of two hugely important and widely used laboratory 
model organisms —the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the roundworm Caenorhab ditis elegans.63 
The strategy is to identify genomic mechanisms in these model organisms, which will elucidate novel 
research directions for human genomic and other researchers.  
DNA sequencing and analysis projects serve to advance technology and bioinforma tics that may soon 
bring revolutionary improvements to the practice of medicine.  The development of new methods to 
sequence DNA faster and more cheaply is the central goal of some NIH -sponsored projects . As NIH 
continues to fund technological innovation in  this area, the costs continue to fall remarkably.  Soon, 
when a patient’s full genome can be sequenced for less than the cost of other routine medical tests, and 
ongoing genomic research programs have further broadened and deepened our understanding of the  
genome’s functioning , we may well be approaching a new era in medical care . The practice of medicine 
will move beyond a one -size-fits-all approach , and the promise of personalized medicine will be realized.   
NHGRI’s  1000 Genomes Project aims to discover a lmost all human genetic variants  in order  to support 
studies relating genetic variation to health and disease.  The project is sequencing the genomes of 2,661 
people from 26 populations around the world and releasing the data publicly.  The sequence data wil l 
allow the project to identify variants ranging from single DNA base differences among people up to large 
insertions or deletions in their genomes.  Many of these variants contribute to an increased risk for 
particular diseases or to differences in drug re sponse.  Researchers will use these data to map the genes 
and variants affecting disease and to study the genetics of human populations.  
Research in the area of pharmacogenomics seeks to understand the inherited variations in genes that 
dictate drug respons e and explores the ways these variations can be used to predict whether a patient 
will have a beneficial response to a drug, a poor or adverse response, or no response at all.  By 
understanding the differences in the genetic basis of drug responses scientis ts hope to enable doctors to 
prescribe the drugs and doses best suited for each individual.  The mission of the NIH Pharmacogenetics 
Research Network (PGRN) is to better understand the genetic basis for variable drug responses and 
identify safe and effectiv e drug therapies designed for individual patients.  
Most of the genome research that will lead to  direct clinical implications, improve our understanding of 
human health, and change clinical practice, still lies ahead.  Over the next decade, research will unlock 
the true potential of this foundational work, leading scientists closer to better means for preventing, 
diagnosing, and treating disease.

 53 When the Human Genome Project was completed in 2003, the cost to sequence a human genome was 
more than $10 mill ion. NHGRI understood that human genome sequencing, far from being over, was 
just beginning . Conduct ing the research needed to dissect genomic contributions to disease  would 
require  hundreds of thousands to millions of human sequences . Lowering the cost became  a high 
priority , so NHGRI set a goal of reducing the cost of sequencing a human genome to $1,000 in 10 years, 
with an intermediate goal of $100,000 in 5 years.  Since launching the Advanced DNA Sequencing 
Technology program in 2004, NHGRI has committed  more than $150 million to 60 research teams and 
supported a wide variety of scientific approaches.  By 2009, NHGRI -supported research had contributed 
to achieving the five -year goal.  The resulting technologies have revolutionized the study of human 
genetic  variation in studies ranging from the 1000 Genomes Project to The Cancer Genome Atlas.  The 
focus of the sequencing technology program has shifted toward achieving human genome sequencing 
for $1,000 or less, which will offer the possibility of using genome  sequence information in a routine 
healthcare setting.  
Using DNA from tissue samples, genome -wide association studies  scan and compare entire genomes of 
people with and without a particular disease, looking for single -base differences (known as single 
nucl eotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) that might signal the presence of a gene or some other functional 
sequence implicated in the disease.  GWAS are based on the  Haplotype Map  (HapMap) of the human 
genome, produced via an NIH -led international research team earli er in the decade that identified more 
than 3 million relatively common SNPs in human genomes that serve as markers for larger 
neighborhoods of DNA sequences.64 GWAS scans point to regions of the genome that are worthy of 
closer study in seeking the genetic cause of a disease.  Over 1,600  of such studies have been conducted 
since the technique was first developed in 2005, flagging genetic areas that may be linked with at least 
80 different diseases and disorders including heart disease, diabetes, obesity, inflammatory bowel 
diseases, and many types of cancer.65 
Information emerging from NIDCR investments in GWAS of dental caries complements other clinical 
research on caries risk factors, allowing genetic factors to be considered, along with behavioral, 
environmental, and microbial determinants of caries development, when treatment decisions are made.  
Molecular -based oral health care will transform the most fundamental principle of the dental profession 
—restoration of form and function —as dentists will u se the precision of individual genetic and 
physiological information as their operational guide.  In addition, a recent GWAS of cleft lip and/or cleft 
palate ,66 the fourth most common birth defect, is providing insight into genetic variants and their 
interpl ay with non -genetic factors, which may lead to improved prevention and treatment strategies.  
NIDCR is also supporting efforts to identify the genetic component of areas critical to diverse patient 
groups, such as Sjögren’s Syndrome and periodontal disease.  NIDCR investments are catalyzing 
tremendous progress in understanding the role of genetic variation in a wide range of conditions such as 
craniosynostosis (premature closing of joints between bones in the skull) using more targeted 
genotyping, DNA sequenc ing, gene expression studies in tissues, and animal models of human

 54 conditions.  These investments are laying the groundwork for translation of compelling clinical leads into 
improved, individually tailored care.  
While the genetic causes of most diseases an d disorders are not fully understood, NIH researchers have 
identified individual genes or regions of DNA associated with numerous  diseases and disorders , such as  
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; cancers of the skin, lung, brain, pancreas, breast, prosta te, and 
testicle, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia; diabetes; periodontitis in African Americans; asthma; high 
blood pressure; heart arrhythmias; inflammatory bowel  disease s; kidney disease;  Alzheimer’s disease; 
and obesity, among many others.  
NIH complete d full sequencing and analysis of multiple vertebrate and invertebrate animal genomes 
over the past four years.  These include the platypus, domestic cattle, the wasp, other insects, and a 
large number of disease -causing organisms —such as the malaria -causin g parasite  Plasmodium vivax,  the 
common intestinal parasite  Giardia lamblia , the Lyme disease -causing tick  Ixodes scapularis , and two 
species of the parasitic flatworms that cause schistosomiasis.  Also sequenced were thousands of 
separate strains of the constantly changing human influenza viruses.  NIAID now has sequenced the 
genomes of thousands of infectious microorganisms, including 10,000 influenza viruses.  
NIH-funded analysis of genomic data from 121 African populations, 4 African American populations , and 
60 non -African populations revealed that all African populations descended from 14 ancestral groups.  
Most African Americans trace the majority of their ancestry to West Africa, a finding that will improve 
scientists’ ability to identify genetic risk factors in African and African American populations.  
Epigenetics   
While the genetic composition of an organism undoubtedly is an important determinant of health and 
disease, additional mechanisms are involved in interpreting the genome and guiding molecul ar, cellular, 
and developmental processes.  In the emerging field of epigenetics, scientists are uncovering a complex 
code of chemical markers that influence whether genes are active or silent, independent of DNA 
sequence.  While epigenetics refers to the st udy of a single gene or sets of genes, epigenomics refers to 
more global analyses of epigenetic changes across the entire genome.  Epigenetic processes control 
normal growth and development and is disrupted in diseases such as cancer.  Diet and exposure to 
environmental chemicals throughout all stages of human development, among other factors, can cause 
epigenetic changes that may turn certain genes on or off . Research in animal models has revealed that 
particular parenting behaviors trigger epigenetic change s and alterations in physiological and behavioral 
function of offspring.  Changes in genes that would normally protect against a disease could  make people 
more susceptible to developing that disease later in life.  Researchers also believe some epigenetic 
changes can be passed on from generation to generation.  NIH-funded scientists have demonstrated that 
epigenetic changes are associated with the development and growth of many types of tumors.  
The NIH Common Fund  Epigenomics Program aims to stimulate researc h to understand the role of 
epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the origins of health and susceptibility to disease.  It is 
anticipated that this program will transform biomedical research by developing comprehensive 
reference epigenome maps, identi fying novel epigenetic marks, and developing new technologies for 
 55 comprehensive epigenomic analyses.  In addition, new lines of research are aimed at understanding how 
environmental exposures may work through epigenetic mechanisms to affect susceptibility a nd 
development of disease. Ongoing epigenomic projects include studies on cognitive decline, 
atherosclerosis, and effects of b isphenol A exposure.67 
The Microbiome  
The body of a healthy human adult is home to an enormous bacterial ecosystem, with bacterial cells 
outnumbering human cells by a factor of 10 to 1.  Despite misconceptions that often associate all 
bacteria with disease, most of the natural bacterial flora is composed of commensal —or beneficial —
specie s that actually perform  necessary cellular functions (such as the digestion of certain nutrients in 
the intestines).  Through the NIH Common Fund , the Human Microbiome Project aims to discover the 
composition of microbial communities that exist in different  parts of the human body and understand 
how these communities are associated with human health and disease.  For example, microbial 
communities may contribute to such diseases and conditions as obesity, diabetes, cancer, and 
autoimmune diseases. Sequencing technology has, as with human genomics, speeded the study of the 
microbiome considerably. NHGRI and other NIH ICs are using sequencing technology, among other 
methods, to study bacterial species in and on the human body.  However, other high throughput 
technologies offer the potential to enrich our understanding of the contribution of the microbiome. The 
Common Fund is supporting studies to explore the utility of these approaches.  
Dovetailing with this effort, NIDCR -supported researchers and others recently  identified the more than 
600 distinct microbial species that are residents of the human mouth.  NIDCR -supported researchers 
have gathered this information in the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD ), the first example of a 
curated human body site -specific  microbiome resource which is freely available to the public.  Advances 
in studying oral microbial communities have the potential for rapid impact on research for new, more 
personally targeted, clinical treatment.  For example, researchers have identified a microbe called 
Scardovia wiggsiae  that appears to be linked with severe forms of early childhood caries.   
Translating the Genetic Code: Transcriptomics, Proteomics, and Metabolomics  
Beyond understanding genes and their regulation, NIH also supports system -wide studies to understand 
which  genes are actually turned on and off and when (transcriptomics).  Since genes code for the 
proteins that carry out almost all cellular functions, unde rstanding which genes are active and, by 
extension, the catalog of proteins carrying out cellular functions (proteomics) in a given cell type under 
particular sets of conditions provides a picture of the molecular players involved in health  and disease.  
In the growing field of metabolomics, researchers are using high -throughput methodologies to 
characterize the types and amounts of metabolic compounds present in our cells and to map the 
metabolic pathways and networks through which they are generated and re gulated.  By studying the 
network of chemical pathways and their chemical products, such  studies have the capability of defining 
normal homeostatic and disease mechanisms.  Having identified pathways and compounds associated

 56 with disease progression, researc hers can then use hypothesis -driven basic research experiments to 
further understand how particular proteins and molecules function in the pathways.  
Structural Biology of Proteins  
In addition to understanding the collective composition of proteins in a c ell, researchers also aim to 
characterize their three -dimensional structures.  The Structural Biology Roadmap is a strategic effort to 
create a "picture" gallery of the molecular shapes of proteins in the body.  Of particular interest, NIH is 
focusing effort s on determining structures of the proteins that reside in the membrane barrier that 
separates the inside of the cell from the outside.  These membrane proteins account for about 30 
percent of the proteins in the cell and are major targets for developing th erapeutic drugs to treat 
particular disease s by blocking, inhibiting, or activating specific molecule s.  
Glycomics  
NIH is also mapping out additional molecular compounds associated with cellular function.  In one field, 
NIH is seeking to understand the role  of glycans —complex chains of sugar molecules —in various cellular 
functions.  Glycans often are found attached to the surface of cells and to proteins found on the cell 
surface, and they serve important roles in inflammation, arteriosclerosis, immune defect s, neural 
development, and cancer metastasis.  To advance the field of "glycomics," NIH supports programs that 
develop technologies for the analysis of glycans in complex biological systems and has established the 
Consortium for Functional Glycomics, which provides access to a technological infrastructure for 
glycobiology in support of basic research.  Recent findings indicate that basic research on glycosylation 
may lead to the development of broad spectrum antivirals.  
Systems Biology  
With the increasing ap plication of " -omics" and high -throughput technologies, scientists are generating 
massive amounts of data on the genetic and molecular basis of biological processes and responses.  In an 
effort to put all of this information together across multiple scales,  NIH researchers are pioneering the 
emerging field of systems biology.  Systems biology draws on the expertise of biology, mathematics, 
engineering, and the physical sciences to integrate experimental data with computational approaches 
that generate models to describe complex biological systems.  In addition to describing the interactions 
among genes, proteins, and metabolites, the models are intended to be predictive of physiological 
behavior in response to natural and artificial perturbations.  By monitoring  the effects of a perturbation 
in "virtual" experiments, scientists can generate hypotheses that are tested  in cellular systems or model 
organisms to gain a better understanding of the molecular contributions to normal health and disease.  
To support initia tives in this area, NIH has established National Centers for Systems Biology.  At 10 
interdisciplinary centers, NIH -funded scientists are using computational modeling and analysis to study 
the complex dynamics of molecular signaling and regulatory networks involved in cell proliferation, 
differentiation, and death; developmental pattern formation in organisms; genome organization and 
evolution; and drug effects on cells, organs, and tissues.  The Program in Systems Immunology and 
Infectious Disease Modeling, a component of NIH’s intramural research program, seeks to apply a 
 57 systems biology approach to characterize a complex biological system : the human immune system.  In 
this effort, researchers are seeking to develop models that enhance our understanding of th e molecular 
basis for an immune response to infection or vaccination.  The NIH Integrative Cancer Biology Program 
(ICBP) is providing new insights into the development and progression of cancer as a complex biological 
system.  Researchers at ICBP Centers are  generating and validating computational models that describe 
and simulate the complex process of cancer, which should ultimately lead to better cancer prevention, 
diagnostics, and therapeutics.  
Environmental Factors that Impinge on Human Health and Diseas e 
Cells not only  respond to changes in their  microscopic environment  but also sens e and respond to 
environmental factors present in our macroscopic human world.  As part of its effort to reduce the 
burden of human illness and disability, NIH supports basic research to understand how environmental 
factors are detected by our bodies and how, at all levels —molecular , epigenetic,  cellular , organ, and 
behavioral systems —they influence the development and progression of human diseases.  At the NIEHS, 
the IC devoted specifically to these goals, research programs are elucidating the effects of exposure to a 
range of toxic air pollutants in utero  and resulting impaired development in fetuses and offspring, as 
well as increased potential for development of a range of chronic diseases later in life. Other programs 
are looking at the impacts of climate change on increased vulnerability of certain pop ulations to a wide 
range of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, asthma, cancer, and mental disorders, as well as 
effects of exposure to a broad range of environmental chemicals including pesticides and endocrine 
disruptors. NIH also has established re search programs to investigate the relationship between exposure 
to heavy metals, such as mercury, in the environment and the progression and development of 
autoimmune disorders; understanding, at the molecular level, how these agents impart immune system 
dysfunction could offer potential therapeutic targets for treating these disorders.  
Basic Behavioral and Social Science Research  
It has been estimated that human behavior accounts for almost 40 percent of the risk associated with 
preventable premature deat hs in the U.S.68 Health -injuring behaviors such as smoking, drinking, and 
drug abuse, as well as inactivity and poor diet are known to contribute to many common diseases and 
adverse health conditions.  Unfortunately, there are few tried and true approaches t o motivate people to 
adopt and maintain healthy behaviors over time.  
Recognizing the importance of behavioral and social factors in health and disease, NIH supports a broad 
portfolio of research in the basic behavioral and social sciences.  Research in the se areas provides 
fundamental knowledge and informs approaches that are essential for understanding individual and 
collective systems of behavior and psychosocial functioning; for predicting, preventing, and controlling 
illness; for developing more persona lized (tailored) interventions; for enhancing adherence to treatment 
and minimizing the collateral impact of disease; and for promoting optimal health and well -being across 
the lifespan and over generations.

 58 Basic behavioral and social sciences research s upported by NIH is composed  of research on behavioral 
and social processes, biopsychosocial research, and research on methodology and measurement.  Within 
the first category is research on behavior change, including the study of factors (e.g., cognitive, so cial, 
economic, environmental, and developmental) that shape health decision -making and the conditions 
under which knowledge leads to action vs. inaction.  Basic behavioral economic and decision research 
approaches —such as "choice architecture" that describ es the way in which decisions are influenced by 
how the choices are presented, as well as the use of financial incentives to promote behavior change —
are yielding findings that may be translated into effective interventions to change behavior and improve 
health.  Basic research on social networks is improving our understanding of how smoking and obesity 
spread through socially connected individuals and provides insight into how networks might be used as 
vehicles to spread healthy behaviors.  
In 2010, the NIH Common Fund launched the Science of Behavior Change program to improve our 
understanding of human behavior change across a broad range of health -related behaviors. The 
program now supports research that integrates basic and translational science and cuts a cross 
disciplines of cognitive and affective neuroscience, neuroeconomics, behavioral genetics, and behavioral 
economics. The program aims to establish the groundwork for a unified science of behavior change that 
capitalizes on both the emerging basic scie nce and the progress already made in the design of 
behavioral interventions in specific disease areas.  
Also launched in FY 2010, the NIH Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) is 
a trans -NIH initiative supported and managed by 24  ICs and four program coordination Offices within 
the OD. Its mission is to pursue opportunities for  strengthening basic behavioral and social science 
research at the NIH while innovating beyond existing investments. In FY 2010, OppNet funded short -
term, m entored career development awards in the basic behavioral and social sciences for mid -career 
and senior investigators, and competitive revisions in basic behavioral and social sciences research, 
HIV/AIDS -related research and Small Business Innovation Resea rch and Small Business Transfer 
Technology Research Grants. In FY 2011 OppNet funded new awards to support basic research on the 
following topics: self -regulation; the effects of the social environment on health; sleep and the social 
environment; psychosoc ial stress; and basic mechanisms influencing behavioral maintenance. In 
addition, the initiative supported short - term, interdisciplinary research education programs for new 
investigators, scientific meetings to foster the development of interdisciplinary research teams, 
additional competitive revisions, and short term, mentored career development awards. By fostering 
basic research on behavioral and social processes, OppNet supports the NIH mission to seek 
fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavio r of living systems and the application  of that 
knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.69 
Biopsychosocial research looks at the interaction between biological, psychological, and social processes 
and includes research on gene -environment interactions and other biobehavioral processes.  The 
Exposure Biology Program, of the NIH Genes, Environment and Health Initiative , supports the 
development of tools to measure dietary intake, physical activity, psychosoci al stress, and addictive 
                                                 
69 Additional information about OppNet can be found at http://oppnet.nih.gov/index .  
 59 substances —aspects of the behavioral and social environment —in addition to tools to measure 
environmental pollutants, for future use in studies of gene -environment interactions.  Biopsychosocial 
research in humans and rodent models is elucidating how psychosocial stressors influence biological 
pathways involved in the growth and spread of cancer.  Knowledge gained from biopsychosocial research 
will inform interventions to prevent, manage, and treat a variety of diseases and disorders.  
Methodological development in the behavioral and social sciences includes a new emphasis on systems -
science approaches.  Much like the systems approaches to biology described above, systems science 
examines the multilevel, complex interrelationships among the many determinants of health —
biological, behavioral, and social —to provide a way to address complex problems within the framework 
of the "big picture."  Systems science involves developing computational models to examine the dynamic 
interrelationships of  variables at multiple levels of analysis (e.g., from cells to society) simultaneously 
(often through causal feedback processes), while also studying impact on the behavior of the system as 
a whole over time.  For instance, systems -science methodologies are  beginning to be employed for 
planning and preparing against acute threats to public health such as global spread of a pandemic 
influenza.  The Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) is a collaboration of seven multi -
institutional research and inf ormatics groups focused on developing computational models of the 
interactions between infectious agents and their hosts, disease spread, prediction systems, and 
response strategies.  The models will be useful to policymakers, public health workers, and oth er 
researchers who want to better understand and respond to emerging infectious diseases.  Chronic 
diseases and risk factors for which systems science approaches would enhance our understanding and 
decision -making capacity include heart disease, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, eating behavior, 
physical activity, smoking, and drug and alcohol use.  
Research Resources, Infrastructure, and Technology Development  
In building the foundation for its broad portfolio of basic research programs, NIH also make s significant 
investments in the development of research resources, infrastructure, and state -of-the-art technologies 
that facilitate the next discoveries in biomedical and behavioral research.  In line with its interest to 
ensure that research resources de veloped with NIH funding are made readily available to the research 
community for further study , NIH supports multiple repositories for the collection and dissemination of 
animal models, cell lines, and other vital biomedical research reagents.  Repositorie s are updated 
continuously as resources become available and include the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers, 
which stores, maintains, and distributes selected lines of genetically engineered mice; the National Stem 
Cell Bank, which makes human embryoni c stem cell lines readily available; and the Beta Cell Biology 
Consortium, which generates animal models and antibodies that are available to the scientific 
community for research on type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  eyeGENE®, a nationwide partnership of 250 
Registered Clinical Organizations , has created  a national , open -access DNA repository of genetic samples 
from highly characterized individuals and families . Serving both research and clinical needs, the Network 
has broaden ed accessibility of diagnostic geneti c testing through a central and secure process , testing  70 
genes in over 30 inherited eye diseases from  3,500 patient samples  since its establishment in 2006.  
 60 In addition to animal models and research reagents, NIH also supports the distribution of massive  
amounts of genome sequence, transcriptional profiling, and cellular structure function data for use and 
analysis by the research community at large.  NIH continues to serve as a leading global resource for 
building, curating, and providing sophisticated ac cess to molecular biology and genomic information.  In 
addition to databases, NIH also provides resources for retrieving, visualizing, and analyzing molecular 
biology and genome sequence data online.  
  
 61 Preclinical Translational Research   
Translating basic  discoveries from the laboratory into new or more effective diagnostics and 
therapeutics is essential for tackling unmet biomedical needs and improving human health.  However, 
the translational process can be complex, costly, and risk -laden,  as evidenced by the less -than -one-
percent of compounds initially tested  that actually mak e it into the patient’s medicine cabinet.  The 
development of medical devices , imaging techniques , and behavioral interventions  follow a similar path 
of progression . It can take more than a decade before a basic scientific finding is able to advance 
through preclinical and clinical studies to result in a new treatment, medical device, or prevention 
method.  And many promising leads from basic research fail to become a prove n strategy to address 
health, often failing in the preclinical stage.  
However, today a dvances in biomedical research and technologies have created unprecedented 
opportunities to transform the translational development pipeline , especially in the preclinica l stage . 
Recent discoveries in basic science have uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying hundreds of 
diseases, resulting in many more potential strategies for intervening against disease progression.  
Furthermore, high -throughput technologies are more readily available to academic investigators and 
allow all those in biomedical research to pursue these strategies at what would have been an 
unimaginable pace just a few years ago.  For example, this technology can be used to identify new 
therapeutic c andidates  at a dizzying speed. Finally, p artnership efforts are significantly changing the 
research landscape, in part by spearheading the implementation of scientific projects that no one party 
would be able to perform independently.  
NIH is uniquely poise d to capitalize on these developments. Numerous  NIH programs and resources  are 
dedicated to supporting  research that moves basic research through to preclinical testing and beyond.  
NIH also has a unique capability to foster critical multidisciplinary colla borations, whose synergistic 
efforts can lead to new technologies and devices for diagnosing, preventing , and curing diseases and for 
bringing new discoveries into common medical practice.   
NIH supports the development of consortia, cooperative study group s, and networks that enable a 
single institution or researcher to combine knowledge and resources with others.   
The federal government plays a critical role in focusing on gaps in translational research that would 
otherwise remain unaddressed by other enti ties (e.g., pharmaceutical companies, nonprofit 
organizations).  Specifically, NIH supports translational studies unlikely to garner substantial investment 
by other sources because of insufficient financial incentives —for example, studies that address rare 
diseases, entail perceived  high risk, or involve  lifestyle alterations or behavioral changes. In its unique 
position, NIH can bring together resources that offer unprecedented opportunities. For example, NIH’s 
ability to create consortia is particularly us eful for studying rare diseases, as they make it possible to 
recruit sufficient numbers of participants to provide the necessary sample for preclinical and clinical 
study.  
 
 62 The Discovery of Biomarkers  
Each NIH IC  supports a robust portfolio of translational research which exploits basic science discoveries 
for the creation of new ways to intervene against specific disease processes.  One important way that 
basic science may be used to better clinical treatment is through the identification, development and 
validation of biomarkers.  Biomarkers are physical, functional, or biochemical indicators of physiologic or 
disease processes  and play important roles in the diagnosis of disease, the identification of patient 
populations that could benefit from particular therapies, and the monitoring of treatment effectiveness.  
 The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an example of an innovative public -private 
partnership to develop uniform standards for acquir ing longitudinal, multisite biomarker data, including 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), cerebrospinal fluid, and blood 
data to characterize the progression from normal cognition  to Alzheimer’s disease  with greater 
sensit ivity.  In 2010, ADNI entered its second major five -year phase ( ADNI 2) focusing on participants 
who exhibit the very beginning stages of memory loss . One important aspect of the study is the data will 
be posted to a publicly accessible database and available to qualified researchers worldwide.  This 
initiative will speed the pace of discovery by providing a centralized resource allowing investigators t o 
access, study, and share their own high -quality data relevant to AD.  
Genomics  Translational Research   
The rapid pace of genomics research has led to a multitude of efforts to apply this understanding to the 
development of better ways of preventing, detec ting and treating any number of diseases and 
conditions.   
By developing a a deeper understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms that cause cancer , 
NCI is finding new ways of identifying those at risk for certain cancers and for determining more pr ecise 
strategies to treat those with cancer.  Within its Center for Cancer Genomics , the Cancer Genome Atlas is 
a multi -institutional, collaborative study conducted jointly with NHGRI  that seeks to identify the changes 
in each cancer’s genome that results in specific subtypes of that cancer.  This knowledge will ultimately 
lay the foundation for improving cancer prevention, early detection and treatment . It has recently 
cataloged the ge netic alterations in two important cancers for which early diagnostic methods, broadly 
applicable prevention strategies, and effective therapies are not yet availabl e: the uniformly lethal brain 
cancer glioblastoma multiforme and serous ovarian carcinoma.  
NHLBI has funded several genome consortia with strong translational components.  Research focuses 
include the identification of genetic variants that may explain why some people with asthma do not 
benefit from inhaled corticosteroids , gene and chromosomal v ariations that affect pulmonary fibrosis 
risk and cystic fibrosis severity , improving outcome prediction for myelod ysplastic syndromes , 
identification of genetic factors that influence blood pressure , and development of a blood test to 
predict the future d evelopment of diabetes.  
Scientists are discovering more and more specific genetic variations that may influence an individual’s  
response to medications. By identifying these variations, health care providers will move beyond the 
 63 current one -size-fits all approach to treatment towards prescribing drugs and dosages that are tailored 
to the  individual’s genetic make -up. A collaborative effort across several NIH ICs, the Pharmacogenetics 
Research Network (PGRN) is helping meet the urgent need  for experts in pharmacogenomics and 
personalized medicine  by creating a nationwide network of researchers and numerous resources to 
facilitate their work.  The Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB), a 
component of PGRN, sponsors data -sharing within  and beyond the consortia.  Recently, PharmGKB 
collaborated with several genomics groups at Stanford University to develop an integrative personal 
omics profile  (iPOP) that combines genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and autoantibody 
data from  a single individual over a 14 -month period , providing a rich data resource for numerous 
studies.  
NHGRI is conducting  a large pilot project to test ways in which high -throughput genome sequencing 
might be used in a clinical setting for diagnosing and treating patients.  Using the NIH Clinical Center, the 
trial, dubbed " ClinSeq " (Clinical Sequencing ), has enroll ed 900 patients  to date  with a spectrum of 
coronary artery calcification, from normal to diseased, and will sequence 200 –400 areas of their DNA 
that contain genes suspected of involvement in heart disease.  Patients will have the option of learning 
the outcome of their tests, and those who carry a variant of a gene that has been linked to disease will 
be counseled and followed, possibly for years.  The study is designed both as a pilot project to explore 
ways o f using genome sequencing in patient treatment and as an effort to develop new data about 
particular genes’ involvement in heart disease.  The project may expand in its later stages to cover other 
diseases.  
In a program known as the  Multiplex Initiative, in dividuals ages 25 –40 are offered free testing for 15 
genes associated with higher risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood 
pressure, osteoporosis, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and malignant melanoma.70 Those who are 
offered the testing use an interactive, Internet -based program designed by NHGRI  researchers that 
helps participants ask questions about the genetic testing, get information, and decide whether to 
receive the testing.  Meanwhile, Multiplex Ini tiative researchers monitor the participants’ decision 
process every step of the way.  Those who decide to submit blood samples for the tests will be followed 
for some time  in order  to see whether they change their behavior ( e.g., by adopting a healthier li festyle 
or diet) in response to their test results.71 Researchers involved with this study have found that 
individuals who discuss their genetic information with their doctors may be among the most motivated 
to take steps toward more healthy choices.  
Behavi oral and Social Sciences Translational Research  
Multiple efforts across NIH seek to translate basic behavioral and social sciences research into clinical 
interventions. For example, NIA supports the Edward R. Roybal Centers for Translation Research in the 
Behavioral and Social Sciences in Aging.  As the baby boomer generation continues to celebrate 
milestone birthdays, improving the health of older Americans is more im portant than ever. The goal of 
                                                 
70 For more information, see http://www.multiplex.nih.gov/ .

http://genome.gov/pvf.cfm?pageID=25521955 .  
 64 the centers is to improve the health, quality of life, and p roductivity of middle -aged and older people.  
The centers work to facilitate translation of basic behavioral and social science to practical outcomes by 
developing new technologies and by stimulating new use -inspired research (that is, research focused on 
meeting a societal need, usually for a device to improve quality of life for certain populations).  Roybal 
investigators have made several key discoveries. For example, researchers have developed tools and 
technologies for identifying older adults at risk fo r automobile crash involvement, and are working with 
industry partners to develop and disseminate products based on these tools. Additionally, researchers 
have developed a "living laboratory" model methodology for in -home assessment of activity to facilita te 
early detection of changes in health or memory. Several centers will focus on the social network 
underpinnings of selected health problems affecting older people, such as obesity and cancer, develop 
new interventions to improve health outcomes and financial well -being while reducing costs, and foster 
translation of approaches from behavioral economics to the improvement of health care delivery for 
older adults.72 
Clinical and Translational Science Awards  
The Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA ) program supports collaborative teams of 
investigators  representing diverse specialties  to tackle complex health and research challenges and 
accelerate translation of discoveries into treatments for patients.  The consortium of 60 medical research 
institutions across the nation enables innovative research teams to speed discovery and advance science 
aimed at improving our nation's health.  The program encourages CTSA -initiated changes in research 
infrastructure , includ ing coordinated programs to train a nd educate early -stage clinical and translational 
scientists, and development of bioinformatics programs to manage medical record data and transform 
institutional research activities and resources into searchable databases.  The teams are making progress 
across a broad range of diseases and conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, neurological disorders , and 
heart disease.  CTSA resources to foster translational research include i2iConnect,  a database of industry 
contacts looking for new ideas and products that researchers and other innovators can search quickly by 
specialty and disease area to find potential industry partners interested in their work; CTSA -IP, an online 
intellectual property  search engine that aggregates and promotes technologies from CTSA institutions 
and NIH to enhance research activity and encourage private partnerships; and the  CTSA Pharmaceutical 
Assets Portal , which enables scientists to learn more about compounds evalu ated for specific diseases 
that might be used to treat other conditions.  
Examples of CTSA -enabled Translational Research Advances  
Researchers at the Scripps Translational Science Institute and the University of California, San Diego, 
Clinical and Translati onal Research Institute invented a new technique to investigate and help identify 
risk for coronary artery disease (CAD).  They discovered variations in the DNA in one area of the genome 
that changed the way a gene in a totally different area functioned, thus increasing CAD risk.  This 
discovery opens the door to new interventions that could one day predict heart attacks before they 
happen  and may lead to insights into other conditions linked to poorly understood genetic risk factors.

 65 Pilot research by a te am at The Ohio State University Center for Clinical and Translational Science 
indicates that oxygen therapy can protect rodent brain cells during stroke, when a blood clot blocks the 
flow of oxygen -rich blood to the brain.  In the study, the team found that  oxygen therapy could reduce 
brain damage when given during a stroke but was less effective after surgeons removed the blockage, 
pointing to the need to begin the therapy soon after stroke onset  to achieve the best results.73 These 
findings easily could lea d to a new therapy , because providing oxygen to stroke patients would be 
simple and fast.

 66 Clinical Research   
NIH places a high priority on clinical research as it is the primary source of insights about new means for 
reducing the burden of illness and improving public health . Clinical research is patient -oriented research 
that is conducted with human subjects (i.e., research  that involve s direct interaction between 
investigators and human subjects or the use of material of human origin, such as tissues,  specimens, and 
data that retain information that would allow the investigator to readily ascertain the identity of the 
subject).  Clinical research includes clinical trials, behavioral and observational studies including long -
term natural history studies, and outcomes research.   
 At the overarching level of the NIH Office of the Director, the Office of Science Policy w orks on an array 
of issues and activities designed to harmonize regulatory aspects governing the conduct of clinical 
research to en hance the consistency of the rules and to ensure utmost consideration for the safety, 
rights, and welfare of subjects  while minimizing unnecessary burdens on investigators. For example, NIH 
has partner ed with several federal  agencies to ensure that a stand ard reporting format  called the  Basal 
Adverse Event Report  (BAER)  is available for investigators to report adverse events associated with their 
clinical research.  The BAER is designed to simplify and streamline the submission of safety reports to 
multiple agencies.  
Clinical trials are a crucial subset of clinical research.  They are the best method of determining whether 
interventions are safe and effective in people and assessing side effects or other complications.  They are 
designed to answer specific res earch questions about biomedical or behavioral intervention s. NIH 
supports many types of clinical trials.  Treatment trials might test experimental drugs or devices, new 
combinations of drugs,  or innovative approaches to surgery or radiation therapy.  Preven tion trials look 
for better ways either to prevent a disease or to keep it from returning , and they may employ research 
approaches assessing medicines, vaccines, and lifestyle changes, among other things.  Screening and 
diagnostic trials are conducted to fi nd better ways to detect or diagnose diseases or conditions, and 
quality -of-life trials (or supportive care trials) explore ways to improve people’s comfort and ability to 
continue the activities of daily life , even as they deal with chronic illnesses or a pproach the end of life.   
The translation and transfer of research knowledge and clinical trial findings into hospitals, doctors’ 
office s, and community sett ings is essential if patients are to reap the benefits of clinical research . NIH 
nurtures strategie s that bring basic research discoveries and clinical research into practice . NIH also 
developed an important educational site called NIH Clinical Research Trials and You  to help people learn 
more about clinical trials, why they matter, and how to participate  (see Information at the Service of 
Health on page 7 6).  
The federal government plays a critical role by supporting important areas of clinical research that are 
unlikely or rarely addressed by other  sector s (e.g., pharmaceutical companies, nonp rofit organizations).  
Specifically, NIH supports clinical and translational studies unlikely to garner substantial investment from  
other sources because of insufficient financial incentives . Examples include  studies that address rare 
diseases, are consider ed high risk, and/ or are based on lifestyle alterations or behavioral changes rather 
 67 than drugs or devices.  NIH’s ICs oversee a broad portfolio of clinical research that encompasses 
intramural and extramural programs.   
Clinical Resources and Programs  
As described in the previous section, the CTSA program supports a national consortium of medical 
research institutions that are transforming the way biomedical research is conducted.  Its goals are to 
accelerate the translation of laboratory discoveries into t reatments for patients, to engage communities 
in clinical research efforts, and to train a new generation of clinical and translational researchers.  
Launched in 2006 by NIH, the CTSA program has enabled innovative research teams to speed discovery 
and adva nce science aimed at improving our nation’s health.  The CTSA program encourages 
collaborative teams of investigators to tackle complex health and research challenges and then find 
ways to turn discoveries into practical solutions for patients.  These teams are already making progress 
across a broad range of diseases and conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, neurological disorders, and 
heart disease.  They also work with industry, manufacturers, patient groups, and nonprofit organizations 
to ensure that potent ially life -saving new drugs and devices reach the public faster.  
CTSAs provide a foundation for clinical and translational research by providing specialized infrastructure 
support to NIH -funded scientists, engaging community partners to connect scientists  with those who 
both are underrepresented and could benefit from research, and helping to train the next generation of 
clinical and translational scientists.  In addition, they provide tools and resources such as ResearchMatch, 
a secure electronic volunteer  recruitment registry to provide individuals nationwide with opportunities 
to be considered for participation in research studies and clinical trials.74  
Examples of CTSA -enabled Clinical Research Advances  
Stanford University’s Biodesign program trains inte rdisciplinary groups of graduate students in 
medicine, engineering , and business in the skill of medical “inventorship” and provides small proof -of-
concept grants for projects with high potential to improve patients’ lives.  Several new devices the 
students  have created through this program, partially supported by the Stanford Center for Clinical and 
Translational Education and Research, are now being brought to market.  These include a ventilator 
prototype designed for use during natural disasters , and the f irst inexpensive, natural -motion prosthetic 
knee for leg amputees in resource -poor countries.  
With funding through the Translational Tool Pilot Program and Clinical Research Scholars Program at the 
University of Pittsburgh Clinical and Translational Scienc e Institute, investigators have developed a 
device to translate brain commands into actions for assisted devices, potentially improving quality of life 
for patients disabled by spinal cord injury, stroke , or neurodegenerative disease.  The device recently 
received FDA and institutional review board  (IRB)  approval to study brain control in individuals with 
paralysis.  The ultimate aim is to close the gap for paralyzed patients between what they wish they could 
do and what they can do.

 68 A powerful research colla boration with the Scripps Translational Science Institute, the West Wireless 
Health Institute, wireless device manufacturers , and the CTSA consortium is enabling researchers to 
conduct large -scale studies to discover how wireless devices, many the size of a small adhesive bandage, 
can be used to improve patient health and reduce health care costs.  
NIH Clinical Center  
The majority of NIH clinical research takes place at teaching hospitals around the country and overseas.  
Approximately 1,500 studies, however,  take place at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland at 
any given time.  The NIH Clinical Center opened its doors in 1953, but the scope of NIH research 
expanded significantly with the opening of the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center  in 2005 . The 
Clinical Center is now one of the largest federal buildings in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  
The NIH Clinical Center is the nation’s largest hospital devoted entirely to clinical research.  Each year, 
the Clinical Center serves more than 10,000 new patients and 6,000 inpatients and supports over 95,000 
outpatient visits.  In addition to the approximately 1,200 credentialed physicians, dentists, and post -
doctoral  researchers, it houses over 600 nurses and 450 other allied health professional s including 
pharmacists, dieticians, medical and imaging technologists, therapists, and medical records and supply 
staff.  Since the hospital opened, it has hosted more than 400,000 clinical research participants.  Because 
the Clinical Center is  a research f acility, only patients with the precise kind s or stage s of illness under 
investigation are admitted for treatment.  There are no labor and delivery services and no other services 
common to community hospitals.  All patients must be referred by their physicia ns. 
The Clinical Center, along with its active partners and research participants, contributed to milestone 
achievements such as the development of chemotherapy for cancer; the first use of an immunotoxin to 
treat a malignancy (hairy cell leukemia); identi fication of the genes that cause kidney cancer, leading to 
the development of six new, targeted treatments for advanced kidney cancer; demonstration that 
lithium helps depression; the first gene therapy; the first treatment of AIDS (with AZT); and the 
deve lopment of tests to detect AIDS/HIV and hepatitis viruses in blood, which led to a safer blood 
supply.  
Along with NHGRI and ORDR, the Clinical Center hosts the Undiagnosed Diseases Program  (UDP), 
through which individuals with longstanding medical conditio ns that elude diagnosis by physicians 
elsewhere can come for consultation.  This trans -NIH program has two main goals , which are to provide 
answers to patients with mysterious conditions that have long eluded diagnosis and to advance medical 
knowledge about  rare and common diseases.  
Over 326 cases have been  accepted into the program.  After its first two years of work, the UDP is citing 
successes in patients whose cases have stumped specialists at leading medical institutions around the 
country.75 Furthermore , the UDP announced the program’s first discovery of a new disease, called ACDC, 
or arterial calcification due to deficiency of the protein CD73, in the New England Journal of Medicine . 
CD73 produces a small molecule, adenosine, that protects arteries from calcifying.  A report on  an

 69 additional new disorder is pending publication.  Such discoveries could have implications for people with 
more common diseases and disorders.  
In recognition of some of its achievements, the Clinical Center received the 2011 Lasker Public Service 
Award for creating a research hospital where doctors develop innovative therapies and explore new 
ways to diagnose, treat, and prevent a wide variety of diseases.  
Institute and Center Clinical Research Activities  
Nearly all of the NIH ICs support  a combination of resources, programs, and initiatives targeted toward 
strengthening clinical research, through either the enhancement of existing capacities or the 
engineering of new ones.  Clinical testing of novel therapies for disorders is critically important to the 
development of new treatments for patients and is necessary for advancing new research discoveries 
into clinical practice.  However, clinical trials require a significant amount of administrative, financial , and 
scientific resources, particularly during the start -up period when the infrastructure must be established 
and protocols approved.  NINDS is expediting this process through the Network for Excellence in 
Neuroscience Clinical Trials ( NeuroNEXT ), a new neurolo gy clinical trials network that will offer shared 
infrastructure and expertise across neurology diseases.  These centralized resources will include support 
for patient recruitment into trials, protocol -development assistance, and a central IRB, which are 
expected to expedite trial start -up time.  The network will reduce delays in building infrastructure for 
each new trial, improve the speed of enrollment of trial participants, and enable better choices of 
therapies for Phase III trials.  
NIH and NCI are working to develop policies to improve the complications that may arise from multiple 
institutional reviews of a single clinical protocol for multisite trial s where reviews can be a barrier to the 
efficient and timely initiation of trials.  For instance, NC I developed a central IRB initiative to improve 
access to NCI -sponsored Cooperative Group clinical trials by enabling local IRBs to approve clinical trials 
rapidly through the use of a facilitated review process , enhance the protection of study participant s by 
providing consistent expert IRB review at the national level , and  reduce the administrative burdens 
associated with IRB submission on local IRB staff and investigators.  Moreover, the NIH Clinical Research 
Policy Analysis and Coordination program is a focal point for streamlining and optimizing policies and 
requirements concerning the conduct and oversight of clinical research.  
NHLBI launched a major clinical trial to test a gene -based method of prescribing warfarin, a blood 
thinner that is widely used to prevent life -threatening blood clots.  About 2 million Americans start 
taking warfarin each year, but the drug’s effect can vary significantly  from one patient to another . 
Regular blood tests are needed to both establish an initial dose level and maintain the proper level as 
time goes on —for months and often for years.  In early 2009, an international research consortium 
combined patien ts’ genetic and clinical data to produce a computer algorithm  for initial dosing  that 
appeared to be more accurate than dosing based on a patient’s clinical condition alone, and then 
increased or decreased the dose to achieve the optimal blood level.  NHLBI  launched the multicenter 
Clarification of Optimal Anticoagulation through Genetics (COAG)  clinical trial76 to compare the gene -
                                                 
76 For more information, see http://coagstudy.org/ .  
 70 based method with the current trial -and-error approach in a much wider pool of patients.  COAG will 
enroll 1,200 patients of varyi ng backgrounds at 12 sites and follow them for four  years. Its outcome 
could improve protection against heart attacks and strokes for millions of Americans.  
Widespread adoption of the electronic medical record (EMR) can potentially establish new frontiers for 
the use of genomics in medicine.  The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics  (eMERGE) Network , 
funded by NHGRI,  aims  to develop, disseminate, and apply research approaches that combine the use of 
large DNA collections (biorepositories) with EMR systems.  In doing so, this should enable large -scale, 
high -throughput genomic methods for use in clinical research and ongoing clinical care.  eMERGE is also 
studying the ethical, legal, and social issues involved in the use of EMRs for genomics research, s uch as 
privacy, confidentiality, and interactions with the public.  The eMERGE Network successfully 
accomplished its Phase I (2007 –2011) aims and has entered its Phase II (2011 –2015).  The key goal of 
eMERGE II is to explore the best avenues to incorporate g enetic variants into EMRs for use in clinical 
care among diverse populations.  To accomplish this, the Network expanded its member sites from five 
in Phase I to seven in Phase II to include racial/ethnic minorities and rural participants.  The number of 
stud y participants increased from approximately 19,000 to approximately 33,000.  
Maximizing human subject protection, while facilitating translational and applied clinical research, has 
become a critical challenge in the 21st century.  To increase the efficiency  and effectiveness of the 
clinical research enterprise, NIH is examining barriers to clinical research and striving to harmonize 
regulations and policies that pertain to its conduct and oversight.  As the lead federal agency supporting 
clinical research, NI H has an obligation  to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the clinical 
research enterprise by facilitating compliance and oversight.  
NCI is implementing changes to its Cooperative Groups Clinical Trials Program that will improve 
efficiency, oversi ght, and collaboration of trials, as recommended in an April 2010 Institute of Medicine 
report.  These changes include consolidation of the adult clinical trials groups; standardization of clinical 
trials data management software for NCI -sponsored multi -site trials; acceleration of clinical trial 
activation through the implementation of a real -time, internet -based dashboard containing clinical trial 
information for all parties involved in the process; collaboration with FDA scientists in NCI's disea se-
specific scientific steering committees; standardization of language for clinical trial and intellectual 
property agreements; improving funding of studies and increasing incentives for patient and physician 
participation by increasing per case reimburse ment rates; and developing a credentials registry for 
investigators and clinical trial sites . 
NIH also has specific initiatives to restructure the clinical trials enterprise in the area of oncology.  For 
example, the Standard Terms of Agreement for Research  Trials are designed to help cut the time spent 
on contract negotiations between pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies and academic medical 
centers.  In addition, NCI’s  Clinical Trials Reporting Program is establishing a comprehensive database 
containing r egularly updated information on all NCI -funded interventional clinical trials.  Grantees are 
requested to enter specific information about each clinical trial into the database.  This information will 
be used to coordinate research efforts to optimize the na tion’s investment in cancer research.  
 71 Collecting and sharing clinical research data requires large investments in time and resources, yet 
currently there is no uniform way to help investigators implement NIH data -sharing policies for research 
on neurologic al disorders.  In 2006, NINDS initiated an effort called Common Data Elements (CDEs)77 to 
address this issue for many different disease areas.  NINDS has worked with disease -specific experts and 
other stakeholders as part of this effort to develop standards to facilitate data collection, analysis and 
sharing across the research community.  To date, this effort has led to the development of a set of core 
data elements, and disease -specific elements for headache, spinal cord injury, stroke, epilepsy, 
Parkinson’s  disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, Friedrich’s ataxia, and multiple 
sclerosis, all of which are available on the website for use by investigators.  A working group is currently 
developing data elements for several neuromuscular d iseases, such as spinal muscle atrophy, Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy, traumatic brain injury, and myasthenia gravis.  
Sometimes it is  not clear which treatment or intervention is best for a patient in a given circumstance.  
NIH plays a critical and unique rol e for patients by sponsoring and funding research that compares 
different interventions or strategies to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor health conditions in real -
world setting s. Comparative effectiveness research (CER) improves health outcomes throu gh the 
development and dissemination of evidence -based information to patients, clinicians and decision -
makers about which interventions are most effective under certain circumstances.  One recently 
published CER trial compared Lucentis, a drug developed by  Genentech to treat wet age -related macular 
degeneration (AMD), and Avastin, a structurally related yet significantly less costly drug, also from 
Genentech, approved by the FDA for some cancers but commonly used ‘off -label’ for AMD. The two -
year NEI -funded  study found the drugs were equally effective for improving visual acuity, providing 
doctors and patients more options for treating AMD. Given that most AMD patients are over 65, CATT 
findings have important implications for Medicare  spending; t he US Offic e of the Inspector General 
(OIG) issued a report in September 2011 stating that Medicare  would have saved $1.4 billion in 2010 if 
all AMD patients had received Avastin . 
One of the most visible means by which NIH reaches, engages, and informs the patient an d medical 
health professional communit ies is through the congressionally mandated ClinicalTrials.gov Web site.  To 
enhance enrollment and provide a mechanism for tracking the progress of clinical trials, the FDA 
Amendments Act of 2007 [FDAAA, P.L. 110 -85] r equires “responsible parties” (sponsors or designated 
principal investigators) to register certain “applicable clinical trials” of FDA -regulated drugs, biological 
products, and devices with ClinicalTrials.gov no later than 21 days after enrolling the first  subject and to 
submit summary results information, including adverse -event information, no later than 12 months 
after the completion date of the trial if the drug, biological product, or device under study is approved, 
licensed, or cleared by FDA.  
Clinica lTrials.gov provides patients, family members, health care professionals, and other members of 
the public easy access to information on clinical studies on a wide range of diseases and conditions.  The 
information is provided and updated by the sponsor or principal investigator of the clinical study and the 
Web site is maintained by the NLM at NIH.  It has been integral to the implementation of policies and 
                                                 
77 For more information, see http://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/#page=Default .  
 72 other efforts to increase the transparency of clinical research.  It serves as a unique, publicly  acces sible 
resource that enables users to: 1) search for clinical trials of drugs, biologics, devices and other 
interventions (e.g., by condition, intervention, or sponsor) and obtain summary information about the 
studies (e.g., purpose, design, and facility lo cations); 2) track the progress of a study from initiation to 
completion; and 3) obtain summary research results, whether or not they have been published . The 
unique identifier assigned by ClinicalTrials.gov to each registered trial has become a de facto s tandard 
for identifying clinical trials and is widely and routinely used in medical journal articles, MEDLINE 
citations, congressional documents, and press releases.  
The existing ClinicalTrials.gov system  was expanded by NIH  to accept the registration and results 
information required to be submitted under FDAAA, making it  the largest , most heavily used  public 
research registry and results database in the world.   
Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Clinical Research  
The “efficacy -effectiveness” gap is a ter m used to show that interventions  that show benefit in clinical 
trials don’t always perform as well in the population at large.  One way of decreasing the “gap” includes 
taking steps to ensure the scientifically appropriate  inclusion  in a given study  of res earch participants 
are representative  of the population likely to use the  product if it is approved.  The NIH Revitalization Act 
of 1993 (Public Law 103 -43) requires that all NIH -funded clinical research include women and members 
of minority groups.  To meet  these statutory requirements, all NIH -funded clinical research is subject to 
the NIH Policy on the Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Subjects in Clinical Research .78 In 
accordance with the inclusion policy, investigators are required to describe what po pulations will be 
included in the proposed study, justify the exclusion of specific groups, and provide planned enrollment 
data . Scientific Review Groups assess proposed clinical research studies, consider whether sufficient 
information is provide d about planned  enrollment, and determine whether the recruitment and 
retention strategy is realistic.  Investigators are also required to  report annually their cumulative  
enrollment data indicating the sex/gender , race  and ethnicity of participants in each funded clinical 
research study . Inclusion enrollment data collected by each IC are compiled into the annual aggregate 
comprehensive report titled Monitoring Adherence to the NIH Policy on the Inclusion of Women and 
Minorities as Subjects in Clinical Research .79 The 2011 report indicates that in FY 2010, women 
constituted 56.1 percent of the 23.3 million participants in clinical studies, and 32.1 percent of 
participants identified themselves as members of an underrepresented race and/or ethnicity .  
Over the past two  years, NIH has focused on analyzing and streamlining the data reporting process, 
reemphasizing the vital role of NIH staff in monitor ing adherence to the NIH inclusion policy and 
management of grants, contracts, cooperative agreements , and intramural rese arch projects  involv ing 
human subjects.  The role of peer reviewers and investigators in meeting policy requirements continues 
to be emphasized .

 73 Postclinical Translational Research   
Postclinical translational research ensures  that evidence -based interventions are broadly applied and 
accessible to those who need them most.  NIH pursues this effort primarily through its support of health 
services research.  Health services research is a multidisciplinary field, both basic and appl ied, that 
examines how social factors, financing systems, organizational structures and processes, health 
technologies, and personal beliefs and behaviors affect access to and utilization of healthcare, the 
quality and cost of healthcare, and ultimately  our health and well -being.  The goals of health services 
research are to identify the most effective ways to organize, manage, finance, and deliver high -quality 
care.80 
NIH undertakes a number of activities to ensure that the rich evidence base created through  basic and 
clinical research is translated and utilized to enhance health and reduce the burdens of illness and 
disability.  The focus of health services research supported by NIH is on optimizing the health care 
delivery system to supply care based on scie ntific evidence.  As efficacious interventions are developed 
and tested, a more detailed understanding is needed to establish that they are effective in real world 
settings, including ensuring that they are adopted  and implemented appropriately, and with su stained 
investment.   
Health services research at NIH address es topics such as institutional and organizational influences on 
health, including studies of the organization of  and access to health care; its effectiveness in real world 
settings; its cost efficiency;  and its social and cultural acceptability.  It may also involve research related 
to macroeconomic phenomena (e.g., business cycles), community  and neighborhood organization , 
and the structure and functioning of families,  as well as  how these var iables influence the 
consumption  and choice of health care and decision -making concerning health procedures.  Finally, this 
category includes research on how successful approaches to the organization  and delivery of health 
services can be translated into pu blic policy.  
Partnering with Health Care Delivery Organizations  
Healthcare delivery organizations are critical partners with NIH efforts to study the methods and models 
for adopting and sustaining evidence -based interventions.  Through  research within actua l healthcare 
delivery settings, studies may provide crucial information that can help us deliver interventions faster 
and more effectively.  An additional benefit is having access to the immense resources that healthcare 
delivery organizations offer, such a s electronic medical records for thousands of patients.  Already a 
number of NIH Institutes support collaborative activities between healthcare delivery organizations such 
as health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and biomedical researchers to implement l arge studies 
with real -world benefits.

 74 Tackling real -world clinical issues and generating evidence that will be of immediate value to 
practitioners and patients is the central goal of the NIDCR -supported dental Practice -based Research 
Networks (PBRNs).  Conducting research in dental practices draws on the experience and insight of 
practicing clinicians to help identify and frame research questions.  Because PBRN studies address 
practice -based problems, their results tend to be more quickly translated into daily clinical care.   
Leveraging the infrastructure of established dental practices for conducting PBRN studies also can be a 
powerful and cost -effective means to conduct clinical research.  For example, the past decade brought 
reports that people who take bisphosphonates, a class of drug prescribed for osteoporosis or to treat 
the bone -wasting effects of cancer, can develop osteonecrosis (bone death) of the jaw.  To address the 
problem, the three regional PBRNs, taking advantage of their presence in practice s spanning multiple 
states, teamed up to carry out a collaborative study on osteonecrosis of the jaw . The study results, 
published in 2010, confirmed that bisphosphonate use is a risk factor for osteonecrosis of the jaw , and 
provided additional important e vidence to guide clinicians in their treatment of this challenging 
condition.  
The NCI  HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) consists of the research programs, enrolled populations, 
and data systems of 14 HMOs nationwide that, collectively, provide care to alm ost 11 million individuals.  
Co-funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, CRN research focuses on the 
characteristics of patients, clinicians, communities, and health systems that lead to the best possible 
outcomes in cancer prevention and care.  The CRN allows for large, multi -center, multidisciplinary 
intervention research that addresses the spectrum of cancer control, including studies of prevention, 
early detection, treatment, survivorship, surveillance, and end -of-life care.  The CRN also  develops and 
utilizes standardized approaches to data collection, data management, and analysis across 
health  systems.  CRN activities have generated more than 140 journal publications in a range of 
disciplines.   
In FY 2010, NIMH launched a major initiativ e, the Mental Health Research Network (MHRN), which 
connects nine established public domain research centers based in integrated, not -for-profit health care 
systems.  These systems provide care to a diverse population of 10 million people in 11 states, and they 
share rich and compatible data resources to support a wide range of effectiveness research.  Researchers 
have begun to use this network to address several important issues, including the development of a 
geographically and ethnically diverse autism spe ctrum disorder research registry; a pilot study for a new 
type of therapy for postpartum depression; and, a longitudinal analysis of how suicide warning labels on 
antidepressants affect later suicid e among youth.  
A new initiative of the NIH Common Fund in FY 2010, the Health Care Systems Collaboratory builds on 
these kinds of investments to create a large infrastructure that leverages the resources of healthcare 
delivery organizations to implement pragmatic research studies in real world health care deliver y 
settings.  This program develops networks of Health Care Delivery Systems to provide a framework of 
implementation of methods and best practices that will enable the participation of many health care 
systems in clinical research.   
 75 Disseminating and Implem enting Clinical Research Discoveries  
Dissemination and implementation research is intended to bridge the gap between clinical research and 
everyday practice by building a knowledge base that addresses how health information, interventions, 
and new clinical  practices are transmitted and translated for public health and health care service use in 
specific settings.  For example, NIDA  has created two implementation infrastructures, NIDA’s National 
Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) and the Crimi nal Justice -Drug Abuse Treatment 
Studies (CJ -DATS) to enhance the implementation of evidence -based substance abuse  and HIV screening 
and treatment in terventions in community treatment programs  and the criminal justice system, 
respectively.  CTN is exemplary  of efforts to translate research into practice, testing feasibility and 
measuring variables tied to implementation success.  This research infrastructure promotes feedback 
from multiple stakeholders, which is then integrated to improve drug abuse and addic tion treatments, 
making them more feasible  and readily available to those who need them.  Similarly, CJ -DATS tests 
evidence -based approaches and innovative implementation strategies within the criminal justice system 
as well as upon re -entry into the community.   
Tackling real -world clinical issues and generating evidence that will be of immediate value to 
practitioners and patients is the central goal of the NIDCR -supported dental Practice -based Research 
Networks (PBRNs).  Conducting research in dental practices draws on the experience and insight of 
practicing clinicians to help identify and frame research questions.  Because PBRN studies address 
practice -based problems, their results tend to be more quickly translated into daily clinical care.   
Leveragi ng the infrastructure of established dental practices for conducting PBRN studies also can be a 
powerful and cost -effective means to conduct clinical research.  For example, the past decade brought 
reports that people who take bisphosphonates, a class of dr ug prescribed for osteoporosis or to treat 
the bone -wasting effects of cancer, can develop osteonecrosis (bone death) of the jaw.  To address the 
problem, the three regional PBRNs, taking advantage of their presence in practices spanning multiple 
states, te amed up to carry out a collaborative study on osteonecrosis of the jaw . The study results, 
published in 2010, confirmed that bisphosphonate use is a risk factor for osteonecrosis of the jaw , and 
provided additional important evidence to guide clinicians in  their treatment of this challenging 
condition.  
To date, nearly 1,000 practitioner -investigators have participated in network projects, and over 30,000 
patients from their practices have been enrolled in more than 30 different PBRN studies.  These studies 
include comparisons of the benefits of a variety of dental procedures, dental materials, and diagnostic 
strategies for patients with diverse clinical conditions.  Individual studies have addressed, for example, 
controlling pain associated with root canal th erapy, improving dental restorations, and testing the 
feasibility of measuring blood glucose levels in dental practice.  
In another example, the NIDDK supports translational research efforts to develop affordable , scalable 
adaptations of the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial, which found that a 
lifestyle intervention could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by 58 percent in people at risk. While the 
original DPP lifestyle intervention was fou nd to be cost -effective, providing it to a significant fraction of 
 76 the 79 million Americans estimated to have pre -diabetes requires still greater efficiency. The positive 
effects of the DPP continue as new research, building on the study’s results, seek th e most effective 
ways to prevent, delay, or even reverse diabetes.  Subsequent  NIDDK -funded  translational  research 
effort s utilize d local Ys (formerly YMCAs) for delivering a group -based adaptation of the DPP lifestyle 
intervention. A pilot study showed th at this group -based approach reduces costs to deliver the 
intervention, while achieving similar levels of weight loss in participants; a larger trial is ongoing.  Based 
on evidence from this clinical and translational  research, the CDC, in partnership with the Y and 
UnitedHealth Group, launched the National Diabetes Prevention Program.81 Efforts to scale and sustain 
the National Diabetes Prevention Program continue as a growing number of programs offer the lifestyle 
change program nationwide. Organizations of fering a lifestyle change program consistent with the 
Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program Standards and Operating Procedures  can participate in CDC’s 
Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program. Organizations are recognized by CDC for achieving results 
that are consistent with what research showed to be effective in preventing type 2 diabetes . 
In addition, the NIH Office of Medical Applications of Research82 works closely with ICs to assess, 
translate, and disseminate the results of biomedical research th at can be used in the delivery of health 
services.  OMAR coordinates periodic consensus conferences with the goal of reviewing areas of NIH -
supported research where there may be a gap between research accomplishments and clinical care.  To 
date, NIH has cond ucted more than 120 consensus development conferences and 30 state -of-the-
science conferences.  Consensus and state -of-the-science statements are disseminated widely after the 
conference either to modify clinical practice when evidence strongly supports usi ng or not using a 
particular intervention or to direct future research when important gaps in knowledge have been 
identified.  The consensus statements that result from these conferences are shared widely with 
healthcare providers, policymakers, patients, a nd the media.  
Health Economics Research  
Economic  factors  are major  drivers  in healthcare  delivery  and thus  affect  the translation  of biomedical  
research  findings  into health  improvements.  NIH supports  research  designed  to understand  these  
factors,  such  as, for example,  financing  and reimbursement  issues  related  to the adoption  and 
sustainability  of newly  developed  interventions.  Under  the Common  Fund,  the Health Economics 
Program  aims to support basic and applied research to understand how  innovations in treatments, 
diagnosis, and preventative strategies can be most effectively implemented in a health care setting, so 
that past and future investments by NIH may have greater impact .  
Results from health services research can inform the entir e healthcare sector (clinicians, hospitals, 
insurers, public health and community centers, and policymakers) about  the most efficient and effective 
means of preventions, screening, and treatment, and opportunities for improvement .

 77 Information at the Ser vice of Health   
NIH has a long history of translating scientific findings into useful information for the public, physicians, 
nurses, caregivers, and others.  NIH partnerships and communication strategies are designed to 
accomplish this economically and effectively.  Health information developed by the NIH is based on peer -
reviewed, cutting -edge science and is designed to me itsc\whiet the needs of the community as well as  
to be easily accessed and understood.  One primary goal of NIH communications efforts is to maintain 
relevance and credibility with target audiences amid rapidly changing expectations and media formats.  
Products are also designed to reach audiences who are more affected by a specific risk, disease, or 
disorder.  Through their campaigns and c learinghouses, NIH com munications offices continue to respond 
to changes in health and science communications , such as how audiences obtain health and science 
information.  The ultimate goal is to broaden participation in research and improve health outcome s, 
especially in medically underserved communities.   
The translation and transfer of research knowledge and clinical trial findings to hospitals, doctors’ 
office s, and community settings are of the utmost importance.  NIH nurtures strategies that bring basi c 
research discoveries and clinical research into practice.  For instance, in 2011 NHLBI released the 
Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk reduction in Children and Adolescents, which 
contains evidence -based recommendations on the preven tion and management of risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease, and is directed toward all primary pediatric care providers —pediatricians, family 
practitioners, nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and registered dietitians.  In another 
example, the NIH MedlinePlus magazine and its bilingual Spanish counterpart NIH Medline Plus Salud 
are quarterly consumer magazines focused on bringing the latest clinical findings to patients and their 
families. The magazines are complementary to the MedlinePlus and MedlinePlus en español Web sites, 
and they are distributed to the public via doctors’ offices nationwide.  
The Challenge of Patient Recruitment for Clinical Trials  
The public relies on physicians for information and guidance.  Physicia ns also play a pivotal role in 
informing, recruiting, and enrolling participants in clinical research trials.  Although volunteers in clinical 
research are more important than ever before, most  Americans have never participated in clinical 
research.  There a re several contributing factors behind this, including:  
 Many doctors do not suggest clinical research studies to their patients.  
 Some individuals may not realize there are a number of possible ways they can contribute to 
research other than as a patient . For example, people  may  serve as healthy subjects or simply  
take a survey online.   
 Potential participants may not realize they can volunteer directly to be participants in clinical 
research.   
 78  Disease stigma may affect recruitment in those studies that are f ocused on infectious diseases 
or mental health conditions.  
 Many people  do not fully understand what a research study is or how one is carried out.  Others 
may not trust a study’s designers or how the study will be conducted.  Potential participants may 
not b e convinced of the confidentiality of individual patient data .  
 Surveys have shown that most American adults have difficulty using everyday health 
information to make good health decisions.  Information about a trial may too technical to be 
easily understoo d, and forms, such as consent documents , may be too complicated for some 
individuals to understand and fill out.   
 Individuals may face any number of logistical challenges, such as transportation, child care, or 
time constraints from shift work.   
Trans -NIH Spotlight:  Clinical Research Awareness  
To address these issues , NIH IC communicators , under the direction of the NIH Office of 
Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL),  are working to raise awareness among the general public 
and the medical community of 1) the importance of NIH -supported clinical research to public health; 2) 
the pressing need for clinical trial participants; and 3) the benefits of clinical trial partici pation for public 
health.   
NIH Clinical Research Trials and You . NIH recently launched the cornerstone of a new crosscutting 
program, a Web -based educational site called NIH Clinical Research Trials and You , developed to help 
people learn more about clinic al trials, why they matter, and how to participate.  In launching the Web 
site (http://clinicalresearch.nih.gov/ ), NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., said, "The ability to 
recruit the necessary number of volunteers is vital to carrying out clinic al research that leads to health 
and medical advances.  This new, centralized resource will make it much easier for the public and health 
professionals to learn about clinical trials and how people can participate in them."  Most important ly, 
resources devel oped from the  NIH Clinical Research Trials and You  campaign are designed to be useful 
to physicians both at NIH and at NIH -supported sites.  
The NIH Clinical Research Trials and You  resource features information about participating in clinical 
trials , as well as first hand experiences from actual clinical trial volunteers and explanations from 
researchers.  There are also links on the Web site for locating or enrolling in programs.  Health care 
professionals can 1) read about evidence -based strategies for talking with patients about trials, 2) print 
audience -tested posters to help promote trials in clinics and offices, and 3) find other clinical trial 
educational materials.   
Clearly there is value to federal collaborations and partnerships with communit ies and stakeholders 
involved in and/or affected by NIH research.  The NIH Clinical Research Trials and You  site therefore 
seeks to promote  development of  appropriate  partnerships with NIH grantees and other stakeholders to 
assist with a comprehensive aware ness -building initiative.  To ensure that physicians are aware of their 
 79 key role in clinical trial recruitment,  NIH communications offices are working  to increase coordination 
with their external partners and between each other, taking advantage of social m edia tools to raise 
physician awareness about clinical research.   
NIH is working with s chools to incorporat e discoveries from  clinical research in to science education 
programs.  NIH also offers story -based features about clinical research  to the media . The 2011 launch of 
NIH Clinical Research Trials and You received coverage by media outlets from  Connecticut to California.  
NIH is developing  podcasts and other audiovisual resources , making them  free and eas ily reproduc ible in 
media outlets.  The agency is also  taking this resource to the community, by sharing and promoting the 
Web site and clinical research at events, such as parenting fairs and employee events  and in 
announcements  to state public health departments, requesting that state officials share the re sources 
with their own stakeholders.  Recently, NIH, through OCPL and the NIH Office of Science Policy, entered 
into an arrangement with the American Medical Association (AMA) to promote the NIH Clinical Research 
Trials and You initiative to the organizatio n’s 17,000 member physicians.   
Highlighted Institute and Center Communication Programs  
Millions of Americans search daily online for answers to health related questions, and they look to NIH 
for authoritative, reliable, research -based health information.  NIH communicators at the agency’s 27 
Institutes and Centers continue to build on their proven track record of award -winning public education 
and awareness campaigns directed at a variety of audiences.  Trans -agency efforts originating from NIH 
campaigns and  clearinghouses are also designed to increase visibility of NIH as a leader in the support 
and conduct of clinical research in an era of personalized medicine.  
A listing of featured health awareness, prevention, and treatment campaigns sponsored by the NIH  is 
online at http://www.nih.gov/icd/od/ocpl/resources/campaigns/ . Many campaigns target specific 
audiences for prevention and treatment efforts.  Others are focused on a specific behaviora l health 
outcome  such as  early diagnosis; decreased morbidity and mortality; family history, genetics, and 
genomics; infectious disease control and the need for vaccines; delivery of quality health care to people 
with special needs; diet and nutrition; and  improved and refined health care practices.  Several ICs, 
through campaigns, sponsor clearinghouses for easy  access to research -based materials.  A sampling of 
NIH campaigns and clearinghouses follows.  
Alcohol and other drugs . NIAAA sponsors a number of efforts designed to address drinking, including an 
underage -drinking research initiative, an information campaign focused on college drinking, and the 
Institute’s Rethinking Drinking  initiative, which features evidence -based information about risky drinkin g 
patterns in U.S. adults, as well as support for cutting back or quitting.  NIAAA also disseminates evidence -
based guidelines to health practitioners for screening and intervening with youth and adults. NIDA 
sponsors several cutting -edge awareness efforts for different audiences, directed at the costly 
nationwide drug problem.  One core audience for several of NIDA’s campaigns is teens.  For example, 
NIDA recently launched an interactive Web -based initiative called PEERx  to educate teens and help them 
spread the word about the dangers of  prescription drug abuse.  In 2010, NIDA launched National Drug 
Facts Week, a health observance week targeting teens with scientific information to shatter commo n 
 80 myths about drugs. In November 2011, about 165 events were held in 47 states, and more than 166,000 
teens received NIDA’s teen booklet  titled  “Drugs: Shatter the Myths. ” NIDA also continues to promote 
tools and educational resources for healthcare professionals through its NIDAMED initiative, designed  to 
help clinicians identify patients with substance abuse problems , prevent their escalation  to addiction, 
and refer patients to treatment as necessary . 
Aging.  A national campaign , Go4Life , was  develop ed by the NIA to encourage adults age 50 and older to 
make exercise and physical activity a regular part of their everyday lives.  The interactive Go4Life  Web 
site features specific exercises, success stories, motivational tips, and nutrition information.  Free 
materials include print publications, an exercise DVD, and online tip sheets.83 In addition, 
NIHSeniorHealth .gov  Web site was recently redesigned and updated to accommodate older Americans’ 
increased understanding and use of the Internet.  Developed by the NIA and the NLM, 
NIHSeniorHealth.gov makes aging -related health information easily accessible for family members and 
friends seeking reliable, easy to understand online health information.  The site’s design and content 
were guided by NIA's research on the types of cognitive changes that are a part of the normal aging 
process.  
Cancer.  NCI sponsors a number of educational and awareness efforts designed to address cancer 
prevention through adoption of a healthy lifestyle and diet.  Through its campaigns and  clearinghouses, 
NCI also offers cancer clinical trial resources, training programs focused on palliative and end -of-life 
care, and other activities and tools.  In 2009, NCI expanded its  Smokefree campaign to include a 
dedicated section and companion Facebo ok page , specifically targeting women.  Included in the program 
are resources and information to help women integrate smoking cessation into daily life and family 
matters. NCI als o contributed Surviving Cancer —a section devoted to providing resources and 
information to older adult cancer survivors and their families to the NIHSeniorHealth.gov website.   
Children’s health.  NICHD sponsors a number of programmatic efforts to address children’s health.  For 
parents, family members, health care workers, and caregiv ers, the NICHD Back to Sleep  campaign offers 
information kits, professional education materials, and other resources aimed at reducing the risk for 
sudden infant death syndrome.  Milk Matters  is an NICHD public health education campaign designed to 
promote calcium for healthy bone growth  in tweens and teens.  
We Can!  is a national education program designed to provide parents, caregivers, and youth with 
reliable, authoritative information designed to help children ages 8 –13 maintain a healthy weight.  More 
than 40 national organizations have partnered with We Can!  to help spread the program’s science -based 
materials and messages through community outreach, a museum exhibit, in -person training programs, 
information dissemination, and a new interactive cu rriculum.  Three key behavioral goals form the 
foundation of We Can!  program messages —improving food choices, increasing physical activity, and 
reducing screen time.  We Can!  has grown from 14 founding sites to more than 1,600 communities in all 
50 states, P uerto Rico, and 13 countries around the world.

 81 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . COPD is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. and 
is estimated to affect 24 million across the nation , with  as many as half undiagnosed.  To address this 
serious lung disease, the NIH developed the COPD Learn More Breathe Better® campaign.  The program is 
designed to help  at-risk men and women over age 45 recognize the signs and symptoms of COPD and 
motivate them to talk with their health car e providers about testing and treatment options.  The 
campaign also gives  health care providers information about incidence, early detection, and treatments.  
Through a network of 74 national and local partners conducting COPD outreach in 47 states, the 
prog ram sponsors community -level outreach and events, media outreach efforts, social -media 
strategies, and continuing development of partnerships.   
Diabetes . In collaboration with over 200 public and private partners, the NIDDK and CDC co -led National 
Diabetes  Education Prog ram (NDEP )84 disseminates  evidence -based educational materials on diabetes.  
For example, the NDEP encourages people to take “small steps” to prevent type 2 diabetes.  The NDEP 
also promotes the importance of comprehensive diabetes control in i ts “Control Your Diabetes. For Life” 
educational campaign.  Campaign materials are tailored for minority groups at high risk of developing 
type 2 diabetes. The NIDDK’s National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse  also provide key health 
information for patie nts, healthcare professionals, and the general public.  
Environmental health.  The NIEHS -led Partnerships for Environmental Public Health (PEPH)85 program 
focuses on conducting and translating research into action to address the effects of environmental 
exposures and health risks of concern to the public and particularly affected communities. PEPH is a 
network that brings together scientists, communi ty members, educators, health care providers, public 
health officials, and policy makers in the shared goal of advancing the impact of environmental public 
health research at local, regional, and national levels.  
Eye health and vision.  The National Eye Hea lth Education Program  (NEHEP) , a campaign of NEI, is a 
public and professional education campaign focused on early detection and timely treatment of 
glaucoma and diabetic eye disease and appropriate treatment for low vision.  The NEHEP contains a 
series of websites that include information on specific diseases and issues with resources available to 
patients and the public.  The Healthy Vision Program provides the public with information about eye 
health in order to promoted community outreach , and the Healthy  Vision Community Awards Program 
provides seed money to promote these efforts.  The Healthy Eyes Toolkit includes resources and 
materials to promote public education on vision and eye health and includes fact sheets, e -cards 
stickers , and web links to promo te regular eye exams.   
Hearing.  In October 2008, NIDCD launched It's a Noisy Planet. Protect Their Hearing . The Noisy Planet 
campaign is designed to increase awareness among parents of children age d 8 to 12 ("tweens") about 
the causes and prevention of noise -induced hearing loss, or NIHL.  With this information, parents and 
other caring adults can encourage children to adopt healthy habits that will help them protect their 
hearing for life.

 82 Health di sparities.  NIH has many outreach activities to address health disparities.  For example, the  
NIAMS Health Partnership Program is a community -based, collaborative research program between 
NIAMS and Washington, D.C. area community organizations.  Through resea rch with underrepresented 
patients affected by arthritis and other rheumatic diseases, the program studies health disparities and 
their causes, and provides direction for improving the health status and outcomes of affected minority 
communities.  Its Commun ity Health Center, located in Silver Spring, Maryland, gives the community 
access to specialized care and health information, and provides NIH researchers with access to patients 
most affected by rheumatic diseases.  
The NIAMS National Multicultural Outrea ch Initiative, an outgrowth of the NIAMS local Health 
Partnership Program, aims to help address disparities in the availability and access to research -based 
and culturally relevant health information among various multicultural groups.  Through culturally 
targeted health planners, people from multicultural backgrounds who have diseases and conditions of 
the bones, joints, muscles, and skin can learn about available resources from NIAMS, NIH, and other 
federal agencies that can help people cope with their chr onic disease or condition to improve their 
quality of life.   
Heart health.  In 2011, NHLBI released the Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk 
reduction in Children and Adolescents, which contains evidence -based recommendations on the 
prevention and management of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and is directed towards all 
primary pediatric care providers –pediatricians, family practitioners, nurses and nurse practitioners, 
physician assistants, and registered dietitians.  
Kidney disease.  The NIDDK’s National Kidney D isease Education Program (NKDEP86) is designed to raise 
awareness about the problem of kidney disease and steps that should be taken to treat chronic kidney 
disease and prevent kidney failure.  It represents a major educ ational outreach effort to patients, 
physicians, and the public.  In October 2010, NKDEP hosted a meeting titled “Translating Chronic Kidney 
Disease Research into Improved Clinical Outcomes .” Several planning grants were funded as a result of 
this meeting.  
Oral health and oral cancer.  African American men are one of the groups at  highest risk for oral cancer, 
but many don't know it.  Are You at Risk for Oral Cancer?  What African American Men Need to Know , a 
campaign from NIDCR and NCI, is designed to promote early detection of oral cancer among African 
American men.  Campaign materials include a video, radio PSAs, a brochure, a card describing the oral 
cancer exam, posters, and a fact sheet.  Promotion has involved, for example, distributing campaign kits 
to African American community cancer programs, sending the PSAs to African American  radio stations 
around the country, and outreach to the press.  
Stroke.  NINDS continues to develop and manage the Institute’ s groundbreaking public education 
campaign:  Know Stroke: Know the Signs. Act in Time . The campaign was designed to help increase 
knowledge and awareness about the early warning signs and symptoms of stroke and to drive behavior 
change, especially in at -risk communities.  It includes outreach to consumers and health care 
                                                 
86 For more information, see http://nkdep.nih.gov/ .  
 83 professionals using mass media, social media, grassroots partnerships and community education.  Since 
2004, the Know Stroke  campaign has focused on the grassroots Know Stroke in the Community 
initiative.  The foundation for this initiative is community engagement in “train the trainer” programs in 
major urban areas across the U.S. using NINDS materials to educate local high risk audiences including 
African Americans, Hispanics, and people over t he age of 50 and their family members, caregivers and 
health care providers.  NINDS has also partnered with the General Federation of Women’s Clubs creating 
a nationwide network of volunteers; and with the National Council of La Raza in the development and 
promotion of culturally appropriate materials for Spanish audiences including a video, flipchart and 
toolkit.  Going forward, NINDS has initiated a partnership with the AHA to coordinate a national 
distribution of the NINDS -developed Hispanic education tool kits through health educators and 
community outreach workers in local communities across the country.  
NIH communication strategies  and efforts  translate scientific findings  to be easily accessed and 
understood  for broad audiences. NIH also maintain s relevance and credibility with the public by using 
multiple media formats and design information  to reach audiences who are more affected by a specific 
disease or risk . Through out changes in health and science communications , NIH communication offices 
utilize campaigns and clearinghouses to continue to broaden participation in research and improve 
health outcomes, especially in medically underserved communities.   
  
 84 Harnessing Technology   
In today’s world, technolog ical advances  move at an unprecedented pace.  NIH is tapping into this  
technological revolution in multiple ways, from fostering  new technological advances for rapid data 
collection and sharing huge amounts of data, to developing new technologies to better detect and tr eat 
numerous  diseases  and disorders , and to ensuring that  research  results —from scientific publications to 
patient an d consumer health information —are readily available to all.   
NIH support of technology development continues to trigger revolutions in the understanding of health 
and disease.  In recent years, biotechnology and nanotechnology have undergone extensive 
development  and expansion . Biotechnology combines disciplines such as genetics, molecular biology, 
biochemistry, embryology, and cell biology, which in turn are linked to disciplines such as information 
technology, robotics, and bioengineering to enable the development of new or enhanced tools and 
devices to further basic scientific research as well as lead to improvements in human health.  
Nanote chnology research takes advantage of the phenomenon that the properties of some materials 
change significantly at very small scales, often with surprisingly useful consequences.  NIH-supported 
nanotechnology research exploits this phenomenon in efforts to d evelop devices with unique features 
for diagnosing and treating disease.  It is a highly multidisciplinary field, drawing from disciplines  such as 
applied physics, materials science, supramolecular chemistry, and mechanical and electrical engineering.  
Many  of the core challenges in today’s research require technologies, databases, and other scientific 
resources that are more sensitive, robust, and easily adaptable to unique applications than what 
currently exists . New technologies are needed, for example, to develop a more detailed understanding 
of the vast networks of molecules that make up cells and tissues, their interactions, and their regulation; 
to develop a more precise knowledge of the combined effects of environmental exposures, individual 
susceptib ility, and molecular events at the onset of disease; and to capitalize on the completion of the 
human genome sequence and recent discoveries in molecular and cell biology.  Moreover, wide spread  
access to such tools will be essential for moving these fields forward .  
The development, deployment, and utilization of biomedical information systems (i.e., disease registries 
and other  databases ) are essential to managing large amounts of data for research, clinical care, and 
public health.  Increasingly, these tech nologies serve not only as repositories of information but also as 
research tools in and of themselves, extending , and in some cases , augmenting the laboratory.  For 
example, scientists are able to  use molecular databases to study the profiles of individual  tumors and 
conceptualize small -molecule anticancer agents to target them.  However, n ew analytical tools are 
needed to explore increasingly complex questions, such as how the expression patterns of multiple 
genes are associated with a particular trait or r esponse.  Tools such as this are most effective when these 
databases are interoperable and capable of  communicat ing with each other  and make use of similar 
software applications.  NIH is also keenly attuned to the importance and challenges associated with 
preserving, protecting, and ensuring the validity and security of information stored in biomedical 
databases.  
 85 NIH supports technology development through several complementary approaches, including:  
 Research project grants with a sound basis in preliminary  data, directed at development of a 
particular technology; some projects may take only a few years while others continue for a 
decade or more.  
 Bioengineering research partnerships, which bring together multiple disciplines  in the physical 
and life science s such as engineering, cell biology, physics, and neurology to develop solutions to 
specific biomedical questions or diseases.  
 Specialized centers that represent a critical mass of expertise and technology, in which 
multidisciplinary development of comple x, often unique technologies is pursued, typically in the 
context of challenging research problems that cannot be approached with existing tools.  
 Small business grants through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business 
Technology Tra nsfer (STTR) programs for highly innovative projects to bring technological 
advances into the marketplace for the broadest possible availability and impact.  These programs 
allow NIH to leverage the unique resources and perspectives available in the private  sector to 
complement the work done at universities and the NIH intramural program.  
 High -risk, innovative projects with little preliminary indication of the likelihood of success, 
although they may have a potentially significant impact if successful.  These  proof -of-principle 
projects usually have small budgets and short timeframes.  
The research pipeline is replete with examples of NIH’s commitment to technology development, its 
foresight in identifying emerging needs and promising areas of investigation, an d its ability to foster the 
development of technology that links basic research with clinical applications.   
Harnessing the power of the Internet create s unprecedented access to health care information in 
patient files as well as to raw research data from clinical trials.  For health science researchers, shared 
virtual libraries provide access to data and images from hundreds of studies in various fields.  Devising 
the infrastructure to support a seamless end -user environment requires the collaboration of a h ost of 
professionals in computer science, medicine, records management, and other related fields.  
NIH-supported efforts are affecting how healthcare providers, patients, and researchers will use 
information technology in the future.  One such endeavor allo ws patients to access their own health 
information.  Complete access to diagnostic results and treatment details will permit patients to play an 
active role in their own healthcare decision -making by asking more informed questions about their care.  
Patients  will be able to provide this information to any healthcare provider regardless of where they are 
located.  NIH supports research to ensure that the data are secure during storage and transmission and 
to address compliance with the Health Insurance Portabil ity and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  Benefits of 
this approach include a reduction in medical errors and elimination of duplicative diagnostic procedures.  
Next -generation healthcare will offer consumers ultrasensitive technologies and techniques to assess 
normal and diseased states of the body coupled with quick access to vast amounts of health -related 
 86 data.  New modes of collecting patient information, such as the Patient -Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS), may improve  how patients provide information on their 
conditions and how doctors use that information in treatment decisions.  An online computer -adaptive 
testing system, PROMIS records patient reports of symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and emotional 
distress related to a wide variety of chronic diseases and conditions.  
Because of the growing importance of information and its management in biomedical science, clinical 
care, and public health, virtually every NIH IC is engaged in the development, deployment, and use of  
biomedical information systems that support its mission.  NIH databases and information systems have 
become indispensable national and international resources for biomedical research and public health.  
Several trans -NIH activities feature the development o f significant biomedical information resources, 
including the tools, infrastructure, and associated research needed to make databases and registries 
more valuable.   
NIH efforts to develop and deploy disease registries, databases, and biomedical information  systems to 
advance biomedical science, health, and healthcare focus on:  
 Scientific databases.  These databases archive and provide access to authoritative scientific 
literature, essential research data (including disease -specific data), and clinical resea rch 
information.  
 Genomic information systems.  Major systems include GenBank for genomic sequence data and 
dbGaP (database of Genotype and Phenotype) for GWAS data.  
 Disease registries and surveillance systems.  NIH works with other federal and private enti ties to 
integrate disease registries for national and local use.  For example, the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program in the NCI has been the foundation for 
innumerable studies, including recent research into links between hormone th erapy and breast 
cancer.  
In order to make these and other data systems more useful to researchers, clinicians, and the public, 
NIH invests in a number of activities, including the following:  
 Standardized vocabularies and data protocols.  NIH leads the government’s efforts to develop 
standardized vocabularies and terminology to support interoperability among biomedical 
information systems in research and clinical settings.  
 Large -scale informatics infrastructure.  NIH funds the development o f large -scale systems and 
tools that allow communities of researchers to collect, share, and analyze data needed for 
research, clinical care (including electronic health records), and public health.  
 Biomedical informatics research and training.  NIH is the  largest federal funder of biomedical 
informatics research, which aims to advance the applications of computing to biomedicine for 
both research and clinical care. NLM supports research in biomedical informatics and training 
for informatics researchers and  information specialists.  
 87 Catalog of Disease Registry, Database, and Biomedical Information System Activities  
In response to the mandate under SEC. 403 (a)(4)(C)(ii) of the Public Health Service Act to provide 
catalogs of disease registries and other data  systems, Appendix G  is included  with  an inventory of NIH 
intramural and extramural activities ongoing in FYs 2010 and 2011 to develop or maintain databases, 
disease registries, and other information resources for the benefit of the larger research community.   
NIH Scientific Databases: Enhanc ing Access to Research Information  
Keeping pace with the expanding volume of biomedical knowledge is a continuing challenge for 
scientists, clinicians, policymakers, and the public; thus, NIH devotes considerable attention and 
resources to developing, expa nding, and maintaining tools and resources for information management.  
Biomedical databases store and provide access to a wide range of information, from the results of 
scientific or clinical research studies, to genomic information, to standard reference materials (such as 
genome sequences or anatomical images), and to published journal articles and citations to the medical 
literature.  They are widely used by biomedical researchers, as well as by a growing number of clinicians, 
public health officials, and  consumers.  NIH often undertakes special initiatives to make these resources 
more accessible to a broader, more diverse set of users.  
Among the most widely used of NIH’s databases are those that collect and provide access to scientific 
literature . These co mprehensive resources are used extensively by scientists, health care providers, and 
consumers who seek trusted, peer -reviewed information on biomedical and health topics of interest.  
NIH houses the leading source of authoritative biomedical literature for  professional and lay audiences.  
The exhaustive PubMed database comprises more than 21 million citations for biomedical literature 
from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books.  
In addition, NIH continues to expand PubMed Central (PMC), its digita l archive of full -text scientific 
journal articles.  PMC was established to provide online access to a growing number of scientific journal 
articles deposited by publishers and NIH -funded researchers, and now provides public access to more 
than 2. 5 million research articles.  Some of this increase is attributable to an expanding scope of user  
(not just biomedical researchers, but also clinicians, other practitioners, and consumers ) that  highlights 
the importance of this type of resource.  
PMC serves as the rep ository for manuscripts submitted in accordance with the NIH Public Access Policy, 
which ensures that the public and the scientific community have access to the published results of NIH -
funded research by requiring NIH -funded scientists to submit final pee r-reviewed journal manuscripts 
that arise from NIH funds to PMC.  PMC software also is used by funding agencies in other countries to 
establish repositories for their funded research.  
NIH also puts effort into developing and maintaining information systems  that collect data stemming 
from biomedical research . These systems organize data, and make it accessible for subsequent research.  
NIH’s PubChem database, for example, houses the voluminous data on molecular structures and 
functions that is produced throug h NIH funding under the Molecular Libraries Initiative of the NIH 
Common Fund . It provides information about the biological activity of small molecules, organized as 
 88 three linked databases along with a chemical structure similarity search tool.  PubChem now  contains 
more than 3 5 million unique chemical structures and more than 600,000  bioassays.  PubChem is 
integrated with NIH’s Entrez suite of biomedical information resources, an integrated collection of some 
40 databases and  more than  570 million records of molecular and genomic data.  This integration 
enables users to retrieve related data from multiple databases and navigate among them with relative 
ease.  
Individual Institutes also support efforts to integrate the enormous data strea ms for the benefit of 
catalyzing research in certain diseases and disorders. For example, NIDCR supports  the FaceBase 
Consortium , creating a freely available database compiling the biological and genetic instructions to 
construct the middle region of the h uman face.  FaceBase will facilitate data production and integration, 
as well as accelerate translational and clinical application of this knowledge for the prevention, 
treatment, and management of craniofacial birth defects.  FaceBase’s individual scientifi c projects 
continue to provide data to the FaceBase data integration and management hub; the hub’s informatics 
development team is creating new interfaces for displaying and searching those data on the 
consortium’s W eb site, www.facebase.org.  
Genomic Infor mation Systems: Understanding the Genetic Basis of Disease  
NIH has made great strides in developing information resources to support genetics research.  
Considerable effort has been aimed at supporting the analysis of data from GWAS, which explore the 
conne ction between specific genes (genotype information) and observable diseases or conditions 
(phenotype information, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or obesity).  NIH’s dbGaP (database of 
Genotype and Phenotype) houses data from a number of GWAS, includ ing those funded by NIH.  NIH’s 
GWAS policy encourages NIH grantees to submit their GWAS data to dbGaP and establishes procedures 
for making it available to other researchers to speed up disease gene discovery while at the same time 
protecting the privacy o f research subjects in genomics studies.  
In addition, several NIH ICs have established genetics repositories to accelerate research and 
multidisciplinary collaborations in specific disease areas.  Programs such as the NEI eyeGENE, NIMH 
Center for Collabora tive Genetic Studies on Mental Disorders , the NIDA Center for Genetic Studies, the 
NINDS Human Genetics Repository, the NIEHS Chemical Effects in Biological Systems (CEBS) Knowledge 
Base, and the NIA Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site give r esearchers access to vast 
storehouses of genetic and genomic data, DNA samples, and clinical data, along with informatics tools 
designed to facilitate their analyses.  The wide availability of information linking genotype to phenotype 
should help researcher s better understand gene -based diseases and speed development of effective 
therapies.  
Disease Registries and Surveillance Systems: Tracking and Monitoring Disease  
Disease registries collect information about the occurrence of specific diseases, such as can cer and 
Parkinson’s disease, the kinds of treatment that patients receive, and other information that might be 
relevant to researchers or public health officials.  Increasingly, disease registries also include genomic 
data from registered patients.  Registry  information can therefore help identify causal factors of disease, 
 89 assess the effectiveness of various interventions, and identify questions of concern to researchers, 
clinical professionals, and policymakers.  
Disease registries have been employed for res earch on autoimmune disorders, including Sj ögren’s 
Syndrome, one of the most prevalent.  A significant roadblock for moving discoveries ahead in the field 
of Sj ögren’s Syndrome is a lack of data and biospecimens available for research.  Recognizing the 
probl em, NIH spearheaded an effort to establish patient registries at two extramural institutions, as well 
as through its own intramural program.  These groups work together to generate and share genome -
wide genotyping data and clinical information from the coho rts enrolled through these efforts with the 
general research community.  
Registries also provide a valuable source of information for tracking the effectiveness of particular 
treatments or interventions.  The Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted C irculatory Support 
(INTERMACS), for example, is a national registry for patients who are receiving mechanical circulatory 
support device therapy to treat advanced heart failure.  The registry is supported jointly by NIH, FDA, and 
CMS.  Use of standardized te rminologies helps ensure that the data collected will facilitate improved 
patient evaluation and management while aiding in better device development.  
Standardized Vocabularies, Data Protocols, and Tools  
NIH continues to invest in tools that can increase the utility of its scientific databases and medical 
information sources.  A key component of such efforts relates to the development and maintenance of 
standards and vocabularies for use in information systems used for research and clinical care, including 
electronic health records.  Standard vocabularies and ontologies (models of the relationships between 
concepts) improve information search, retrieval, and exchange by endowing systems with the ability to 
automatically perceive and retrieve information about  related terms.  As expansion of scientific frontiers 
produces new concepts, terms, and relationships, standard vocabularies must be regularly revised so 
that articles and other data can be properly indexed and search engines can find relevant and related 
terms.  
NIH continues to update the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), which is used heavily in 
advanced biomedical research and data mining worldwide.  The UMLS Metathesaurus, with more than 
8.6 million concept names from 161 source vocabularies, is a distribution mechanism for standard code 
sets and vocabularies used in health data systems.  Many institutions apply UMLS resources in a wide 
variety of applications including information retrieval, natural language processing, creation of patient 
and resea rch data, and the development of enterprise -wide vocabulary services for electronic health 
records.  
Data harmonization efforts can similarly boost the impact of individual research by promoting the use of  
common measures across studies within and across particular research fields.  By using common 
measures, researchers can more easily compare and combine datasets to detect more subtle and 
complex associations among variables, thereby promoting greater colla boration, efficiency, and return 
on investment.  For example, in 2006, NHGRI initiated the PhenX Toolkit to  provide standard measures 
related to complex diseases, phenotypic traits and environmental exposures.  Use of PhenX measures 
 90 facilitates combining dat a from a variety of studies, and makes it easy for investigators to expand a 
study design beyond the primary research focus .  
NIH also supports the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse,87 which finds and 
compares tools and resources used for analyzing neuroimages such as MRI scans. Tools include 
software, hardware, and algorithms among others. This resource helps researchers compare and find 
tools best suited to their research projects. De velopers can gain valuable help from the research 
community to make their tools more usable and accessible.  
Large -Scale Informatics Infrastructure  
NIH also has embarked on a number of large -scale initiatives to develop and deploy infrastructure and 
tools f or storing, sharing, integrating, and analyzing the large volumes of data routinely generated in 
research laboratories and in clinical settings.  These initiatives tend to produce not only storehouses for 
data generated by research, but also larger scale ne tworks for sharing data, linking researchers, and 
conducting further research.  NIH supports a number of clinical research networks, for example, which 
allows for standardized data reporting and sharing of information across clinical studies.  
In the area o f cancer research, NIH has established the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid® (caBIG®), a 
collaborative information network for all of NCI’s advanced technology and program initiatives that aims 
to enable collaborative research and personalized, evidence -based care.  The network connects 
scientists, practitioners, and patients, enabling the collection, analysis, and sharing of data and 
knowledge along the entire research pathway from bench to bedside.  Specific biomedical research tools 
under development by caBIG® include clinical trial management systems, tissue repositories and 
pathology tools, imaging tools, and a rich collection of integrative cancer research applications.  
In an effort to support and accelerate research in the prevention, cause, diagnosi s, and treatment of 
research on Autism Spectrum Disorders , NIH created the National Database for Autism Research.  This 
database  collects a wide range of data types, including phenotypic, clinical, and genomic, as well as de -
identified medical images, deriv ed from individuals who participate in Autism Spectrum Disorders 
research, regardless of the source of funding.  The National Database for Autism Research provides the 
infrastructure to store, search across, retrieve, and analyze these varied types of data.  It also 
coordinates data access with many other federal  databases, such as the NIMH Center for Collaborative 
Genetic Studies.  The center is a national resource for researchers who study the genetics of complex 
mental and developmental disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders , and stores human DNA, cell 
cultures, and clinical data.  In 2011, the National Database for Autism Research received an 
HHS innovates  award, recognizing its outstanding innovation efforts within HHS.  
Other efforts aim to provide the  informatics infrastructure to advance basic research and clinical studies 
across the spectrum of biomedical sciences.  The CardioVascular Research Grid provides infrastructure 
for sharing cardiovascular data and data analysis tools. The CardioVascular Rese arch Grid  builds on and 
                                                 
87 For more info rmation, see http://www.nibib.nih.gov/About/Overview/DDSTFactSheet  and 
http://www.nitrc.org/ . 
 91 extends tools developed in the caBIG®, and the Biomedical Informatics Research Network  projects to 
support national and international collaborations in cardiovascular science. The National Centers for 
Biomedical Computing are intend ed to be part of the national infrastructure in Biomedical Informatics 
and Computational Biology. There are eight Centers that cover biophysical modeling, biomedical 
ontologies, information integration, tools for gene -phenotype and disease analysis, system s biology, 
image analysis, and health information modeling and analysis. The centers create innovative software 
programs and other tools that enable the biomedical community to integrate, analyze, model, simulate, 
and share data on human health and disease . 
Biomedical Informatics Research and Training  
Ensuring continued advances in biomedical informatics resources requires active support of 
fundamental research that seeds the further development of new tools, resources, and approaches.  It is 
also critical t o generate a continuous supply of skilled biomedical informatics researchers, information 
specialists (such as medical librarians), and life sciences researchers trained in bioinformatics.  NIH 
continues to expand its efforts in bioinformatics research and training in response to the growing 
importance of informatics in the biomedical and life sciences.  NIH also is the principal source of support 
for research training in biomedical informatics, providing research training grants to 18 institutions that 
enrol l approximately 200 pre - and post -doctoral trainees each year.  
Diagnostic and Point -of-Care Technologies  
Ideally, patients would have access to high -quality and consistent health care regardless of where they 
live. Realizing this vision necessitates the de velopment of portable, reliable, and inexpensive equipment.  
To achieve this also will require the leveraging of technologies developed in other fields, such as 
telecommunications.  Advances in fiber -optic and wireless communications devices allow physicians  to 
engage in telemedicine  (the transmission via the Internet of medical information ) to deliver health care 
by communicating with other physicians or pathologists thousands of miles away.  
NIH currently funds the Point -of-Care Technologies Research Networ k, a network of four centers that 
are developing new point -of-care technologies for early and rapid detection of a wide variety of serious 
conditions such as neurological emergencies, sexually transmitted diseases, multi -pathogen detection 
for national dis aster preparedness, and diagnosis of infections.  These technologies are being designed 
for use in low -resource settings among underserved populations.  The network emphasizes collaboration 
between front -line health care workers and technology developers so that appropriate tools are created 
to meet clinical needs.  
NIDCR supports initiatives that couple discoveries in the pathophysiology of human diseases, with 
innovations in engineering and electronics, to develop point -of-care medical diagnostic devices.  Driving 
this change will be the use of saliva, an easy -to-access diagnostic fluid that may be useful in the 
evaluation of oral and systemic diseases, including the identification of HIV, oral cancer, and 
cardiovascular disease.  As envisioned, a drop of sal iva will be collected and loaded onto a small, all -in-
one device that rapidly measures biomarkers associated with disease allowing early detection , whether 
in a clinic or in remote resource -poor settings.  
 92 Researchers  have  also been able to detect the infla mmatory biomarker C -reactive protein (CRP), a 
strong predictor of the development of cardiovascular disease, in microscopic quantities of saliva.  NIDCR 
is currently supporting aggressive efforts to provide clinical validation of these experimental results that 
could provide a self -contained, portable diagnostic test for cardiovascular disease.  In related work, 
salivary biomarkers are being evaluated to detect myocardial infarction in patients presenting with chest 
pain at emergency departments, providing a tool that may one day enable Emergency Medical 
Technicians to assess if a patient being transported by ambulance is having a heart attack . 
Point -of-care technologies for use in pathology laboratories, emergency rooms, doctors’ offices, and 
homes will be a key component of the evolving health care system.  Current devices, developed largely 
with NIH support, range from handheld glucose monitoring systems used by diabetics to monitor their 
blood sugar levels to laptop -sized ultrasound scanners.  Among the techn ologies on the horizon is a lens -
free optical microscope about the size of a dime.  The device could be inserted into a cell phone and 
used as a diagnostic device in rural settings or developing countries in diagnosing malaria.  
Two ultrasound technologies developed with support from NIH are now being used in clinical practice, 
often outside the hospital or health clinic. The V -Scan is a hand -held ultrasound imaging system the size 
of a cell phone that is now commercially available through General Electric a t a fraction of the cost of 
traditional ultrasound systems. The device produces high quality images of internal organs in real time 
and is being used world -wide. Color -coded images enable physicians to quickly identify problems in 
blood flow or in organs s uch as the heart. The size and portability of the V -Scan allows diagnosis and 
treatment to occur at the point of care, whether that is at a patient’s bedside or in a remote area.  
The second ultrasound technology will be used to treat patients. The High -Intensity Focused Ultrasound 
is a non -invasive tool that uses a concentrated, highly intense ultrasound beam that can be targeted at a 
specific area in the body to remove tissue, destroy tumors or repair injured organs or blood vessels. This 
technique has be en approved by the FDA for treatment of uterine fibroids. Studies on other uses such 
treating brain tumors or for drug delivery to specific organs are continuing.   
Another new device has the potential to save eyesight.  Developed in collaboration between re searchers 
at NIH and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), a dynamic light -scattering probe 
detects and quantifies a protein in the eye that is critical to keeping the eye’s lens clear.  Age-related 
cataracts develop because too little o f the protein, alpha crystallin, is present in the eye.  The new probe 
will be used to monitor the effects of cosmic radiation on astronauts’ eyes as well as to study the effects 
of aging on earth -bound eyes.  Early detection of alpha crystallin depletion co uld lead to treatments that 
could delay or eliminate the need for cataract surgery.  
NIH has also partnered with the Department of Biotechnology of the Ministry of Science and Technology 
in India to support the development of low -cost diagnostic and therap eutic medical technologies that 
will be used in underserved communities worldwide.  One such diagnostic tool under development 
through NIH support of a small business is a low -cost, simple, and rapid point -of-care test for 
tuberculosis that will enable rapi d diagnosis and ensure that appropriate treatment can be  given to all 
affected individuals, thereby reducing the public health impact of this contagious disease.  
 93 Although treatment outcomes for primary cancers have improved in the last decade, many deaths occur 
as a result of the cancer spreading.  Body scans can detect distant cancers but often only after the cancer 
has begun its destructive work.  NIH-supported researchers have created a microchip able to detect 
circulating tumor cells (CTC) in whole blood.  This means that from a sample of a patient’s blood the 
microchip identifies specific cancer cells that are spreading through the body via the circulatory system.  
Clinicians can then make treatment decisions for specific patients based on the molecular and  genomic 
information provided by the CTC analysis.  
NIH also supported two critical phases of the development of a novel “lab -on-a-chip” device for rapidly 
detecting HIV.  The technique has proved highly successful, and the research team has gone on to refin e 
and clinically test this microfluid -based lab -on-a-chip —or mCHIP —in real life settings, with studies 
demonstrating that the mCHIP can accurately, rapidly, and cost -effectively detect clinically relevant 
infectious diseases in resource -limited settings.88 
Another example of “micro” technology improving health care is the portable micro -NMR (nuclear 
magnetic resonance) device.89 This device, operated by a smart -phone , is capable of diagnosing tumors 
from a small sample of cells with greater a ccuracy than traditional biops y. The n eed for a small sample 
allows the tissue to be obtain ed using a very thin needle , resulting in reduced pain and recovery time for 
patients.  
Gene Sequencing and Beyond  
The sequencing of the human genome in 2003 generated excitement  in the scientific community.  It gave 
researchers a new way to analyze the function of cells, tissues, and systems in the body to understand 
the causes of disease.  As more is learned about the genetic contributions to disease, DNA sequence 
information will  become an important tool for individuals and healthcare providers to evaluate 
individualized disease risk and to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease.  However, 
to deliver genetic information to individuals on a much wider basis, sig nificant decreases must be made 
in the cost and time needed to sequence an entire human genome.  Rapid gains have been made on this 
front since the start of the Human Genome Project , and costs continue to fall dramatically.  NIH supports 
technology developme nt to make genome sequencing more affordable and genomic information a 
routine part of health care.  For example, NIH -supported researchers are conducting studies to discover 
the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases like addiction, which is stro ngly influenced by 
genetics.  Investigators studying various neurological and psychiatric illnesses already have linked certain 
genes with specific diseases using custom screening tools known as "gene chips."  Applying these tools to 
addiction and other brai n disorders advances understanding of not only vulnerability to addiction and its 
co-morbidities, but also of ways to target treatments based on an individual’s genetic profile.

 94 Image -Guided Interventions  
To detect disease in its earliest stages, and thereby preempt it before symptoms appear, clinicians will 
need to examine smaller, more localized areas of the body.  Image -guided interventions (IGI) —
treatments or procedures that precisely target areas within  the body with the aid of imaging techniques 
such as MRI, CT, or ultrasound —enable clinicians to look beneath the surface anatomy to visualize 
underlying pathology.  As a result, images can be used to navigate the anatomy for biopsy and treatment 
of disease . In addition to diagnosing at -risk individuals, IGI may offer a safer, less -invasive , and often less 
costly  approach to many surgical procedures.  Compared with traditional open surgery, minimally 
invasive procedures result in less tissue trauma, less scar ring, and faster postoperative recovery time, 
which translates into shorter hospital stays and a more rapid return to family and work.  
NIH’s Center for Interventional Oncology is leading the way in developing and disseminating innovative 
cost-effective al ternatives to open surgery.  Physicians can navigate through the body using "medical 
GPS" —real-time imaging such as magnetic resonance, computed tomography, or ultrasound.  Once at 
the desired location, the physician can insert a needle into a tumor, deliver  heat to destroy it, and then 
deposit a drug to eliminate  residual cancer cells.  The Center is also pioneering new image -guided 
approaches to track personalized responses to new drug therapies over time.  These endeavors are 
contributing to the future of pe rsonalized medicine.  
Imaging Biological Systems  
Better tools and techniques to understand activities within cells, tissues, and organ systems enable 
researchers to probe deeper to gain an understanding of the biological systems and networks that 
control bo th normal function and diseased states.  For example, two NIH intramural research groups are 
collaborating to develop a next -generation MRI system to examine the human brain.  The system uses a 
7-tesla magnet to produce highly detailed images that reveal str uctures not visible using conventional 
MRI.  
More detailed information about the body’s internal organs is critical to detecting early stages of 
disease.  Finding new ways of using current MRI systems can advance safer diagnostic methods.  In the 
case of live r disease, biopsies may cause pain, result in missed work, and also carry a risk of bleeding.  
NIH-supported researchers have developed a non -invasive way to assess the liver using MRI and shear 
waves, a special type of sound wave.  With MRI, the researchers  capture snapshots of the shear waves as 
they propagate through liver tissue.  A computer program translates the waves into a map of the liver 
that displays the stiffness of the organ.  Stiffness indicates disease while suppleness indicates healthy 
tissue.  This could provide a safer alternative not only for liver biopsy but also for diagnosis of cancer in 
the breast, prostate, and kidney.  
Harnessing the power of imaging and molecular biology enables us to probe disease mechanisms and 
image the affected pathwa ys. For example, hyperpolarized C -13 compounds injected into prostate 
cancer patients can be observed with magnetic resonance spectroscopy as these compounds are 
 95 metabolized in cancer cells.90 These metabolic changes serve as biomarkers for prostate cancer as 
disease progresses. Decisions on therapeutic management can thus be closely monitored by magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy.  
Recent  advances in imaging technology  also present opportunities to develop qualified  quantitative 
imaging biomarkers . NIBIB is supporting a public -private consortium called the Quantitative Imaging 
Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA) . This  effort aims to improve the value and practicality of quantitative imaging 
biomarkers by reducing variability across devices, patients, and time . QIBA has selected several 
candidate s and has made advances in establishing standards, methods, and processes aimed at 
accelerating translation of these biomarkers from bench to bedside by engaging researchers, healthcare 
professionals and industry.  
Inve stments in Infrastructure  
Advances in the development of new technology cannot come without supporting the infrastructure 
that undergirds the research endeavor.  To that end, NIH supports a Shared Instrumentation Grant and 
High -End Instrumentation Program, which provides new generation technologies to groups of NIH -
supported extramural investigators for a broad array of basic, translational, and clinical research.  These 
programs provide essential instruments that are too expensive to be obtained through regu lar research 
grants.  NIH also continuously seeks to improve the current "state -of-the-art" in different technology 
areas.  This is highlighted by the NIH -supported Biomedical Technology Research Centers that develop 
innovative technologies to aid researchers who are studying virtually every human disease.  
Large -Scale Co llaborative Activities  
NIH create s critical, often unique technology and methods and appli es them to a broad range of basic, 
translational, and clinical research  through the Biomedical Technology Research Centers (BTRCs) . 
Supported by NIGMS and NIBIB, ther e are currently 65 BTRCs nationwide.  The technologies developed 
in the centers involve  over 7 ,000 investigators  that are  funded by 22  ICs in FY  2010.  BTRCs and 
Biotechnology Resource Centers supported by NIH serve a unique purpose in the broad context of N IH-
funded research.  They represent a critical mass of technological and intellectual resources with a strong 
focus on service and training for outside investigators.  They develop new technologies and tools in areas 
including tissue engineering, biomaterial s, neural communication technologies, imaging, informatics, 
synchrotrons, electron microscopy, proteomics and glycomics, optics, lasers, and BioMEMS 
(microelectromechanical systems —technology just above nano -size—that manipulate, analyze, and 
measure biolo gical or chemical materials).  Access to these technologies is critical to enabling research, 
yet they are frequently too advanced or expensive to be widely available.  These centers disseminate and 
promote the application of such cutting -edge technologies.  These technologies are developed across the 
full spectrum from bench to bedside.  These centers are multidisciplinary and collaborative and serve as 
catalysts for integrating the diverse efforts of NIH -supported researchers, and providing technological 
infrastructure, experimental and computational resources, and expertise.  
                                                 
90 For more information, see http://www.radiology.ucsf.edu/research/labs/hyperpolarized -mri-tech .  
 96 NIH’s Biomedical Informatics Research Network is a virtual community of shared informatics resources.  
The network ’s grid computing technology makes digital research data freely available for sharing and 
exchange among communities of researchers; its data integration tools allow searching across 
distributed databases; and it provides tools for data analysis, management, and collaborative research.  
The resulting collaborative environment ext ends beyond the boundaries of individual laboratories to 
enable collaborations that cross geographic and disciplinary boundaries.  Basic and clinical investigators 
are able to share disparate data as well as powerful new analytical tools and software across  animal 
models and among multiple sites.  This major initiative was developed to allow neuroimagers to share 
data and tools, but the infrastructure is generic and therefore applicable to other disciplines.  
Another technology -intensive collaborative endeavor  has developed due to the rapid expansion of the 
dietary supplement marketplace.  This expansion has resulted in a proliferation of ingredients and 
products . Precise, accurate, and rigorous  analytical methods and reference materials are essential for 
verifi cation of ingredient identity and measuring the amounts of declared ingredients in raw materials 
and finished products.  Also, dietary supplement labels are required to list certain facts about product 
identity and content and to be truthful and not mislead ing. That this is not always the case is due, in 
part, to the lack of proven and agreed -upon methods to precisely assess the quantity of constituents of 
many supplements and supplement ingredients.  NIH’s congressionally mandated Analytical Methods 
and Refe rence Materials program is intended to assist in providing these critical tools for quality 
assurance.  NIH is partnering with FDA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to 
promote the development, validation, and dissemination of ana lytical methods and reference materials 
for commonly used dietary supplement ingredients.  
Bringing a Multitude of Scientific Disciplines Together  
NIH fosters and cultivates cooperative research between health scientists and quantitative scientists so 
that fundamental discoveries and tools can be developed, even when their specific applications might 
not be obvious.  For example, the laser , which was originally developed in physics laboratories studying 
energy and light , has been adapted for microscopes that are critical to many research areas as well as a 
variety of surgical tools, including systems for laser eye surgery.   
Partnerships among engineers, clinicians, scientists, and industrial technologists provide a reservoir of 
information for NIH investigator s. One such partnership is creating innovative technologies to assist war 
veterans who have suffered limb damage or los s as well as civilian amputees and those with spinal cord 
injuries.  A range of electronic and robotic devices will help these individuals  stand  and move.  A new 
generation of hand and arm prostheses that provide fine finger movement , and a sense of touch  is 
especially promising . 
NIH and NASA have a strong history of collaboration and share many interests in the life and health 
sciences. In 2010, NIH  awarded the first new grants under the Biomedical Research on the International 
Space Station (BioMed -ISS) initiative, a collaborative effort between NIH and NASA. Using a special 
microgravity environment that Earth -based laboratories cannot repli cate, researchers will explore 
 97 fundamental questions about important health issues, such as how bones and the immune system get 
weak.  
The interplay of ideas among teams of NIH -supported investigators  has produced promising techniques 
to identify mothers at  risk for premature delivery.  One group used a noninvasive ultrasound approach to 
assess uterine cervical changes in an animal model weeks before the due date.  Another group has 
developed novel computational tools to analyze uterine biomagnetic signals of term and preterm 
patients to predict the onset of labor.  With an early warning of potential preterm delivery, clinicians 
may have new tools to fight one of the leading causes of infant death in the U.S.  
Nanotechnology  
A sheet of paper is about 100,000 nano meters thick.  The field of nanotechnology deals with matter 
approximately 1 to 100 nanometers in dimension.  At these scales, matter exhibits unusual biological, 
chemical, and physical properties.  By bringing together researchers from physics, material scie nce, and 
engineering, NIH is developing a powerful cadre of investigators who will use nanotechnology to 
significantly change how we diagnose and treat disease.  One such group has used electrical forces 
generated at the molecular level to suspend a microsc opic object in mid -air. This finding could 
contribute to the design of tiny machines to perform surgery. Nanotechnology is also informing new 
ways of delivering medicine. For example, N IDA-funded researchers have used nan otechnology to 
successfully demonst rate a prototype programmable skin patch that will let physicians dynamically 
schedule transdermal medication doses to match a patient’s fluctuating needs.  
Sharing information across disciplines is critical to nanotechnology research.  NIH’s Alliance for 
Nanotechnology in Cancer brings together researchers from biology to oncology.  The alliance is building 
a community of cancer nanotechnologists who develop novel approaches to preventing, diagnosing, and 
treating cancer and sharing that knowledge with the la rger medical community.  New nanodevices that 
quickly and accurately assess proteins and DNA structures implicated in cancer, nanoparticle imaging 
agents to clearly visualize cancer, and implantable nanosensors to monitor cancer progression will 
reshape the  toolkit clinicians use to fight cancer.  
Nanotechnology research is also exploring wa ys to treat disease.  Nanoparticle therapy is a method to 
deliver the correct amount of a drug to a precise location resulting in more of the drug reaching its 
target , fewe r side effects to healthy tissue and less toxicity to other parts of the body.91 Natural 
nanoparticles are also being cultivated from plan t viruses as an alternative to manmade nanoparticles 
for imaging, drug delivery, vaccination, and design of electronic devices.  Plant -based particles have  
advantages over synthetic materials in that they are biodegradable and harmless to humans, have a 
defined structure so that dyes and targeting tags can be modified and production is inexpensive.92,93

 98 Probing Proteins  
Information resulting from the Human Genome Project is now helping scientists as they begin to study 
more closely the structure of proteins.  By visualizing protein structures, researchers gain a better 
understanding of many of the biochemical processes related to health and disease.  This information also 
can be used to design drugs that target specific parts of a bacteria, virus, or tumor.  
Struc tural biology is a field in which scientists learn about molecules by determining their 3 -D structures 
in atom -by-atom detail.  Large user facilities called synchrotrons allow researchers to use X -rays to 
determine molecular structures more easily, quickly,  and cheaply than ever before.  NIH funded the 
development of a new experimental station at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National 
Laboratory.  The new station includes three X -ray beamlines for use by scientists from across the U.S. to 
determine the  detailed, three -dimensional structures of molecules, which will lead to improved 
understanding of basic biological processes and for drug design.  
Transforming Health Care  
Brain -Computer Interface (BCI)  devices are m edical devices that operate by exchangin g information with 
nearby portions of brain tissue, which could be placed on the surface of the scalp, near the surface of 
brain, or penetrate into just the top 2mm layer of tissue.  All of these approaches are under 
consideration as candidate designs for a  brain computer interface that could be used to provide a means 
of “speaking” through a computer.  Current development efforts are focused on using the brain signals 
to support communication through basic, brain -controlled movements.  One experimental device  has 
allowed patients to “imagine” movement of fingers to control computer cursor movement across a 
virtual keyboard and type out messages .94 Even at this early stage of development, a similar approach 
might be used to help someone that has been “locked -in” and unable to speak or move limbs as a result 
of a brainstem stroke, a medical condition that was described in the book, “The Diving Bell an d the 
Butterfly” by Jean -Dominique Bauby.  
BCIs are one example of medical implants called neural prosthesis, which are designed to ameliorate the 
loss of nervous system function resulting from disease or injury.  NIH pioneered the development of this 
techn ology through more than 35 years of research and development with the goal of helping people 
with disabilities lead fuller and more productive lives.  The program has catalyzed the development of 
cochlear implants for people with hearing impairments, experi mental control of artificial limbs for 
people with spinal cord injuries, retinal implants that help people regain sight,  and deep brain 
stimulation for Parkinson’s disease, among other contributions.  Through the years, this program has 
fostered the develop ment of a robust research community, which now includes private sector 
companies.  The cochlear implant has received the most widespread use, with more than 220,000 users

Cancer   
The Burdens of Cancer and the Necessity and Promise of NIH Research   
Although significant progress has been made in reducing the burden of cancer in America, cancer 
remains a leading cause of death.  According to the CDC, in 2010, cancer maintained its long -standing 
place as the second leading cause of death in the U.S., surpassed only by heart disease.  In that same 
year, 573,855 people died of  some form of cancer95 and an estimated 1,529,560 individuals were newly 
diagnosed with cancer .96 Also in 2010, according to studies by the NCI Surveillance Research Program ,97 
medical  costs associated with cancer totaled $124.6 billion  and are projected to reach at least $158 
billion by 2020 (in 2010 dollars) .98 Although U.S. death rates for the most common cancers and for all 
cancers combined have decreased significantly since 1995, the annual number of cancer diagnoses is  
projected to rise to 2.6 million because of the growth and aging of the population.  
Cancer research funded and conducted by NIH is critical to the national, as well as global, effort to 
ameliorate and reduce the adverse effects of cancer  on the health and  lives of cancer patients, their 
families, and communities , and on the social and economic well -being of institutions, societies, and 
entire nations.  Formidable challenges confront that effort.  Cancer itself is not a single disease but is, 
rather, a comple x of more than 100 diseases in which genetic changes disrupt cell function . Moreover, 
within each type of cancer an individual’s tumor can differ greatly due to complex biological factors.  
Cancer arises from alterations in the interactions among layered bi ological systems.  The many different 
forms of cancer can be understood only by characterizing these systems and how they interact.  NIH 
cancer research programs aim to improve our understanding of cancer as a multiscale, multidimensional 
disease system.  This approach provides a context for research on: 1) identifying substances in our 
environment that we know or suspect will cause cancer; 2) preventing cancer through use of risk 
assessment s based on genetic susceptibilities and environmental exposures;  3) detecting and diagnosing 
cancer based on knowledge of cancer signaling pathways and biomarkers; 4) predicting cancer 
progression and outcomes based on examination of the tumor microenvironment and interactions 
between tumor cells and surrounding, noncancerou s cells;  5) developing targeted  interventions for

response to treatment; and 6) addressing the unique needs of the growing number of cancer survivors.  
Preci sion medicine based on molecular characterization of individual cancers is t he vision that provides 
the foundation for  NIH’s approach to cancer research and treatment . With the progressive realization of 
this vision, clinicians will have the ability to use  detailed information about an individual’s cancer and 
employ molecular and clinical data to guide the selection of therapies that are most likely to be safe and 
effective for that person.  Precision  medicine promises to improve quality of life for cancer s urvivors  by 
minimiz ing adverse side effects of therapy and reduc ing disparities among populations currently 
experiencing an excess burden of cancer.  
The Organization of Cancer Research at NIH  
Although cancer research is conducted and supported by multiple ICs at NIH, NCI spearheads the 
Agency’s efforts and programs along the continuum from basic to clinical to translational research.  Five 
NCI extramural divisions support research at 650 U.S. universities, hospitals, cancer centers, specialized 
networks and research consortia, and other sites as well as research  in more than 20 other countries.  
NCI’s two intramural divisions —the Center for Cancer Research99 and the Division of Cancer 
Epidemiology and Genetics100—conduct basic, translational, clinical, and popula tion research, aimed at  
fundamental discoveries related to cancer causes and mechanisms, genetics, and host immunological 
and other responses to cancer and aim to rapidly tra nslate those findings into new  preventive and 
detection methods and therapies.  In addition, NCI  also provides infrastructure to help the cancer 
research community , both in the U.S. and abroad,  take advantage of the potential benefits of emerging 
technologies (e.g., genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, and molecular imaging) .  
Cancer re search conducted or supported by other NIH ICs is wide -ranging and often coordinated with 
NCI programs and grantees.  Examples of cancer research within other ICs include:

 103 NIH Funding for Cancer Research  
NIH funding for cancer  research was $5,823  million in FY 20 10 and $5,488  million  in FY 2011 for non -
ARRA (regular appropriations) and $803 million in FY 2010 for ARRA appropriations.102 
Summary of NIH  Activities  
Across NIH, cancer and cancer -related research activities are focused on two overarching goals: 1) 
prevent  cancer at every opportunity and 2) ensure the best outcomes for those diagnosed with cancer . 
Specific objectives related to these goals i nclude : understanding the causes and mechanisms  of cancer; 
accelerating progress in cancer prevention ; improvin g early detection and diagnosis; developing 
effective and efficient treatments ; and building infrastructure for cancer research.  
Cancer results f rom the complex interplay of genetic background and environment al factors.  In some 
cases, a mutation of a single gene may be enough to increase cancer risk while in other cases, 
combinations of gene variants collectively contribute to an individual’s susce ptibility to disease.  A 
myriad of factors can influence cancer risk.  In addition to carcinogens , such as those found in tobacco , 
and some infectious agents, physiological changes related to obesity or other factors can also play a role 
in initiating molecu lar aberrations in a cell’s genome.  
Research that improves our understanding of these causes and mechanisms of cancer , from identifying 
novel risk factors to elucidating the processes of metastasis (the spread of cancer from the primary 
tumor site) , is ess ential for the development and application of interventions to pre vent  cancer’s 
initiation and progression.  NIH’s plan for deciphering the causes and mechanisms of cancer includes 
fundamental research into cell signaling that can provide important insights  into the molecular 
regulators of cell growth and differentiation in a range of tissues.  In addition, NIH supports studies in 
molecular epidemiology to define complex risk factors, research on the tumor macroenvironment and 
microenvironment, understanding the role of altered gene expression in cancer progression, and 
exploring the roles of susceptibility genes in cancer risk and initiation.  
A primary challenge is dissecting the molecular basis of cancer.  The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ,103 
launched in 2006 as a collaboration between NCI’s Center for Cancer Genomics and NHGRI, is the 
largest, most comprehensive analysis of the molecular basis of cancer ever undertaken.  The aim of TCGA 
is to identify and catalog all of the relevant genetic alterations in many typ es of cancer.  The genomic 
information generated by TCGA could fuel rapid advances in cancer research and has already led to  new 
therapeutic targets.  It has suggest ed new ways to categorize tumors, which might allow clinical trials to 
focus on those patient s who are most likely to respond to specific treatments.  In addition, TCGA could 
also yield information critical to reducing health disparities associated with cancer . In conjunction with 
the NCI Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities ,104 TCGA is working  to ensure that adequate 
numbers of biospecimens are obtained from underserved and underrepresented populations  to be

 104 included in TCGA analyses.  Additionally, publicly available TCGA data are being analyzed by multiple 
research groups nationwide and includ e promising efforts to link medical imaging characteristics to 
genomic data to permit non -invasive characterization linked to the cancer genome . 
A prime example of TCGA’s potential is illustrated by research targeting glioblastoma multiforme, an 
aggressive  form of brain cancer.  In the past year, glioblastoma multiforme investigators discovered that 
about 10 percent of patients with one of the four subtypes of glioblastoma multiforme  are younger at 
diagnosis and live longer than patients with other subtypes of the disease, but their tumors are 
unresponsive to current intensive therapies.  The molecular profile of this subtype offers new targets for 
developing drugs to treat this form of the disease more effectively . Research focused on ovarian cancer 
offers an other illustrative example of the promise of fundamental insight offered by TCGA . Analysis of 
nearly 500 ovarian cancers through TCGA revealed several tumor subtypes, identified molecular 
pathways potentially important in tumor maintenance, revealed that m utations in the TP53  gene are 
found in virtually all of these cancers, and catalogued the large areas of the genome whose copy 
number is increased and decreased.  The information gleaned from these as well as other rich sources of 
genomic data will inform a  new generation of drug discovery and treatment options for addressing 
ovarian cancer and some 20 other cancer types currently under study at TCGA.  The TCGA network has 
selected more than 6,000 gene and microRNA (miRNA) targets for sequencing that represen t both 
protein -coding genes and  gene encoding  miRNAs.  
Many other noteworthy NIH research initiatives are underway to illuminate the mechanisms of cancer.  
The Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET)105 initiative seeks to  
identif y and validate therapeutic targets for childhood cancers , such as acute  lymphoblastic leukemia , 
acute myeloid leukemia, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, and Wilms’ Tumor . TARGET investigators have 
identified mutations in a class of protein kinase genes called the Janus  kinases that predict relapse in 
high -risk children with acute  lymphoblastic leukemia . Protein kinase  is an enzyme that modifies and 
functionally changes othe r proteins. TARGET utilizes high -throughput screening technology to identify 
the genetic abnormalities in these pediatric cancers, as does another initiative, the Cancer Genome 
Characterization Initiative .106 Investigators in the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Ana lysis Consortium107 are 
analyzing the sequences and quantities of proteins in samples collected through TCGA with the goal of 
comprehensive proteogenomic integration . Proteomics is biological research that combines proteomics 
(study of proteins) and genomics  (study of genomes).  Additionally, t he Physical Sciences -Oncology 
Centers108 program supports innovative ideas that blend perspectives and principles of physical sciences 
and engineering with cancer biology and clinical oncology with the goal of enhancing the detection and 
treatment of cancer by increasing understanding of the phy sical and chemical forces that govern the 
emergence and behavior of cancer.

 105 The Cancer Target Discovery and Development network109 is accelerating the transition of molecular 
data to new treatments through gene validation studies as well as high -throughput s creening of small 
molecules and research using mouse models.  A number of other NCI resources also support studies in 
mouse models.  The Mouse Models of Human Cancers Consortium110 promotes the use of genetically 
engineered mice for mechanistic studies as well  as to provide insight into new therapeutic strategies 
before they are tested in clinical trials.  Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred Mice developed with 
NCI funding are being used to ascertain genetic determinants of therapeutic response and adverse  
events.  Collaborative Cross mice  that were developed in partnership with NIEHS, NIDA, and NCRR , are 
also being used for mouse GWAS  to expose the gene, gene -gene, and gene -environment contributions 
to cancer susceptibility that are linked to  lifestyle factors such as obesity, stress, diet, and lack of 
exercise.  
NCI is conducting GWAS to identify genetic variants associated with cancer risk.  The Cancer Genetic 
Markers of Susceptibility111 project, originally designed to identify common inherited  genetic variations 
associated with risk for breast and prostate cancer, has grown into a robust research program involving 
GWAS for a number of cancers ( i.e., pancreas, bladder, lung, kidney, brain, esophagus, stomach, testis, 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and os teogenic sarcoma) . In addition, NCI’s longstanding investment in the 
follow -up of cancer -prone families has led to new efforts to discover rare gene  variants using powerful 
new advances in whole -exome  (the coding regions of the genome that are expressed into proteins)  and 
whole -genome sequencing.  To leverage these resources and  ensure that the dramatic advances in 
genomics are incorporated into rigorous population -based studies, data from these initiat ives are being 
made available to both intramural and extramural research scientists as well  as those in the private 
sector through rapid posting  to databases .112 Ultimately, findings from these studies may yield new 
preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic in terventions for cancer.  
Studies through NCI’s Cohort Consortium ,113 a large -scale, international collaboration that include s over 
four million people , are evaluating the role of genetic susceptibility, environmental exposures (including 
nutrition), and gene -environment interactions for a range of different cancer s. In addition, NCI has 
several ongoing and planned genome -wide association studies to identi fy genetic determinants of 
cancer risk , as well as the contributions of major determinants of health such as obesity and tobacco 
use. NCI has also funded a number of studies through its new Post -Genome Wide Association initiative, 
the goal of which is to t ranslate GWAS findings into clinical and prevention applications by replicating 
findings, more accurately pinpointing genomic regions that cause cancer, unraveling the functions of 
genetic variants, and determining how environmental factors alter genetic r isk.  
Another major NIH initiative anchored to the goal of clarifying the environmental and genetic risk 
factors for cancer is the  NIEHS -led Sister Study ,114 which focuses on  breast cancer.  This study involves a

 106 cohort of 50,000 sisters of women who have been diagnosed with  breast cancer.  These unaffected 
sisters are being followed over time, with periodic health updates.  The women who develop breast 
cancer during the follow -up period will be compared with those who remain healthy to identify factors 
associat ed with increased cancer risk.  
NIH also is supporting a network of Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Programs  (BCER Ps)115 
to study the impact beginning in the prenatal period through adulthood to determine which 
environmental exposures  may predispos e a woman to breast cancer.  Initially established in 2003 
through a collaboration involving NCI and NIEHS, BCERPs undertake multidisciplinary studies of the 
genetic, chemical, physical, and social factors that affect breast development during puberty and b reast 
cancer predisposition.  An epidemiologic study conducted as part of BCER P is prospectively following 
through puberty a multiethnic cohort of 7 - and 8 -year -old girls from the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan.  
Other researchers are studying a public school population of Caucasian  and African American students, 
to determine how diet influences fat tissue and alter the effects of hormones on sexual maturation.  The 
effects of endocrine disruptors  (chemicals that in terfere with the hormone system) , irradiation, and 
psychosocial elements also will be studied.  An important goal is to develop public health messages to 
educate young girls and women who are at high risk of breast cancer about the role of specific 
environm ental stressors in breast cancer and how to reduce exposures to those stressors.  Additionally, 
NIEHS ha d an ARRA contract to develop communication toolkits targeting parents and health care 
providers with key messages based on the BCERP research findings.  
Other research into the causes and mechanisms of cancer has revealed that tumors function like organs, 
comprising many interdependent cell types that contribute to tumor development and progression.  The 
relationship between tumors and their surrounding cel lular environment evolves over time, strongly 
influencing tumor progression, metastatic potential, and responsiveness to treatment.  The Tumor 
Microenvironment Network116 is an NIH program focused on expanding our understanding of the role of 
the microenviron ment in which a tumor originates and the critical role it plays during tumor 
development, progression, metastasis , and in conferring therapeutic resistance . 
Furthermore, interest is growing in the scientific community about the relationship between 
inflamm ation and cancer.  Inflammation is a response to tissue damage, whether resulting from physical 
injury, infection, exposure to toxins, or other types of trauma.  NIH is pursuing research on the linkages 
between carcinogenesis and alterations in the microenvironment induced by inflammation.  Current 
research on inflammation suggests that pro -inflammatory conditions contribute to the development of 
several types of cancer, including lung, stomach, and liver cancers, and may lead to new treatment 
approac hes (for example, research efforts focused on inflammatory and fibrotic diseases of the 
esophagus, stomach, colon, pancreas, and liver —all of which are risk factors for the development of 
cancer in these organs).  The Cancer and Inflammation Program117 consti tutes a major component of

 107 NIH’s inflammation and cancer initiative, which partners expertise in inflammation and immunology 
with cutting -edge cancer etiology and carcinogenesis research.  
Systems biology and systems genetics also are promising new fields o f study that will increase our 
understanding of the causes and mechanisms of cancer.  These disciplines focus on biological and genetic 
networks that can be measured, modeled, and manipulated rather than focusing on the individual 
components.  Because this r esearch requires multidisciplinary teams of experts in biology, medicine, 
engineering, mathematics, and computer science, NIH launched the Integrative Cancer Biology Program 
(ICBP)118 to develop a framework for these activities.  The ICBP has funded twelve  integrative biology 
centers around the U.S. to provide the nucleus for the design and validation of computational and 
mathematical models of cancer.  Networks of genes can be found and their associations with cancer 
tested and quantified, and parallel associa tion studies can be conducted in relevant human populations.  
NIH is expanding its research portfolio related to the basic biology of tumor stem cells (also referred to 
as tumor -initiating cells).  Tumor stem cells may be responsible for the recurrence of ma lignancy in some 
cancers.  These cells often are resistant to standard chemotherapeutic agents but may contain unique 
target molecules that allow their eradication with novel molecular therapeutics.  Progress has been 
made in identifying tumor stem cells in multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia , and breast cancer.  
Basic research is unlocking our understanding of what happens in the cellular microenvironment in and 
around a developing tumor.  One aspect of that research is finding ways to boost the body’s ow n 
immune responses to cancer that offers a new array of cancer treatments.  The molecule CTLA -4, for 
example, inhibits the actions of T cells, part of the body’s self -defense against tumors.  Research on 
antibodies that block CTLA -4’s action and allow the bo dy to ramp up its own T -cell attacks on tumors  led 
to the recent approval of the drug ipilimumab for melanoma, and clinical trials using ipilimumab and 
other anti -CTLA -4 antibodies are underway for some lung and prostate cancers.   
Numerous other NCI projects and initiatives are investigating the roles of infectious agents  and the 
immune system in cancer.  Current evidence indicates that as many as one in five cancers may have an 
infectious cause ; this number  is larger in low and middle -income countries . When infectious causes are 
discovered, the agent can represent a molecular target for intervention or a biomarker for screening 
(e.g., human papillomavirus infection of the cervix, hepatitis B and C viruses infection of the liver).  NCI-
funded investigators are working with  U.S. and foreign scientists to  study the role of immune 
dysfunction in the formation of tumors  , in part through the study of cancer in HIV -infected individuals, 
and also by investigating the contributions of chron ic inflammation to cancer development.  NCI is also 
actively investigating therapies that utilize host immune cells and responses to combat tumor growth 
and metastasis.  For example, the Center for Excellence in Immunology ,119 an intramural research 
program, f osters the discovery, development, and delivery of novel immunologic approaches for the 
prevention and treatment of cancer and cancer -associated viral diseases.  The complex interactions 
between tumors and surrounding cells that influence cancer progression  are being characterized by 
projects funded through ICBP and the Tumor Microenvironment Network . Projects funded through the

 108 recent Advanced In vivo  Imaging to Understand Cancer Systems initiative are focused on integrating 
advanced in vivo  imaging technol ogies with systems biology approaches to understand complex cancer 
phenomena at highest resolution.  
NCI supports research to explore the effects of obesity and energy balance on cancer risk as well as to 
inform the development of improved methods for asses sing energy intake, fat distribution, sedentary 
behavior, and physical activity.  NCI also evaluates mechanisms by which obesity may be related to 
carcinogenesis using high -throughput technologies such as multiplex assays  (an assay that measures 
multiple an alytes in a single cycle) , along with other analytic approaches.  An example of an initiative in 
this area is the Transdisciplinary Research on Energetics and Cancer 120 Program, which was developed to 
foster collaboration among scientists and accelerate progress toward reducing cancer incidence, 
morbidity, and mortality associated with obesity, low levels of physical activity, and poor diet.  
For reasons that are self -evident, the optimal strategy  for individuals, their caregivers, and society at 
large  is to prevent cancer.  To this end, NIH research has multiple aims, including modifying behaviors 
that increase risk, mitigating the influence of genetic and environmental ri sk factors, and interrupting 
cancer process through early medical intervention.  
One role of the trans -HHS National Toxicology Program, led by NIEHS , is to review the cumulative state 
of the science on the potential carcinogenicity of publicly registered su bstances such as chemicals (e.g. 
solvents and industrial salts), food additives and herbal medicines (e.g. saccharin, gingko Biloba), and 
other environmental agents (e.g. asbestos).  Determinations are made as to whether a substance is a 
known human carcino gen or reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen, as well as other potential 
toxicities. The findings of these investigations are published in the publically available document,  Report 
on Carcinogens .121  
Dramatic developments in technology and an enhanced, continually evolving understanding of the 
causes and mechanisms of cancer are proving crucial to the development of prevention strategies.  
Research across multiple disciplines will provide a more complete understanding of the interplay of 
molecular, behavi oral, genetic, and other factors that contribute to cancer susceptibility.  Identifying 
critical molecular pathways in precancerous lesions will provide new drug targets for preempting cancer.  
For example, t he recent characterization of ovarian tumors through TCGA may inform development of a 
much needed screening assay for this disease, which is currently often detected in late stages.  Genomic 
studies may also identify targets for chemoprevention.  The Consortia for Early Phase Prevention Trials122 
involve  six major cancer research centers that lead multiple collaborative networks to assess the cancer 
prevention potential of new agents, with a focus on Phase I and II clinical trials.  In addition to designing 
and conducting trials and recruiting participants , the Consortia work to 1) characterize the effects of 
potential agents on molecular targets, 2) identify biological events associated with cancer development, 
and 3) correlate these effects with clinical endpoints.  Continued emphasis will be placed on ide ntifying

 109 molecular drug targets, developing successful prevention strategies, and bringing these findings into 
clinical practice.  
A major step forward in our efforts to prevent cancer has been the development of vaccines that target 
human papillomavirus ( HPV).  Persistent infection with HPV is recognized as the major cause of cervical 
cancer.  Gardasil®, a FDA -approved vaccine against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18  (the viral types that cause 
approximately 70 percent of cervical cancers and 90 percent of genita l warts ) now is available.  Other 
similar vaccines against HPV types 16 and 18, as well as vaccines that address additional subtypes, are in 
development.  These vaccines have the potential to save thousands of women’s lives annually in the U.S. 
and several h undred thousand more each year worldwide.  All of these vaccines resulted directly from 
epidemiological, basic, and preclinical research discoveries, as well as the development of a prototype 
HPV vaccine, by NIH scientists.  
In an effort to reduce the cancer  incidence, morbidity, and mortality associated with obesity, low 
physical activity, and poor diet, NIH has funded the Transdisciplinary Research on Energetics and Cancer 
Research Centers, which foster collaboration among transdisciplinary teams of scienti sts. The Centers 
are studying factors that lead to obesity and the mechanisms by which obesity increases the risk of 
cancer.  The initiative is connecting with a number of established initiatives in the areas of diet, physical 
activity, and weight and is integrated with the Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research .123 
The knowledge that environment and behavior can play critical rol es in the development of cancer has 
been fundamental to one of the greatest public health success stor ies of the 20th century : the reduction 
in tobacco use and related diseases.  By the mid -1950s, the mysterious and alarming epidemic in lung 
cancer, a disea se that was almost nonexistent in 1900, was linked to smoking behavior.  In the last 
decade, overall cancer death rates have dropped for the first time in a century, driven largely by the 
dramatic reduction in male smoking from 47 percent in the 1960s to le ss than 23 percent today.  About 
40 percent of this drop in overall cancer rates has been credited to the dramatic reduction in male 
smoking and male lung cancer deaths since 1991 (more than 146,000 fewer deaths during 1991 to 2003 
alone).  This success has been due to public -private partnerships , and also is a trans -HHS victory, as 
significant research investments have been made over the last 50 years by NCI, NIEHS, NHLBI, NIDA, 
NIAAA, CDC, and AHRQ.  In addition, untold numbers of cancer -related illnesses an d deaths have been 
prevented through the decrease in exposure of non -smokers to environmental tobacco smoke due to 
recognition of these effects and widespread campaigns to limit or ban smoking in public places. Without 
these investments, 40 million America ns might still be smoking today, hundreds of thousands of them 
and those exposed with them would have died prematurely of a tobacco -related disease, and billions of 
dollars would have been spent on their treatment.   
Multiple NIH Institutes have co -funded seven Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Centers ,124 which 
seek to identify familial, early childhood, and lifetime psychosocial pathways associated with smoking 
initiation, use, cessation, and patterns of dependence.  Research on the genetics of addictio n,

 110 physiological biomarkers, and advanced imaging techniques should allow the development of 
individualized and community approaches to the prevention and treatment of tobacco -related diseases.  
The Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center  model demons trates the feasibility and benefits of 
scientific collaboration across disciplines and public -private partnerships.  With a special focus on 
cessation, the NCI -sponsored State and Community Tobacco Control Policy and Media Research 
initiative will investiga te the effectiveness of state and community tobacco control policy and media 
interventions.  Focus areas include secondhand smoke policies, tax and pricing policies, tobacco industry 
marketing and promotion, mass media countermeasures, and community and soc ial norms. 
The NIH -supported Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP)125 provides a network for greater 
participation in clinical trials on cancer prevention and treatment.  There are 48 CCOPs and 1 6 Minority 
Based -CCOPs126 (CCOPs with 30 percent of their new  patients from minority populations) currently 
funded in 35 states  and Puerto Rico.  The program involves 3,645 physicians participating in 415 
hospitals, working on more than 70 active prevention and control trials.  The groups responsible for 
developing an d implementing cancer prevention and control clinical trials are known as Research Bases; 
13 Cooperative Groups and Cancer Centers have grants to serve as CCOP Research Bases.  
The HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN)127 conducts cancer prevention, early detection, treatment, 
long -term care, and surveillance research, using data systems of 14 HMOs nationwide.  Studies of 
lifestyle change include research into energy balance (integrated effects of diet, physical activity, and 
genetics on growth and body weig ht) as a way to control cancer incidence.  The SEER Program128, which 
has collected data since 1973, regularly samples approximately 26 percent of the U.S. population and 
has obtained information on 5.7 million cancer cases —380,000 cases are added each year.  This 
database provides critical data on cancer trends  and is maintained in collaboration with the CDC’s 
National Center for Health Statistics, the Census Bureau, and the North American Association of Central 
Cancer Registries . 
The National Outreach Network129 is a multidisciplinary program that bridges NCI -supported outreach 
and community education efforts with cancer health disparities research and training programs.  
Working through community health educators, the National Outreach Network disseminates cance r 
information and approaches tailored to racial/ethnic communities for cancer prevention and control and 
also works to enhance recruitment and retention in cancer research.  
Detecting and diagnosing tumors early in the disease process, before the tumor becomes invasive and 
metastatic, can dramatically improve a patient’s odds for successful treatment and survival, and prevent 
a large proportion of cancer deaths.  Therefore, NIH seeks to accelerate the translation of basic research 
findings into sophistica ted, minimally invasive procedures that harness imaging, genomic, proteomic, 
nanotechnology, and other advanced early -detection and diagnostic techniques.

 111 Molecular profiling is an ongoing effort at NIH, from work at the bench to larger initiatives.  In the  area of 
molecular diagnostics, NIH has formed the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN)130 to bring a 
collaborative approach to the discovery, development, and validation of early -detection biomarkers for 
clinical application.  Another NIH program, Strateg ic Partnering to Evaluate Cancer Signatures,131 focuses 
on confirming, evaluating, and refining “signatures” derived from the molecular analysis of tumors (i.e., 
biomarkers detection) to improve patient management and outcomes.  In addition, the Cancer Genome  
Anatomy Project132 focuses on determining the gene expression profiles of normal, precancerous, and 
cancerous cells to improve detection, diagnosis, and treatment.  The Cancer Genome Anatomy Project 
Web site makes tools for genomic analysis available to rese archers worldwide.  
Yet another area of research that holds promise for advancing molecular diagnostics is proteomics —the 
study of complex arrays of proteins produced by cells and tissues.  Since its completion nearly a decade 
ago, the Human Genome Project h as catalyzed progress in proteomics research, and NIH has taken a 
leading role in facilitating the translation of proteomics from laboratory research to clinical application 
through the Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer initiative.  The overall obj ective of this initiative is 
to build the foundation of technologies (assessment, optimization, and development), data, reagents 
and reference materials, computational analysis tools, and infrastructure needed to systematically 
advance our understanding of  protein biology in cancer and accelerate basic science research and the 
development of clinical applications.  The Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer comprises three 
integrated programs: the Clinical Proteomic Technology Assessment for Cancer netwo rk, the Advanced 
Platforms and Computational Sciences program, and the Proteomic Reagents and Resources Core.  
Screening for cancers within the large population of people who do not have obvious cancer symptoms 
represents a major undertaking for health care  providers in the U.S.  Most medical organizations , 
including the United States Prevention Services Task Force,  recommend screening for breast, colon, and 
cervical cancers based on demonstrated mortality reductions in randomized trials (breast and colon 
cancers) and large population cohort studies (cervical cancer). There is evidence that the process of 
finding these cancers among the many screened is not optimal.  Whereas performance characteristics of 
individual screening tests (sensitivity, specificity, po sitive predictive value) are relatively well  known, 
analogous performance characteristics of the entire process remain understudied.  To pursue the long -
term objective of optim izing the screening processes  in community practice, NIH is supporting 
Population -based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens Research Centers .133 
This multi -site, coordinated, transdisciplinary initiative has the scientific goal of supporting research to 
better understand how to improve the screening proc ess (recruitment, screening, diagnosis, referral for 
treatment) for breast, colon, and cervical cancer.   
As previously noted, efforts at NIH , and at NCI and NIDA in particular , to study and reduce the use of 
tobacco products have contributed to a sustained  annual reduction in age -adjusted cancer mortality 
rates over the past decade and more, not just among men , where we have seen steady declines , but

 112 now also among women.  Current and former heavy smokers still remain at high risk of developing lethal 
lung c ancers, which are the leading cause of cancer mortality.  The recently concluded National Lung 
Screening Trial134 provided the first clear demonstration that a screening procedure among this high risk 
population can be effective in reducing mortality from lun g cancer.  Current and former  heavy smokers 
who were screened with low -dose helical computed tomography were 20 percent less likely to die of 
lung cancer than were peers who received standard chest x -rays. This promising  finding  combined with 
proven tobacco prevention and cessation efforts  could save many lives among those at greatest risk.  
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has commissioned modeling studies of lung cancer screening by  
investigators in NCI’s Cancer In tervent ion and Surveillance Modeling Network to fully assess the risks 
and benefits of screening with low -dose helical computed tomography. In the coming years, NCI seeks 
to support a wide range of prevention and detection efforts that could have equally signific ant 
outcomes, including enhanced screening for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancers; new imaging 
approaches for more accurate and earlier detection of glioblastoma multiforme, breast, and renal cell 
carcinoma; and identification of biomarkers as early warning signs of the presence of or likelihood of 
developing many kinds of cancers.  NCI research will continue to develop an enhanced understanding 
and ability to modify behaviors that increase the risk of developing cancer, reduce exposure to 
environmenta l carcinogens, and mitigate the effects of environmental or genetic cancer risks.  
Developing more effective, more efficient, and less toxic cancer treatments is at the heart of the NIH 
cancer research agenda.  A better  understanding of the fundamental mecha nisms leading to cancer 
development, progression, and metastasis is improving the identification of key biochemical pathways in 
the disease process as targets for treatment.  Acceleration of target validation and the development of 
new treatment modalities are being made possible by recent advances in biomedical science and 
technology.  A rapid translation from development to delivery will ensure that promising treatments 
move safely and efficiently from preclinical investigation through late -stage clinical t rials and into clinical 
practice.  
NIH is working on multiple fronts in the drive to develop new, more effective therapies for cancer.  One 
innovative initiative, the NCI Experimental Therapeutics Program (NExT) ,135 combines the extensive 
expertise of cancer treatment and diagnosis in anticancer drug development with the dynamic NIH 
intramural research resources.  Drug discovery and development projects that enter the NExT pipeline 
are focused on unmet needs in cancer  therapeutics that are not adequately addressed by the private 
sector . NExT is designed to advance clinical practice and bring improved therapies to cancer patients.  
The discovery engine of this program is the Chemical Biology Consortium .136 The NCI has esta blished this 
collaborative network comprising 12 of the top Specialized and Comprehensive Screening and Chemistry 
Centers with world -class capabilities covering high -throughput  methods, bioinformatics, medicinal 
chemistry, and structural biology.  Additiona lly, the highly successful Developmental Therapeutic 
Program provides the resources needed to facilitate discovery and late -stage preclinical development 
through the final steps of development to first -in-human studies. Concurrent molecular imaging and/or

 113 pharmacodynamic assay development provided by the Cancer Imaging Program ,137 National Clinical 
Target Validation Laboratory ,138 and CCR  allow early assessment of potential clinical biomarkers. These 
coordinated and focused R&D processes enable continued incorp oration of new data and disease 
insights into every step of the discovery and development process, thereby increasing the potential for 
successful clinical evaluation of agents.  The new Clinical Assay Development Program139 has been 
established to accelerate  the movement of promising clinical laboratory assays from the research setting 
into clinical trials.  The program  provides access to tissue and laboratory resources for the analytical and 
clinical validation of assays to predict response to cancer treatmen t or disease outcome.  Services are 
provided to efficiently develop diagnostic tests that address clinical needs, including co -development of 
targeted agents and predictive markers.  In support of the NExT initiative, the Center for Advanced 
Preclinical Research140 will accelerate development of therapeutics and diagnostics for human diseases 
by providing state -of-the-art animal models for preclinical studies that are genetically programmed to 
develop diseases in the same way they arise in humans.  
Another program, the Cancer and Inflammation Program ,141 supports cancer -related basic, translational, 
and clinical research in imaging sciences.  Program  initiatives include the development and delivery of 
image -dependent interventions for malignant and premalignant  conditions; standardized models for the 
design of clinical trials that use imaging technologies; development of emerging imaging technologies, 
including nanotechnology, proteomics, and high -throughput screening; and development of imaging 
methods for canc er detection and treatment and for monitoring responses to therapy.  
NCI investments in basic research lead to identification of potential therapeutic targets, many of which 
are validated and pursued by commercial interests.  With the NExT initiative and oth er similar programs, 
NCI seeks to complement rather than compete with the private sector and often takes the lead on high -
risk projects or those focused on rare cancers.  Drugs against targets that have been characterized in part 
by NCI -funded researchers a re already being used to treat cancer and/or are being tested in clinical 
trials.  For example, Phase III clinical trials have been recently initiated to test therapies targeting  the 
genes  BRAF  in melanoma and ALK in lung cancer.  NCI supports a large portfo lio of translational and 
preclinical studies that are focused on identifying, validating, and testing strategies for the treatment of 
cancer.  The Comparative Oncology Program142 provides an integrated mechanism through which the 
study of naturally occurring cancers in animals can generate new information about cancer and help 
translate biological concepts into clinical application.  As part of this effort, and to evaluate novel 
therapeutic strategies for cancer, the Comparative Oncology Program  has established  a multicenter 
collaborative network of extramural comparative oncology programs to design and implement 
preclinical trials involving domesticated animals.

 114 Using genomics to match drugs to the patients most likely to benefit from them, and conversely spari ng 
patients courses of treatment from which they will not benefit, promises to be among the new 
modalities for successfully managing cancer.  The potential therapeutic impact of basic discoveries made 
by TCGA and other efforts in cancer genomics has been dr amatically illustrated within the past year by 
the development of effective drugs against metastatic melanoma.  In 2003, studies of cancer genomes 
uncovered a common mutation in  BRAF, a gene that encodes a protein known as B -raf. Early stage 
clinical trials  at NCI -designated Cancer Centers of drugs targeted against the mutant BRAF enzyme 
showed that most melanomas with the relevant mutation regressed dramatically .143 Although tumor 
regression generally lasted less than a year, NCI -supported investigators have already pinpointed the 
cause of resistance to BRAF inhibitors, outlining a pathway to more sustained control of this lethal 
disease .144 A Phase III clinical trial is currently underway targeting ALK mutations in lung cancer .145 Such 
targeted treatments, made possible by deeper understanding of the genetic and molecular workings of 
cancer cells, can only be pursued with robust and sustained support both for fundamental research and 
for faster integration of research into clinical applications to improve patient outcomes.  
The emerging scientific landscape of precision medicine made possible by genomic information about 
cancer offers the promise of significant advances for current and future cancer patients.  This effort is 
complemen ted at NCI by a new initiative to engage investigators with novel ideas.  A funding opportunity 
announcement ( Request for Applications)  was released in the fall of 2011 soliciting research applications 
to address NCI’s 24 Provocative Questions146—important but non -obvious questions that will stimulate 
NCI’s research communities to use laboratory, clinical, and population sciences in especially effective 
and imaginative ways.  The potentially game -changing answers to these scientific questions could 
influence the directions taken by NCI-sponsored research in the future, and could contribute to an even 
greater wave of discovery and progress against cancer.  
The Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT)147 is an online  portal that integrates 
genomic d ata from several hundred brain tumors with clinical information about how patients 
responded to treatments, allowing researchers to dissect relationships between genomic traits and 
outcomes as well as conduct in silico  investigations of potential therapeut ic targets.  The Trial Assigning 
Individualized Options for Treatment, or TAILORx ,148 is examining the possibility that a molecular 
profiling test that examines many genes simultaneously can help predict whether women with early -
stage breast cancer would bene fit from chemotherapy in addition to radiation and hormonal therapy.  
Incorporation of molecular data into clinical decision making could spare some women unnecessary 
treatment if chemotherapy is not likely to impart substantial benefit.  The new Provocative  Questions 
initiative may facilitate identification of molecular targets and markers for testing in future clinical trials 
by promoting research to identify the genetic and epigenetic changes that are most critical to the

 115 maintenance of oncogenesis as well  as the properties of nonmalignant lesions that predict the likelihood 
of progression to invasive or metastatic disease.  
In order to facilitate the translation of molecular therapeutic approaches to clinical use in the context of 
radiotherapy, the Radiatio n Research Program149 tests NCI -developed drugs for their efficacy as 
radiosensitizers under a variety of in vitro  environmental conditions and carries out in vivo  radiation 
response studies.  The program  also fills an essential role by coordinating the transfer of NCI -developed 
drugs to extramural and foreign investigators interested in radiation studies, while avoiding duplication 
of effort between research groups.  Efforts are underway to rescue chemotherapeutic drugs abandoned 
due to systemic toxicity and to formulate efficient platforms for gene specific short -interfering RNA 
(siRNA) delivery using nanotechnology -based constructs.  
Innovative research in genetics , imaging, and cancer molecular signatures is laying the groundwork for 
customized cancer pa tient care.  The Advanced Technology Program150 accelerates the delivery of new 
treatments to patients by developing and applying advanced technologies —such as biomedical imaging.  
The NCI imaging facility for clinical cancer research will fuse imaging and pat hology in the evaluation of 
patients throughout treatment.  The NIH Center for Interventional Oncology151 offers new and expanded 
opportunities to investigate cancer therapies using imaging technology to diagnose and treat localized 
cancers in a targeted and minimally or noninvasive manner.  This interdisciplinary environment combines 
training, patient treatment, and translational research and development in interventional oncology.  
Researchers funded through the Quantitative Imaging Network152 are developing and  validating 
quantitative imaging methods and software tools for the measurement of response to drug or radiation 
therapy for use in clinical trials.  
Clinical trials are a critical step in moving potential therapies into clinical practice.  NCI supports clinical 
trials through a number of mechanisms, including  the Cooperative Group Program , which is designed to 
promote and support clinical trials of new cancer treatments, explore methods of cancer prevention and 
early detection, and study quality -of-life and rehabilitation issues .153 The Cooperative Groups are now 
being reorganized to streamline the development and execution of trials, to select and prioritize trials 
through stringent peer review, and to fully fund the most promising and inno vative studies.  In an effort 
to maximize molecular characterization of cancers, biological specimens  from trial participants  will be 
collected for future research.  Other trials are conducted within the intramural research program and 
with extramural suppor t of investigator -initiated projects.  NCI has also implemented the Biomarker, 
Imaging, and Quality of Life Studies Funding Program ,154 which supports promising correlative studies 
related to biomarkers, imaging, and patient quality of life, in association wi th Phase III and large Phase II 
trials.  In order to facilitate management and coordination of the clinical trials portfolio, NCI is creating

 116 the Clinical Trials Reporting Program ,155 a comprehensive database that will contain regularly updated 
information on all interventional trials.  
NCI also encourages both intramural and extramural collaborations as part of its effort to develop new 
treatments for cancer.  One example involves the d rug rapamycin, which specifically and potently acts 
upon an essential signaling pathway in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the most common of 
the head and neck cancers.  As part of an international initiative headed by NIDCR, scientists collected 
hundreds of head and neck cancer tissues from all over the world.156 Examinations of the collected 
tissues confirmed that  the mammalian target of rapamycin  is a good target for treating head and neck 
cancer . Such findings led scientists to develop  novel mouse models to test t he impact of rapamycin 
administration  on head and neck cancer , which was remarkable.  Rapamycin caused the regression of 
established cancer lesions and prevented the development of new ones from pre -malignant lesions. 
New eviden ce in animal models  suggests that rapamycin may also halt the spread of head and neck 
cancer  to other parts of the body.  In collaboration with NCI, NIDCR investigators have begun a clinical 
trial to evaluate the possible survival benefits of treating head and neck cancer patients with rapamycin 
before surgical removal of their tumors.  These studies may lead to improvement in the overall five-year 
survival rate for head and neck cancer, which has remained constant at 50 percent for more than three 
decades.  Melding basic science breakthroughs with decades of existing clinical data on rapamycin 
administration, this clinical trial could clear the way for more targeted and effective treatment of head 
and neck cancer patients.  
Research on the quality of cancer car e is essential to ensur e the best outcomes for all who may be 
affected by cancer.  Research in this area includes surveillance as well as epidemiological and cost -
effectiveness studies.  In addition, quality -of-life research increases our understanding of th e impact of 
cancer on patients, survivors, and their family members —many of whom are themselves at increased 
risk for cancer due to shared cancer -causing genes, lifestyles, or environmental exposures.  
Dissemination of research helps ensure that the knowled ge gained through NIH -supported research is 
appropriately and effectively communicated to health care providers, policymakers, and the public.  
The Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network157 is a consortium of NCI -sponsored 
investigators that seeks  to improve our understanding of the impact of cancer control interventions 
(e.g., prevention, screening, and treatment) on population trends in incidence and mortality  using 
statistical modeling . The network  is focused on meeting the expanding scient ific need for tools which 
assist in synthesizing emerging evidence in a timely manner due to the extraordinary pace of 
developments in cancer control technologies, basic science studies investigating molecular and 
biological determinants of cancer risk, up coming results from clinical trials, and new health -related data.  
NIH focuses on  cancer treatment as a primary area for  quality -of-care research and the translation of 
research findings into practice.  To this end, several collaborative projects have been i nitiated:

 117  The Quality of Cancer Care Committee158 is an interagency working committee  that has fostered 
collaborative projects directly involving HRSA, AHRQ, CMS, Department of Veterans Affairs, IHS, 
CDC, and other Federal health care research and delivery agencies;  
 The National Quality Forum, a major public -private partnership that identifies  core measures of 
cancer care quality;  
 Research on outcomes measurement by the Cancer Outcomes Measurement Working Group159 
and the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium ;160  
 Studies on improving the quality of cancer communications; and  
 Research to monitor patterns of treatment dissemination and quality of care through Patterns 
of Care/Quality of Care Studies .161 In addition, the NCI Community Cancer Centers Program162 is 
researching how best to bring effective cancer treatments to patients i n the communities where 
they live.  
Thanks in large part to the success of new treatment strategies, th e population of cancer patients 
surviving more than five years  from diagnosis  continues to grow.  NIH support s research and education 
efforts aimed at professionals who care for  cancer patients and survivors.  The Office of Cancer 
Survivorship163 addresses the physical, psychosocial, and economic impacts of cancer diagnosis and its 
treatment and the need for interventions to promote positive outcom es in survivors and their families.  
Important early findings suggest long latencies for treatment -related effects  and highlight the need for 
extended follow up, early identification, and intervention before complications become more serious.  
To improve the  outcomes of cancer patients, advances in knowledge must be effectively disseminated 
to the public and health care providers.  The Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T.164 internet -based portal is a 
collaborative effort aimed at providing access to data and resources t hat can help cancer control 
planners, health educators, program staff, and researchers to design, implement, and evaluate 
evidence -based cancer control programs.  P.L.A.N.E.T. assists local programs with resources that help 
them determine cancer risk and bu rden within their state and helps states identify potential partners.  
P.L.A.N.E.T. also provides online resources for interpreting research findings and recommendations and 
accessing products and guidelines for planning and evaluation.  
Due in part to an ex plosion of information through a ny number of communication channels , including  
health information in the news media where cancer consistently ranks first among disease -specific news 
coverage , the public may at times hear conflicting or confusing informatio n regarding cancer prevention

 118 recommendations and other health information . Health communication is a rapidly evolving field . To 
monitor changes and trends in health and cancer communication , NCI developed the Health Information 
National Trends Survey ,165 which  is a national survey uniquely dedicated to learning how people find, 
use, and understand health information. Survey researchers examine  how different communication 
channels  are used by adults 18 years and older , including the Internet, to obtain vita l health information 
for themselves and their loved ones. Program planners us e the data to address  barriers to effective 
health information usage across populations, and create more effective communication strategies.  
Finally, social scientists us e the dat a to study  health communication in the information age in order to 
recommend  strategies  for reducing the burden of ca ncer throughout the population.  
NCI has made significant progress in  expand ing access to clinical trials for patients in community settings  
and for minority and underserved populations.  Representing 340 hospitals and 2,900 physicians, t he 
CCOPs enroll one -third of all participants in NCI cancer prevention, control and treatment trials 
nationwide.  The current 16 Minority -Based CCOPs , comprising 55 hospitals and 475 physicians, and 
including 100 minority investigators,  enroll patients into approved trials in areas with at least 30 percent 
underserved or minority populations.  Minority -Based CCOPs have an average of 64 percent minority 
participants on trials at their sites.  The NCI Community Cancer Center Programs  was expanded from the 
original 16 pilot sites to a total of 30 sites with the goal of improving the quality of cancer care for more 
than 50,000 new cancer patients from rural, inner -city, and underserved communities each year and 
providing them the opportunity to participate in cancer research.  
NCI also invests in research to elucidate the factors that contribute to cancer health disparities.  The 
Basic Research in Cancer Health Disparities initiative supports research to understand the biological 
mechanisms for cancer disparities among various racial and ethnic populations.  The program 
investigates genetic/biological differences and cellular mechanisms that may lead to cancer dis parities 
among various populations.  The Centers for Population Health and Health Disparities166 program 
supports transdisciplinary research involving social, behavioral, biological, and genetic studies to 
elucidate the causes of health disparities and devise  effective methods of preventing, diagnosing, and 
treating disease and promoting health.  Using a regional approach, t he Geographical Management of 
Cancer Health Disparities Program167 is working to support biospecimen collection, development of 
bioinformatic s platforms, clinical trials recruitment and retention, emerging technologies applications, 
and the development of research projects that focus on health disparities in racial/ethnic minority and 
underserved communities.  As part of a broader Center to Redu ce Cancer Health Disparities Biospecimen 
Awareness/Education and Collection Campaign, the Geographical Management of Cancer Health 
Disparities Program  is also working to raise awareness about the importance of biospecimens and to 
educate minority populatio ns about biospecimen research.  Working in collaboration with TCGA, this 
national campaign aims to increase the collection of high -quality breast and prostate cancer specimens 
from racial/ethnic minority and underserved populations, as well as raise awarene ss and education 
about biospecimen research.

 119 The incidence of cancer in low and middle income countries is projected to increase in the coming years . 
It is estimated that approximately 70  percent  of cancer deaths will occur in low and middle income 
countries . High prevalence of cancer risk factors such as smoking, unhealthy diet, and infections are 
attributable to this increase , as are improvements in infectious disease management, health care 
delivery, and sanitation, which ha ve augmented population  longevity . The NCI Center for Global 
Health168 was launched in 2011 to support NCI’s goal to advance cancer research, build expertise, and 
leverage resources across nations.  The Center  focus es on reduc ing the global burden of cancer  by 
supporting research programs and activities in cancer prevention, screening and early detection, 
diagnosis, treatment, palliation, and survivorship.  The Center builds capacity for cancer research in the 
United States and other countries through training  and education as well as research cooperation with 
other countries.  The Center has offices in other countries, including India, China, and Belgium , and has 
established research networks in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Ireland.  
The infrastructure requ ired for initiating and sustaining a robust, multi -front effort to advance the 
science and treatment of cancer is exceptionally complex and varied in terms of its components.  One 
such component is technology; NIH places a high priority on technology develo pment to support both 
research and the application of research findings to improve health care delivery, emphasizing the areas 
of bioinformatics, cancer imaging, proteomics, and nanotechnology.  As NIH -supported scientists begin 
to apply new discoveries to cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment, it will be important to 
integrate the tools and insights of research, science, and technology as effectively as possible.  
The Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid® (caBIG®)169 is an important initiative design ed to accelerate 
research discoveries and improve patient outcomes by supporting the sharing of data and tools among 
researchers, physicians, and patients throughout the cancer community.  caBIG® has developed and 
freely distributed more than 40 software to ols with applications in basic and clinical research on cancer 
and other diseases.  NIH is committed to extending caBIG® across the broader cancer research and care 
community.  More than 1,500 individuals, representing more than 450 organizations in 13 count ries, 
have so far participated in caBIG® projects.  caBIG® technologies have been used to link the 6 6 Cancer 
Centers, NCI Community Cancer Centers Program , TCGA, other NIH Institutes, FDA, and international 
partners.  
The new BIG Health Consortium™ is a public -private partnership among key stakeholders in health care  
including  patient advocates, health care providers, payers, product innovators, investors, and 
information technologists.  Its mission is to show how and why personalized medicine works.  Throu gh a 
series of demonstration projects, BIG Health™ will model a new approach in which clinical care, clinical 
research, and scientific discovery are linked.  The key enabler for this linkage is the informatics 
infrastructure that NIH has already developed —caBIG®.  
The Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer, a comprehensive endeavor involving both public and private 
sectors, is designed to accelerate the application of nanotechnology to cancer research.  This initiative 
supports research on novel nanodevices to detect and pinpoint the location of cancer at its earliest

 120 stages, deliver anticancer drugs specifically to malignant cells, and determine in real time whether these 
drugs are effective in killing those cells.  Programs of the Alliance include the Nanotechn ology 
Characterization Laboratory; Cancer Nanotechnology Platform Partnerships; Centers of Cancer 
Nanotechnology Excellence; Innovative Technologies for Molecular Analysis of Cancer; and Tumor Stem 
Cells in Cancer Biology, Prevention, and Therapy.  
Given th e global burden of cancer and opportunities to identify new approaches in prevention and 
treatment through international collaborative research, NIH is strengthening health research 
infrastructure and building global research capacity through the Internati onal Tobacco and Health 
Research and Capacity Building Program.  This program promotes transdisciplinary approaches to reduce 
the global burden of tobacco -related illness and is designed to promote international cooperation 
between U.S. investigators and sc ientists in low - and middle -income nations where tobacco 
consumption is a current or anticipated public health problem . Because the overwhelming majority of 
smokers begin tobacco use before they reach adulthood, the program emphasizes research on 
determina nts of youth smoking in diverse cultural and economic settings, as well as effective ways to 
prevent young people from starting to smoke.  
A cornerstone of the infrastructure for NIH -sponsored cancer research is the NCI’s Cancer Centers 
Program, which focus es on transdisciplinary approaches to basic, population, and clinical research.  
Centers with comprehensive designation must have robust portfolios in each of these areas and must 
also demonstrate professional public education and outreach activities in the  communities they serve.  
Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE) grants, each of which focuses on a specific organ 
site, such as breast or lung cancer, or a group of highly related cancers, such as gastrointestinal cancers, 
involve both basic a nd clinical/applied scientists (team science) and support projects that will result in 
new approaches to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat human cancers.   
The 66 NCI-designated Cancer Centers conduct some of the highest quality basic, translational, and  
population research to improve cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment while also stimulating 
innovative pilot projects in new investigational areas.   
NCI-designated cancer centers are increasingly reaching out to community oncology practices and 
mino rity and underserved patient populations.  They are also committed to delivering high -quality care.  
A program has been established to pre -qualify and re -qualify annually all of the comprehensive cancer 
centers to perform advanced imaging so that both quality of the imaging and shortened time to clinical 
trial initiation can be assured.  
The SPOREs foster bi -directional translational research by supporting multi -project, interdisciplinary, and 
in some cases, multi -institutional research that will result in diverse new approaches to the prevention, 
early detection, diagnosis and treatment of human cancers.  SPOREs create an environment for inter -
SPORE collaboration and collaboration with other government and non -governmental groups to 
increase cross -fertili zation of ideas, leverage resources, to reduce duplication and to ensure access of 
resources to scientific community ultimately facilitating the movement of SPORE research along the 
translational science continuum.  SPOREs encourage involvement of patient a dvocate s and support 
 121 preclinical and early -stage clinical studies focused on molecular pathways associated with organ -site 
specific cancers, with emphasis on therapeutic targets.  New treatments are developed concomitantly 
with predictive markers that ident ify patients most likely to respond to specific treatments.  Promising 
therapies are advanced to NCI Cooperative Groups or industrial partners for evaluation in later stage 
clinical trials.  SPOREs also support novel projects focused on the identification of  cellular and molecular 
markers to improve early cancer detection, diagnosis, and risk assessment to reduce cancer incidence, 
morbidity and mortality, to extend survival, and to increase the quality of life of cancer patients.   
Research workforce development is critical to maintaining and enhancing the nationwide (as well as 
global) infrastructure for cancer research.  NCI, in particular, is committed to cultivating and supporting a 
cadre of researchers that span the career continuum; gaps at any st age of this continuum will 
compromise the quality of cancer research.  NCI is i nvest ing in early -stage investigators to attract talent 
and ensure the future of cancer research  and is also support ing established investigators who have 
proven their ability to  conduct robust science and who provide mentoring for the next generation of 
researchers.  NCI supports training within the intramural research program and through training awards 
to institutions and individuals in the extramural community.  NIH will continue to invest in attracting the 
best and brightest graduate students and postdoctoral fellows —including those from populations 
underrepresented in biomedical research —for example, through the Ruth L. Kirschstein National 
Research Service Award (NRSA) training program.  NCI-awarded NRSAs support the training and 
mentoring of predoctoral and M.D./Ph.D. or other dual -degree students in laboratory and/or clinical 
research, helping them to become productive, independent research investigators and clinician -
scientists.   
NCI also supports training in a number of other disciplines.  The Physical Science -Oncology Centers  
program trains undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral trainees with the aim of cultivating a 
workforce capable of working at the interface of the physical sciences and cancer biology.  Additionally, 
the Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) offers educational activities and 
short -term career development experience to encourage new and established investigators to engage  in 
basic behavioral and social science research.  The Interagency Oncology Taskforce , a partnership with 
FDA, is designed to train scientists in cancer -related scientific research and research -related regulatory 
review, policies, and regulations.  Finally, NCI also offers support to investigator s interested in 
translational and clinical research.  The SPORE Career Development Programs support investigators who 
wish to develop or refocus their careers on translational cancer research in specific organ -site 
malignancies.  The Cancer Clinical Investigator Team Leadership awards provide two years of funding to 
exceptional mid -level clinical investigators who lead NCI -sponsored clinical trials but are not principal 
investigators at NCI -designated Cancer Centers.  
Conclusion —Realizing the Vision of Precision Medicine  
Through both extramural and intramural initiative, NIH is progressively realizing its vision of precision 
medicine and care for all those who are affected by cancer. With sustained, robust public suppor t, NIH 
will continue to make critical advances in the effort to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated 
with the second leading cause of death among American adults.   
 122 Neuroscience   
Composed of the brain, spinal cord, sensory organs, and nerves of the  body, the nervous system 
underlies perception, movement, emotions, learning, and memory, and other functions essential to 
individual and societal well -being.  The nervous system interacts with all other organ systems and is 
affected by countless diseases, conditions, and environmental factors.  Moreover, with limited capacity 
for self -repair, the nervous system is particularly vulnerable to damage due to injury or infection, and its 
repair mechanisms are poorly understood. Neuroscience research seeks to unde rstand the nervous 
system and its functions in health and disease.  Given its intrinsic complexity and central role in 
physiology and behavior, this understanding must necessarily come from multiple perspectives.  
Accordingly, neuroscience research spans man y disciplines, from genetics to physiology to psychology, 
and applies tools from areas such as molecular biology, anatomy, computer science, and imaging 
technologies.  
Neuroscience is a unifying theme in NIH research.  The intramural and extramural programs of several 
ICs have a major focus on the nervous system, but the full scope of NIH neuroscience activities extends 
to components of research portfolios across most of the Agency, reflecting the multidisciplinary nature 
of the field and the importance of th e nervous system to many aspects of human health, development, 
and disease.  These activities often involve collaborative efforts combining the unique strengths and 
expertise of individual ICs . To reinforce such collaborations, NIH established the Blueprint  for 
Neuroscience Research , which  accelerates neuroscience research through training programs, the 
development of shared tools and resources, and initiatives to address challenges in neuroscience that 
transcend the mission of any single IC.  
The principal a im of NIH research in neuroscience is to reduce the burden of diseases that affect the 
nervous system, including a broad range of neurological disorders; disorders affecting cognitive, 
emotional, and behavioral function; diseases and conditions that impair  the primary senses; and 
developmental and age -related disorders.  Whether led by single investigators or conducted through 
centers and consortia, NIH neuroscience research includes basic science studies of normal function and 
development in both humans and  animal models, translational research that develops medications or 
other therapies, and clinical trials that test interventions in patients.  
Nervous system disorders include common killers and major causes of disability like stroke, multiple 
sclerosis, an d epilepsy, as well as hundreds of less common diseases, such as lysosomal storage 
disorders, spinal muscular atrophy, muscular dystrophies, inherited neuropathies, neurofibromatosis, 
tuberous sclerosis, and Rett and Tourette syndromes.  Many neurological d isorders have genetic or 
developmental origins.  Others result from trauma to the nerves, spinal cord, or brain ; from 
autoimmune, infectious, or systemic disease; from tumor growth in nervous system tissues; or from 
neurodegenerative processes as in Parkins on’s disease, glaucoma, frontotemporal dementia, and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  Still others are known or suspected of resulting from environmental 
exposure to substances, such as pesticides, solvents, PCBs, and metals.  NIH research on neurologic al 
diseases, largely supported by NINDS, seeks to uncover their causes and mechanisms and to develop 
 123 drugs and other treatments or preventive strategies.  This research also aims to understand the multiple 
aspects of the nervous system that disease can affe ct and has shared support across NIH for basic 
science studies of the cerebral vasculature, electrochemical signaling in neurons and other cells, 
mechanisms of development and cell death, neuromuscular function and motor control, and behavior 
and cognition . In addition, NIH works to enhance the lives of those disabled by stroke, traumatic brain 
injury, spinal cord injury, and other neurological conditions through research supported by NICHD’s 
National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research and other ICs  on neuroplasticity, recovery and 
repair of motor and cognitive function, and rehabilitative and assistive strategies and devices.  
Brain disorders affecting cognitive, emotional, and behavioral function include schizophrenia and 
psychoses; autism spectrum  disorder and other developmental disorders; mood and anxiety disorders; 
addiction to nicotine, alcohol, and other substances; and post -traumatic stress disorder, eating 
disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD) , and others.  Through resear ch efforts led by 
NIAAA, NIDA, NIMH, NIEHS, and other ICs, NIH focuses on understanding the causes of these conditions 
(e.g., the underlying neural and behavioral bases) and their effects (e.g., the acute and long -term effects 
of abused substances on the n ervous system) so as to develop effective  therapies and interventions for 
treatment and prevention.  
Communication disorders make it challenging for a person to sense, interpret, and respond to 
environment al stimuli . Not only do communication disorders comp romise a person’s physical health, 
but they also affect that person’s emotional, social, recreational, educational, and vocational life.  One 
such disorder, a phasia , results from damage to portions of the brain that are responsible for language. 
This disorder usually occurs suddenly, often as the result of a stroke or head injury, but it may also 
develop slowly, as in the case of a brain tumor, a n infection, or dementia. NIDCD, NINDS, NICHD,  NIMH, 
and NIA support research on this disorder.  The goal of this research is to develop therapies to improve 
an individual's ability to communicate by helping the person use remaining abilities, to restore language 
abilities as much as possible, to compensate for language problems, and to learn other methods of 
com municating.  
Sight, smell, hearing and balance, and our other primary senses, require specialized nerve cells that 
respond to specific features of the external or internal environment and send signals to the brain.  For 
example, l ight coming through the lens  of the eye projects onto photoreceptor neurons in the retina. 
Absorption of light causes the protein structure within these cells  to twist, triggering a cascade of 
molecular and electrical changes in the photoreceptor cell , which then send signals to the brain  for 
further processing.  NEI funds research on basic visual neuroscience in the eye and brain, and on diseases 
and conditions that affect vision. NIDCD conducts and supports biomedical and behavioral research, a s 
well as  research training  in the normal and disordered processes of hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, 
speech, and language related to answering fundamental scientific questions and to prevent, screen, 
diagnos e, and treat disorders of human communication.  
Although vital to survi val, the sensation of pain also is symptomatic of many diseases with origins in and 
outside the nervous system, such as migraine and other headaches and cancer -related pain.  NIH pain 
research is led by NI NDS  and the NIH Pain Consortium, which coordinates r esearch across NIH in this 
 124 area with the guidance of an Executive Committee comprised of the NINDS, NIDCR, NINR, NCCAM, and 
NIDA Directors .  
NIH-supported research also studies the many ways the nervous system interacts with and regulates 
changes in the bo dy’s internal environment.  This research, including efforts supported by NHLBI and 
NIDDK, focuses on areas such as circadian rhythms and sleep disorders; neuroendocrine processes that 
regulate stress responses, hormone levels, and motivational states; and the neural basis of appetite and 
feeding, which is of key relevance to slowing the increasing rates of obesity worldwide.  
Nervous system disorders may arise during early development,  strike young adults, or emerge late in 
life. NICHD , NIEHS,  and other ICs sponsor research on the development of the nervous system and its 
functions.  This research encompasses studies of structural birth defects, including spina bifida and other 
neural tube defects, and associated conditions such as hydrocephalus , cerebral pals y, Down syndrome, 
and other causes of intellectual and learning disabilities.  Nervous system development continues into 
early adulthood in humans, and developmental processes and external influences contribute to mental 
fitness and disease risk later in li fe, including the risk for addiction, which often begins in childhood or 
adolescence.  At the other end of the lifespan, with key support from NIA, NIH research on the aging 
nervous system includes studies of age -related disorders such as Alzheimer’s diseas e (AD) and other 
dementias, as well as environmental and lifestyle factors affecting neurological, cognitive, and 
emotional health in aging populations.  
Across all ages, the nervous system is a common target of exposure to toxins, pollutants, metals, food 
constituents, and other agents, the effects of which range from acute reactions to developmental 
disruption to  neurodegeneration.  NIH-sponsored research on the consequences of such environmental 
exposures for nervous system  development,  function , and disea se is a particular focus of NIEHS.   
NIH also considers diseases of the nervous system from a global point of view.  Coordinated in part  by 
FIC, NIH supports neuroscience -related research around the world in unique populations and 
environments and on factors contributing to disparities in disease vulnerability and treatment quality 
and access, such as socioeconomic conditions and infectiou s disease.  
Nervous system disorders take an enormous toll on human health and the economy.  Even rare disorders 
carry a substantial collective burden, as they often have an early onset and long duration, and the 
stigma commonly attached to neurological and mental disorders  further compounds individual and 
societal impact.  According to 2005 estimates, neurological disorders strike more than 1 billion people 
worldwide, account ing for 12 percent of total deaths .170 In the U.S., stroke is the fourth leading killer  of 
adults and results in annual medical and disability costs totaling more than $34 billion and estimated to 
reach almost $96 billion by 2030 .171 Each year, another 1. 7 million Americans sustain traumatic brain 
injury (TBI), the leading cause of death and l ong-term disability in young adults ,172 with direct and

 125 indirect costs reaching approximately $76.5  billion in 2000 .173 Head injury also accounts for an estimated 
20 percent of combat -related injuries in modern wars, and blasts are a leading cause of TBI in mi litary 
personnel .174 According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, tinnitus (ringing in the ears) is the most 
prevalent service -connected disability of American veterans, with more than 744,000 veterans receiving 
disability compensation for tinnitus as of  the end of FY 2010.  
In a given year, approximately 12.5 million American adults (or one in every 17) suffer a debilitating 
mental illness .175 Mental disorders result in more disability for U.S. adults than any other class of medical 
illness ,176 and a conservative estimate places the total direct and indirect annual costs of mental illness 
at more than $300 billion .177 In 20 11, among persons in the U.S. ages 12 years or older, 16.7  million 
were classified with dependence on or abuse of alcohol, and  6.5 million with dependence on or abuse of 
illicit drugs .178 The overall social and economic burden of substance abuse continues to rise, with annual 
costs related to alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug abuse totaling more than $600 billion .179  
Mental illness  and neurological disorders affect people of all ages.  An estimated 17 percent of U.S. 
children have a developmental or behavioral disorder such as autism spectrum disorder , intellectual 
disability, or ADHD .180 Current demographic trends project a growing burden from age -related diseases 
of the nervous system as populations benefit from increased longevity.  One in seven U.S. adults ages 72 
years and older has dementia, and estimates of the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease range from 2.4 
million to 5.1 mill ion, a number expected to rise to as many as 13.2 million by 2050 unless effective 
interventions are developed.181

NIH funding for research in neuroscience and disorders of the nervous system  was $5,515 million in FY 
2010, and $5, 548 million in FY 20 11 for non -ARRA (regular appropriations) and $794 million in FY2010 
for ARRA appropriations .182  
Summary of NIH Activities  
Neurodevelopment, neuroplasticity, and neurodegeneration are common themes that reflect shared 
biological processes found in many aspects of nervous system function and disease.  In this section, 
these themes will serve to highlight selected examples of activities and progress in neuroscience 
research enabled by NIH, as well as ch allenges and future opportunities.  Additional activities and 
initiatives exemplify how collaborative approaches are facilitating advances in basic, translational, and 
clinical neuroscience.   
Neurodevelopment: Periods of Growth, Maturation, and Vulnerabilit y 
Complex interactions between gene expression and function, endocrine and other physiological 
processes, neuronal activity, and external influences guide the development of the nervous system.  
From the early differentiation of its many neuronal and other cell types to the establishment of billions 
of connections between neurons, each step in nervous system development is vulnerable to disruption 
by disease, injury, or environmental exposures.  NIH research across all stages of neurodevelopment is 
leading to  a better understanding of neurological, mental, and behavioral function in health and disease 
throughout life, as well as to new treatments and preventive strategies.  
During early human embryonic development, a flat surface of cells destined to become the  brain and 
spinal cord rolls into a structure called the neural tube.  Defects resulting from improper neural tube 
formation, including spina bifida and anencephaly, are among the most common birth defects.  A 
randomized clinical trial supported by NICHD recently showed that prenatal fetal surgery to repair the 
spinal opening in the most common form of spina bifida resulted in improved outcomes as compared to 
standard postnatal surgery.183 NICHD and NINDS are supporting a follow up study to determine the 
effects of prenatal repair on adaptive behavior, cognitive and motor function, brain morphology and 
microstructure, urologic health, and other outcomes  at school age . Other NIH-funded studies explore 
the developmental mechanisms of neural tube closure, includ ing structural, genetic, and dietary 
influences in animal models and in humans, which may identify targets for intervention or prevention.  
NINDS  also supports a broad portfolio of research on hydrocephalus, a condition that often develops in 
people with sp ina bifida  and other developmental brain malformations . Shunts to drain excess 
cerebrospinal fluid are the most common treatment for hydrocephalus, but they often fail due to 
blockage or infection . In 2009, NINDS and NICHD issued a funding opportunity announcement  for small 
business research to improve the design, operation, and monitoring of CSF shunts.  The initiative brought

 127 increased small business attentio n to this applied research need, and the awards made so far are 
supporting the development of i mplantable and non -invasive diagnostic and monitoring devices, novel 
materials for preventing shunt infection and blockage, and a new shunt design with feedback control.  
Developmental disability is a severe, long -term disability that can affect cognitive a bility, physical 
functioning, or both.  According to the CDC, there are an estimated 35 –43 million people with physical 
and mental disabilities in the U.S.  The Eunice  Kennedy  Shriver  Intellectual  and Developmental  
Disabilities  Research  Centers  support  proje cts that address  cerebral  connectivity;  genetics  and 
environmental  influences  on brain  development;  efforts  to prevent  and treat  conditions  ranging  from  
brain  injury  in premature  infants  to autism spectrum disorder ; and research  programs  in 
genetic/genomic  disorders,  inborn  errors  of metabolism,  and mitochondrial  disorders.  In addition, NIH is 
supporting the development of new technologies for newborn screening and an infrastructure to 
promote newborn screening research.  The goals are to develop fast, relia ble, and cost -effective means 
to screen newborns and to expand the number of conditions these tests can assess.  Such screening 
makes it possible to begin treatment early, when chances for success are greatest.   
Both genetic and environmental factors influe nce nervous system development and function, and a 
growing area of neuroscience research focuses on how genes and the environment interact to influence 
both disease course and treatment for a range of disorders including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s 
disease, depression and other mood and anxiety disorders, addiction, and autism spectrum disorder . 
NIAAA - and NIDA -supported researchers examined the role that variability in genes that encode a 
specific receptor for the neurotransmitter (neurotransmitters are chemicals involved in transmitting 
signals from one nerve cell to another) dopamine may play in improving outcomes of a  substance use 
prevention intervention in a case control study of African American rural adolescents.  The study , wh ich 
focused on parenting behavior,  found that youth carrying one variation of this gene (DRD4) not only 
were more responsive to the intervention than youth with another variation , but also that they reduced 
past month alcohol or marijuana use over a 29 -mon th period.  Taken together with the previous finding 
that variation in a gene that regulates the actions of the neurotransmitter serotonin influences  initiation 
of adolescent substance use, the results suggest different genes may influence different phases of 
substance use and highlights potential opportunities to match individuals to prevention programs based 
on genotype.  
NIH supports broad efforts to understand how autism spectrum disorder  may arise from combined 
effects of genetic vulnerabilities and exposure to potentially harmful environmental agents during key 
periods of development.  Recent research suggests that environmental factors may play a much greater 
role in autism risk than pre viously suspected and could even be more influential than genetic factors.  
These findings stem from a study in twins184 designed to model the genetic and environmental factors 
that contribute to the development of autism.  Using mathematical modeling, the res earchers propose 
that environmental factors accounted for 55 percent of autism risk, while genetic heritability 
contributed less than 40 percent.  The difference in rates among fraternal twins and siblings, who share

 128 similar amounts of DNA, suggests that en vironmental factors in the womb may be an important area of 
future study.  
Although all forms of autism spectrum disorder  are characterized by challenges in three core domains of 
functioning (social impairments; communication difficulties; and restricted, r epetitive, or stereotyped 
patterns of behavior), considerable heterogeneity exists across individuals with autism spectrum 
disorder  in these and other clinical features, suggesting the contribution of multiple developmental 
trajectories and causal factors.  One cross -cutting theme highlighted in the Interagency Autism 
Coordinating Committee ’s (IACC) Strategic Plan for autism spectrum disorder  research is the need to 
understand this heterogeneity, which could lead to new insights into the causes of autism spectrum 
disorder , improved diagnosis, and more targeted intervention strategies.  To examine the genetic basis 
of autism, researchers sequenced the protein -coding region of the genome (called exome ) of 20 people 
with autism and their parents , and identifie d 21 spontaneous or  de novo mutations.185 Of the 21 
mutations, four were determined to be potentially causative ( FOXP1 , GRIN2B , SCN1A , and LAMC3 ). 
Three of the four genes identified in the study had previously been associated with autism, intellectual 
disability without autism, and epilepsy.  The fourth mutation, LAMC3 , had never before been linked to 
autism and represents a potential new avenue of research.  Furthermore, within the study , two of the 
four children had been hit with a "genetic double -whamm y"—both inheriting a harmful gene mutation 
from their parent s and having a  de novo  mutation.  These two cases support the “multi -hit” theory of 
autism —that a combination of mutations in the same pathway is necessary to cause severe autism or 
related disorders.  The authors note that the study supports the role of  de novo  mutations as a major 
genetic contributor to autism.  
The human brain continues to mature into early adulthood, and understanding normal nervous system 
development is essential to knowin g when, where, and how developmental processes can go wrong.  In 
the NIH Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Study of Normal Brain Development, NIH -supported 
researchers at seven collaborating institutions collected brain scans and clinical and behavioral data  
from more than 500 healthy infants, children, and adolescents over the course of seven years, providing 
important baseline information that could identify signs of atypical brain development.  The data 
gathered and analytical tools developed for this longi tudinal study are available to the broader research 
community in a n online , searchable database.  An improved understanding of the normal course of 
human brain development also is yielding insights into behavioral and cognitive development and 
function acro ss the lifespan.  For example, previous brain imaging studies have shown that one of the 
last brain areas to fully mature is the prefrontal cortex, an area important for decision -making and 
impulse control.  This aspect of brain development may contribute to  impulsive behavior in teenagers 
and help explain their increased susceptibility to substance abuse and addiction.  A number of human 
and animal studies have suggested that the developing brain is vulnerable to heavy alcohol use  in 
adolescence ; however, it is unclear whether the structural and functional deficits that were observed 
predated the onset of alcohol use or occurred as a consequence.  To further elucidate how alcohol 
impacts the developing  adolescent brain in both the short and long term, NIAAA is supporting  multisite 
longitudinal studies of youth ages 12 –21, capturing them before they begin to drink . The studies are

 129 using  advanced neuroimaging technology as well as neuropsychological and behavioral measures to 
assess alcohol’s effects on brain dev elopment and the associated cognitive, affective and behavioral 
processes.   
NIH investigators already are using knowledge about human brain and behavioral development to guide 
research on interventions to treat nervous system disorders , or to reduce their risk of occurrence later 
in life.  For example, researchers reporting delayed development of the prefrontal cortex in ADHD are 
now studying the effects of ADHD treatment on the rate of cortical maturation.  Research has 
established that substance abuse is a developmental disease beginning in childhood and adolescence. 
Therefore, prevention strategies must focus on developmentally appropriate interventions for youth. In 
fact, universal prevention approaches  that teach all children (regardless of risk) problem -solving, refusal, 
and coping skills have proven successful not just in reducing future drug abuse risk  but other related risk 
behaviors, as well . The NIH Underage Drinking Initiative similarly supports research on prevention of 
underage drinking an d its risk factors, as well as efforts to develop and implement effective 
interventions within a developmental framework.   
Neuroplasticity: Substrates for Change and Repair  
Throughout development, and even once its basic structure and circuitry have been e stablished, the 
nervous system retains a remarkable capacity to adapt to changes in the body’s internal environment 
and external conditions and events.  This capacity, known as plasticity, reshapes the function and activity 
of neuronal networks, and it occu rs at many levels of the nervous system.  Plasticity enables beneficial 
adaptations, generally associated with a gain in function, including acquiring new knowledge, improving 
performance, and adjusting behavior.   
One project funded by NEI provides a unique  opportunity to study neuroplasticity and visual 
processing while also providing humanitarian benefit. Project Prakash operates in India, which has 
the largest population of blind children, many of whom live in poor, remote villages with limited 
access to professional eye care. The project screens thousands of children for treatable conditions, 
such as dense congenital cataracts that are routinely removed in the U.S. and has provided vision to 
hundreds. T he treated children are old enough to describe the ob jects they are beginning to see and 
learning to recognize after gaining sight. Using behavioral tests and neuroimaging to study how the 
brain turns visual input into recognizable images, the results ha ve provided remarkable insights. For 
example, contrary to previous theories, Project Prakash is showing that even after years of being 
blind since birth, children can still acquire complex visual abilities, providing hope for restoring 
functional vision to many children.   
However, neuroplasticity also can lead  to maladaptive changes, associated with negative consequences, 
which contribute to a range of conditions, including mood disorders, addiction, chronic pain, and 
cognitive impairment.  Neuroplastic changes also are intrinsically connected to biological even ts like 
neurogenesis, neurodegeneration, neuronal sprouting, and changes in signal transduction pathways, 
which all play a role in several neurological disorders . Maladaptive plasticity can also arise as a 
consequence of long -term drug exposure, as in the case of drugs of abuse and levodopa -induced  
 130 uncontrolled movements ( dyskinesias ) in Parkinsonian patients.  By better understanding the 
underlying mechanisms of neuroplastic changes in the nervous system, researchers may be able to both 
harness their therap eutic potential and limit their deleterious consequences.  
Plasticity -related processes in brain circuits contribute to many of the underlying causes of epilepsy, 
which include developmental malformations, genetic mutations, trauma such as stroke or head in jury, 
brain tumor, and central nervous system infection and inflammation.  In 2010 and 2011, NINDS 
announced several new initiatives that aim to better understand the causes of epilepsy and to develop 
new ways to treat or prevent its development in those at  risk.  
 The Epilepsy Centers without Walls  program  supports multidisciplinary consortia to solve specific 
challenges in the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of epileps y. Although causal genes have been 
identified for a number of rare, familial epilepsy syndromes, the genetic contributors to more 
common forms of epilepsy are not well known, and the first awarded Center aims to identify new 
genes and genetic pathways by analyzing 4000 genomes of epilepsy patients and families collected 
by several major res earch groups.  NINDS is also supporting planning grants in advance of a potential 
Center without Walls focused on Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy and has announced a new 
funding opportunity for planning a Center focused on treatments to prevent epileps y or modify the 
course of disease .186 
 The Cooperative agreement program for epilepsy therapy development  supports translational 
research to develop new ways to treat or prevent epilepsy, with a goal for successful projects to 
result in Investigational New Drug  (IND)  or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) applications to the 
FDA.  NINDS supports a project through this program to develop a seizure prediction and drug 
delivery system that will administer antiepileptic drugs only at times of high seizure like lihood. Such 
intelligent drug delivery may not only prevent seizures, but could also limit adverse cognitive and 
physical side effects associated with chron ic antiepileptic drug exposure .187 
 The Epilepsy EUREKA program  encourages innovative and transformativ e epilepsy research to 
uncover disease mechanisms.  NINDS has made 11 awards through this program, each of which 
employs the latest research methods to provide new insights into understanding and ultimately 
treating epilepsy .188 
Mental and addictive disorders  are known to have a strong neurodevelopmental component and are 
associated with functional changes in highly plastic brain areas, such as the prefrontal cortex, which play 
a key role in cognition and impulse control.  Recent studies suggest that putative s chizophrenia risk 
genes are involved in regulating neuroplasticity, and alterations in their expression and function may 
contribute to the abnormal pattern of cortical connectivity observed in schizophrenia.

 131 NIH will continue to support research on treatments for mood disorders through clinical trial networks 
and the Innovative Approaches to Personalizing the Treatment of Depression Program.  Ongoing studies 
include investigations on susceptibility genes and associations with brain structural changes in major 
depressive disorders; analysis of biomarker predictions of outcome based on quantitative 
electroencephalographic features that change during a week of exposure to antidepressant 
medications; and observational studies using longitudinal data from l arge population -based samples to 
identify patterns of response to multiple treatments.   
Neuroplasticity also underlies a range of changes in brain function and behavior involved in the 
development and persistence of addiction.  For example, a landmark NIDA -funded study in mice 
identified  a biological mechanism that could help explain how tobacco products could act as gateway 
drugs, increasing a person’s future likelihood of abusing cocaine and perhaps other drugs as well . Mice 
that were exposed to nicotine f or a week showed an increased response to cocaine.  This effect 
depended on nicotine -induced changes in the structure of the tightly packaged DNA molecule  that 
reprogram the expression pattern of specific genes, including a gene linked to the switch from ac ute to 
chronic drug effects . If nicotine is found to have similar effects in humans, these findings suggest that 
effective smoking prevention efforts would not only prevent the negative health consequences 
associated with smoking but could also decrease th e risk of progression and addiction to cocaine and 
possibly other illicit drug s.  
Several examples of maladaptive plasticity have been observed in pain disorders.  Opioid analgesics are 
the most powerful medications currently available to treat chronic pain , but they can unfortunately 
result in addiction, tolerance, and physical dependence, limiting their value in some patients.  Scientists 
are working toward the development of a morphine -like drug that will have the analgesic qualities of 
morphine , but witho ut the drug's negative side effects.  Another  focus of NIH -supported research to 
develop new pain treatments is the cannabinoid signaling system.  Just as the brain produces natural 
opioid -like compounds, it also produces natural compounds that act on the same receptors as the 
neuroactive component in the cannabis plant (marijuana).  Cannabinoid signaling modulates neuronal 
activity and plasticity and also plays a role in modulating pain.  Research suggests that selective 
activation of cannabinoid signaling p athways may provide pain relief with minimal mind -altering effects.  
NIH funds research on understanding and identifying the multiple and varied contributions of 
dysfunctional changes in the central nervous system  that lead to and maintain persistent pain.  For 
example, work supported by NIH is exploring the role of  increased activity of neurotransmitters in 
enhancing neuronal activity in response to pain.  NIH- funded research has also demonstrated the role of 
increased activity in certain brain structures in  amplif ying pain signals or causing or maintaining 
persistent pain.  For instance, repeated activation of certain brainstem neurons (neurons in an area of 
the brain that regulates basic functions such as breathing and heart rate) causes an increase in their  
activity associated with a transition from episodic to chronic daily headaches.   
NIH-supported researchers also have reported new findings on the mechanisms that lead to neuropathic 
pain induced by nerve injury.  Following injury, the nervous system underg oes a tremendous 
reorganization.  Thus, therapies directed at preventing these long -term changes may prevent the 
 132 development of chronic pain conditions.  Most available treatments for neuropathic pain target neurons.  
In contrast, the new findings highlight the role of certain enzymes released by non -neuronal cells called 
glia, which are involved in immune and inflammatory responses to nerve injury.  Future treatments 
targeting glia may provide a way to halt the maladaptive signaling cascade that results in ne uropathic 
pain.  NIH also supports efforts to exploit adaptive plasticity at the level of brain networks for 
therapeutic pain intervention.  Using real -time brain imaging, researchers have shown that patients with 
chronic pain can learn to exert voluntary co ntrol over activation of a particular brain region involved in 
pain perception and its regulation, effectively reducing the impact of their painful sensations.  Future 
research will focus on the question of whether neuroimaging profiles  can be used as a bio marker that 
would allow for an objective diagnosis of different pain conditions, and for the prediction of individual 
responses to specific therapies.  
NIH is playing a key role in the new Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee, which includes 
biomedical researchers, representatives from nonprofit public advocacy organizations, and 
representatives of six federal government organizations that deal with pain research and patient care.  
The committee will work to identify critical gaps in basic and cli nical research on the symptoms, causes, 
and treatment of pain, and coordinate pain research activities across the federal government with the 
goals of stimulating pain research collaboration.  
Although plasticity can lead to changes in neural activity patte rns throughout life, the adult human brain 
and spinal cord have a limited capacity to replace or repair neurons that are lost or damaged by injury or 
disease.  An exciting area of neuroscience research focuses on ways to overcome these limitations  and to 
harness neuroplasticity mechanisms  to promote recovery and restore function.  For example, spinal cord 
injury often leads to permanent paralysis and loss of sensation below the site of injury , because 
damaged nerve fibers are unable to regrow across the injur y site.  NIH supports research to understand 
the mechanisms that restrict such regrowth and to design strategies that integrate new nerve fibers into 
spinal circuitry.  In one study, researchers showed that the vitamin folate  (also known as vitamin B9)  
promo tes healing in damaged rat spinal cord tissue by stimulating DNA modifications.  The concern for 
U.S. Representative Gabrielle Gifford s following a brain injury resulting from a gunshot , as well as the 
high rate of TBI among military personnel , has also increased attention on recovery, rehabilitation, and 
brain plasticity.  Recently published data on TBI patients suggest that gene polymorphisms related to 
neuroplasticity may play a role in the variability of recovery.  Ongoing TBI research projects supported by 
NIH are investigating the mechanisms of cognitive, attentional, memory, and motor problems and 
exploring how plasticity contributes to recovery.  Examples include investigations on dietary 
interventions to correct metabolic changes following TB I; the beneficial effects of exercise on plasticity; 
and brain imaging studies addressing how forced -use behavioral therapy affects the brain reorganization 
that underlies motor recovery.  ARRA -funded research grants in this area include testing standards f or 
data collection and outcome research from rehabilitation centers, and assessing a home stroke 
rehabilitation system that includes user -friendly home therapy robots and a tele -rehabilitation system.  A 
National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research -funded project is studying the effects of home -
based care for pediatric TBI patients in Latin America, where the incidence of TBI is three times the 
 133 world average.  The same project is also developing a data registry and improving the research 
infrastructure  for future pediatric TBI research in Latin America.  
Neurodegeneration: Fighting the Effects of Age, Exposure, and Disease  
The progressive loss of neurons is a common endpoint of many diseases and insults to the nervous 
system.  Such degeneration presents c hallenges to developing strategies to slow and prevent cell death, 
protect remaining neurons, and possibly replenish those that are lost.  Aging is the most consistent risk 
factor for many disabling neurodegenerative disorders.  As the number of older people  in the U.S. is 
projected to increase dramatically between 2010 and 2030, it is imperative to discover new and more 
effective ways to improve the health and productivity of this segment of the population.   
NIH research on neurodegenerative diseases focuses  on understanding their biological and 
environmental causes, and on efforts to develop interventions that not only alleviate their symptoms, 
but that may slow or even stop disease progression.  Initially supported through  ARRA funds, the iPS Cell 
Consortium  is developing induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in three  neurodegenerative diseases 
(Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) for use in disease 
mechanism studies and preclinical therapy.  In FY 2011, NINDS announced continued support for the iPS 
cell consortia through a public -private partnership with industry, non -government organizations, and 
the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine.  
Alzheimer’s disease (A D) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, though some inherited 
forms of the disease become symptomatic in middle age.  AD slowly impairs memory, thinking skills and, 
eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks of daily living . NIH-supported basic research on AD 
mechanisms has contributed in recent years to the development of new drug treatments.  Although 
these treatments can help to manage symptoms in some people, they cannot cure this devastating 
disease .  
NIH, with NIA taking the l ead, supports a comprehensive research portfolio on AD, including basic 
research, epidemiological studies and clinical trials, to better diagnose, prevent, and treat AD . Ongoing 
research initiatives include:  
 The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer’s Network (DI AN) is a consortium of scientific investigators 
that recruit, study, and follow individuals from families with early onset dominantly inherited 
AD, a rare form of the disease.  Understanding the sequence of brain changes in early -onset AD 
patients could pro vide insight into the more common late -onset form of the disease.  
 Basic research projects on aging and AD  funded by NIA  and other institutes  apply directly to 
understanding the etiology of AD.  Major research areas include studies on inflammation, 
protein q uality control, and response to stress.  Findings in these domains are likely to shape our 
approaches at combating AD.  For example, NI A-funded investigators have recently  developed a 
mouse model that expresses human tau, one of AD’s pathological hallmarks, and discovered 
that tau pathology is transmitted from cell to cell, beginning in the brain’s entorhinal cortex and 
spreading from one brain region to the next.  This discovery provides insight into AD’s earliest 
 134 development and offers a model for testing me chanisms and functional outcomes associated 
with disease progression . 
 Through an initiative within the  NIH Common Fund  Epigenomics Program, NINDS  and NIA  
funded a large project investigating  the role of DNA functional modifications in the cognitive 
impairment associated with AD.  
 The AD Genetics Initiative  has facilitated the recent identification of new candidate risk factor 
genes through genome wide association studies and other high throughput technologies.  This 
initiative will speed the pace of discovery by providing a centralized resource for investigators to 
access, study, and share data relevant to AD.  
 The AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, Phase II) investigates  changes in brain s tructure and 
function as people transition from normal cognitive aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to 
AD. An innovative public -private partnership, ADNI has stimulated the development of more 
sensitive tools for tracking the development and progression of MCI and AD.  Other ADNI 
projects include a genome -wide association dataset of study participants and a longitudinal 
study of cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from study participants.   
 The AD Translational Initiative  supports studies lead ing to the submission of an IND application 
to the FDA, a prerequisite for beginning human trials of potential new therapies.  
 Human Cell Reprogramming for Aging and AD i s a ground -breaking initiative supporting the 
development of iPS cells to facilitate th e study of the genetic, molecular, and cellular 
mechanisms underlying human aging and AD.  
NIH currently supports over 35 clinical trials investigating a wide range of interventions to prevent, slow, 
or treat AD and/or cognitive decline . Many of these trials are coordinated through the long running AD 
Cooperative Study.  Examples of highly promising studies include a pilot trial on a nasal -spray form of 
insulin to delay memory loss and preserve cognition, a study of brain amyloid deposits i n healthy people 
as a predictor of A D risk, and the ADNI cerebrospinal fluid biomarker study, which may aid the  
develop ment of  a diagnostic test for the early stages of AD.  Finally, a joint effort between  NIA and the 
Alzheimer’s Association has made possib le the first revision of the clinical diagnostic criteria for AD in 27 
years.  The new guidelines address the use of imaging and biomarkers to determine whether changes in 
the brain and body fluids are due to AD.  
Parkinson’s disease (PD) ranks among the mos t common late -life neurodegenerative diseases, with a 
prevalence of 1 percent in individuals over the age of 60.  NIH-supported research has identified 10 new 
genetic mutations as risk factors for PD, revealed the benefits and risks of deep brain stimulatio n in PD 
patients , determined that tai chi improves balance and stability in patients with PD more than resistance 
training or stretching, and developed a novel strategy for deriving dopamine neurons from human 
pluripotent stem cells. Ongoing research effor ts continue to uncover new gene mutations associated 
with increased risk for PD.  NINDS is establishing the PD Biomarkers Program, which will support clinical 
and laboratory -based  research projects, as well as bio -repository and data management resources to 
 135 accelerate biomarker discovery.  NINDS also supports numerous investigator -initiated grants covering a 
variety of research priority areas, including the detection of genetic and environmental risk factors, 
identification of molecular and neurophysiological determinants of PD, and the development of 
technologies and therapeutics to improve symptoms or  halt the progression of the disease.  In addition, 
NINDS and NIEHS support numerou s PD -related resources, research centers and clinical trials.  For 
example:  
 NINDS currently funds 10 Morris K. Udall Centers of Excellence  across the country.  These 
centers , which  were authorized by the Morris K Udall Parkinson’s Disease Research Act of 199 7, 
provide  a collaborative,  interdisciplinary  framework  to accelerate  PD research . 
 The Centers for Neurodegeneration Science (CNS) Program  strengthens  the interchange  among  
geneticists,  clinicians,  epidemiologists  and scientists  engaged  in PD research . Three NIEHS -
funded CNSs (UCLA, Emory University, and the Sanford Burnham Institute) are now exploring 
the interaction of environmental risk factors (e.g., agricultural pesticides) with proteins and 
pathways implicated in genetic forms of PD.  
 The NIH Explor atory Trials in PD (NET -PD) program supports clinical  trials conducted  at more  
than  50 centers  across  the U.S. and Canada  and designed  to evaluate  drugs  that slow  PD 
progression . NET-PD is conducting a Phase III clinical trial of creatine in patients with PD and is 
currently  recruiting patients for a pilot study to test the safety and tolerability of pioglitazone, 
an FDA -approved drug that may prevent neuronal loss in PD.  
 Other clinical tria ls funded by NINDS include a Phase III trial designed to compare the efficacy 
and tolerability of antidepressants in PD patients, and a multicenter Phase II study initiated in 
2011 to determine whether moderate and/or vigorous exercise reduce PD symptoms i n newly 
diagnosed patients.  
Many of the leading causes of blindness are due to neurodegenerative diseases. In retinitis pigmentosa, 
genetic mutations in key proteins cause light -sensitive photoreceptor cells to die. NEI researchers are 
testing gene therapy  to treat some of these diseases, and have published very promising gene 
replacement clinical trial results for a form of Leber’s congenital amaurosis, a retinal degenerative 
disease caused by a mutant enzyme. Stargardt’s disease and age -related macular de generation (AMD) 
are neurodegenerative diseases in which atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a tissue that 
supports and nourishes the photoreceptors, ultimately causes the neurons to die as well. In a clinical 
trial started in 2011, Advanced C ell Technology, Inc. transplanted RPE derived from human embryonic 
stem cells in patients with Stargardt’s and AMD. Although many neurodegenerative diseases may be 
caused by rare mutations, NEI is funding research on more general therapy options using neur otrophins, 
factors that function to protect neurons from degeneration and may be able to rescue neurons at risk of 
loss through neurodegeneration, no matter the cause.   
Moreover, n eurons are not unique in their vulnerability to degenerative diseases.  Muscular dystrophies 
(MD) are a class of neuromuscular disorders that lead to progressive muscle weakness and 
degeneration.  NIH support for research on MD includes funding for six congressionally -mandated Paul 
 136 D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Re search Centers189 (also see the section on Wellstone 
MD Cooperative Research Centers  in Chapter 4), as well as several initiatives for translational research.  
A public -private partnership funded by NIH, Parent Project MD, and PTC Therapeutics has made 
signif icant progress in identifying and optimizing small molecules that alter the levels of target proteins 
involved in the pathophysiology of MD.  Other translational projects with public -private funding include a 
study focused on developing the peptide, biglyca n, as a therapeutic for MD, and the first translational 
cooperative agreement for therapy development in myotonic dystrophy, the most common adult form 
of MD.  The NIH Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) Program has also accepted two 
MD proj ects for therapeutic co -development with biotech partners.   
Other projects supported by NINDS and NIAMS focus on non -invasive imaging methods to track disease 
progression, and on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying those forms of MD that are 
not yet at the stage of therapy development, such as congenital MD.  NIAMS has recently funded a new 
Center of Research Translation of Systemic Exon -Skipping in MD, which will test the therapeutic 
potential of molecules that promote the production of a modi fied, but functional, form of the protein 
dystrophin.  NHLBI also funds a number of basic and translational projects to investigate the basis for 
cardiac muscle disease in MD, and develop and evaluate novel therapies to prevent or restore 
dystrophin express ion. 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common of a number of diseases that lead to the degeneration of 
myelin, a fatty substance that sheathes many nerve fibers in the brain  and the peripheral nervous 
system , causing a variety of symptoms including impai red mobility, spasticity, chronic pain, and 
depression.  Despite tremendous efforts, the cause(s) of MS are still elusive.  NIH-funded research covers 
a wide range of topics including studies on genetic and environmental risk factors; basic research on 
myeli nation, demyelination, and neuron degeneration; the blood -brain -barrier breakdown in MS; the 
immune system function in the central nervous system; optic neuritis (visual impairment due to 
inflammation or demylenation of the optic nerve); mechanisms underly ing gender differences in the 
incidence of MS; and development of better strategies to diagnose MS and monitor disease progression.  
For example, NINDS supports a  randomized, double -blind Phase III trial comparing the efficacy of 
treatment combining two FDA -approved MS medications ( beta -interferon and glatiramer acetate ) 
versus  treatment with either agent alone for relapsing -remitting MS  (CombiRx) . Preliminary results 
showed that the combined treatment decreases the rate of brain lesions but was  no more effective than 
either agent alone for reducing the risk of relapse . An ancillary study of CombiRx aims to  identify gene 
and protein biomarkers  of disease progression and treatment response  in patients with relapsing -
remitting MS.  In addition, othe r Phase  I/II clinical  trials , including  studies  conducted  at the NIH Clinical  
Center,  are investigat ing the safety and efficacy of immunotherapies, mesenchymal stem cells, 
nutritional supplements, and hormonal treatments.

 137 Advancing Neuroscience Research through Collaboration  
Federal neuroscience research involves  collaboration across NIH, HHS, and several other executive 
branch departments, including the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Veterans Affairs  
(VA), and the Department of Education (ED).  For example, NIH ICs have a long history of collaboration  
with DoD and the VA on TBI research, including a long -term study of the neuropsychological outcomes 
associated with TBI among Vietnam War veterans and th e development of the Federal Interagency TBI 
Research informatics repository .  
Since its inception in 2004, the NIH Blueprint  for Neuroscience Research  has been a successful model of 
trans -NIH collaboration, bringing together 16 NIH ICs and Offices that su pport neuroscience research.  
The Blueprint continues to support clinical assessment tools for neurological and behavioral function, 
and widely used neuroimaging, neuroinformatics, and genetics and animal model resources.  The NIH 
Blueprint also supports tra ining programs for neuroscience researchers, including programs focused on 
interdisciplinary research training, computational neuroscience, neuroimaging, and translational 
research.  In addition, the Blueprint has announced new Grand Challenges initiatives focused on 
understanding the connectivity of the human brain, neuropathic pain, and the development of 
treatments for brain disorders.   
 The Human Connectome Project  is an ambitious effort to map the neural pathways that 
underlie human brain function.  The project will lead to major advances in our understanding of 
what makes us uniquely human and will set the stage for future studies of abnormal brain 
circuits in many neurological and psychiatric disorders.  
 The Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network was establ ished to bridge the gap in drug 
development between academic and industry research.  The Network offers neuroscience 
researchers a "virtual pharma" to develop promising  compounds from chemical optimization 
through Phase I clinical testing.   
 The Grand Challe nge on Pain supports research to understand the changes in the nervous 
system that cause the transi tion from acute to chronic pain , which can be an issue in TBI, stroke, 
spinal cord injury, and other conditions.  One goal of the initiative is to enhance col laboration 
between researchers in the pain field and those with expertise in neuroplasticity  
Other  recent  NIH Blueprint  for Neuroscience  Research  initiatives  include:  
 The Non -Human Primate Atlas  of detailed gene expression patterns in the developing rhesus 
macaque brain was created and hosted by the Allen Institute for Brain Sciences.  This 
developmental neuroanatomical framework for exploring the cellular and molecular 
architecture of the develop ing postnatal primate brain has direct relevance for human brain 
development.  The free online resource has a unique set of data and tools that allows viewing of 
indexed image sets searchable by gene, brain area and developmental stage, side by side with a 
high resolution Nissl/MRI atlas reference data set.   
 138  The Blueprint K -12 Science Education  funded eight  science education grants that seek to 
improve and enhance neuroscience  education in grades K -12 as well as inspire future 
generations of neuroscientists.  The grants focus on providing innovative  neuroscience  education 
to children throughout the U.S. through a variety of mechanisms such as the development of 
interactive teaching modules that can be accessed on iOS devices (e.g., the iPad), innovative 
online  games for classroom use, and museum exhibits that include interactive components as 
well as classroom activities.  
 The Neuroscience Information Framework is a government -led project providing a dynamic 
inventory of online  neuroscience  resources —data, mater ials, and tools accessible via any 
computer connected to the Internet.  The Framework  advances neuroscience  research by 
enabling discovery and access to public research data and tools worldwide through an open 
source, networked environment.  
 The Gene Expression Nervous System Atlas is an NIH -funded, publicly available gene expression 
atlas of the developing and adult central nervous system in the mouse . It is also a source of mice 
genetically engineered to produce green fluorescent protein in diff erent cell types within the 
nervous system.  
Other NIH collaborative activities for neuroscience research include  collecting and sharing clinical 
research data , which  requires large investments in time and resources . However , currently there is no 
uniform w ay to help investigators implement NIH data -sharing policies for research on neurological 
disorders.  In 2006, NINDS initiated an effort called Common Data Elements190 to address this issue for 
many different disease areas.  NINDS has worked with disease -specific experts and other stakeholders as 
part of this effort to develop standards to facilitate data collection, analysis and sharing across the 
research community.  To date, this effort has led to the development of a set of core data elements, a nd 
disease -specific elements for headache, spinal cord injury, stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, Friedrich’s ataxia, and multiple sclerosis, all of which 
are available on the website for use by inve stigators.  A working group is currently developing data 
elements for several neuromuscular diseases, such as spinal muscle atrophy, Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy, traumatic brain injury, and myasthenia gravis.  
Using FY 2009 ARRA funds, NIH is constructing t he 293,839 square feet Porter Neuroscience Research 
Center Phase II, which will host cross -disciplinary researchers for seven ICs generating discoveries in 
structural biology, synaptic processing, sensory systems and sensory development, neuroenvironments,  
neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration, behavior, genetics, and high resolution microscopy.  
The Joint NSF/NIH Initiative to Support Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience is a joint 
initiative among seven NSF Directorates and Offices, nine participating NIH ICs, and the German Federal 
Ministry of Education and Research.  The program supports innovative, collaborative science and 
engineering research on brain function, integrating computational models and methods with 
neuroscience , emphasiz ing data sharing.

 139 NIH IC Directors participate in the Institute of Medicine Forum on Ne uroscience  and Nervous System 
Disorders, which focuses on building partnerships to further understand the brain and nervous system, 
disorders in their structure and functio n, as well as effective clinical prevention and treatment 
strategies.  
NIMH has partnered with the U.S. Army and DoD to carry out  the Army Study to Assess Risk and 
Resilience in Service members (Army STARRS),  the largest study of suicide and mental health a mong 
military personnel ever undertaken.  The rate of suicide among Army soldiers has exceeded the civilian 
rate.  This initiative seeks to identify risk and protective factors, including neurobiological factors that will 
help the Army develop effective stra tegies for reducing rising suicide rates.  
NIH, in partnership with DOD, is building a central database for traumatic brain injury (TBI) research 
designed to promote data sharing and accelerate comparative effectiveness research on brain injury 
treatment an d diagnosis. The Federal Interagency TBI Research database  will serve as a central 
repository for new data, link to existing databases, and allow valid comparisons of results across studies. 
By collecting uniform and high -quality data on TBI, including bra in imaging scans and neurological test 
results, the database will help to address current challenges associated with wide variation across 
studies in how data are collected and described.  
The National Action Alliance  for Suicide Prevention  is a public -private partnership that includes 
representatives from NIH, CDC, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the 
U.S. Army, and other federal entities.  The Alliance’s mission is to help guide the implementation of the 
goals and objectives set forth in the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention.  NIMH is co -chairing an 
Alliance taskforce that aims to identify gaps in suicide research, including neuroscience  research, that 
demonstrate promise in advancing the goal of reducing suicide through prevention.  
NIMH provides leadership to the HHS Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee and works with other 
ICs, multiple HHS agencies, ED, and private research foundations to coordinate a national strategy for 
research on autism spectru m disorder . Each year, the Committee  releases an updated Strategic Plan for 
Autism Spectrum Disorder Research.  
Pain research activities at NIH are coordinated in large part by the NIH Pain Consortium —a joint 
undertaking across 25 ICs and Offices that ident ifies and facilitates implementation of key opportunities 
in collaborative pain research.  In 2010 –2011, the Consortium was proactive in coordina ting a number of 
pain research initiatives and activities at NIH , which included identifying key opportunities in pain 
research and education, convening conferences and workshops to highlight recent advances and needs 
in the field, and building collaborations with other federal agencies, such as the FDA, and academic 
institutions involved in pain research.  
  
 140 Life Stages, Human Development, and Rehabilitation   
Interactions among biological processes and physical and psychosocial factors in the environment shape 
an individual’s health and functional capacities from the ear liest formation of cells, tissues, organs, and 
organ systems through childhood, adulthood, and old age.  NIH research in this area focuses on healthy 
developmental processes and the ways in which these processes diverge , causing or contributing to 
much of t he nation’s heavy burden of disease and disability.  Some disorders of altered developmental 
processes, such as neural tube defects, are apparent at birth.  Others, including intellectual and 
developmental disabilities, obesity, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, cancers, mental illnesses, 
and dementias, may not emerge until months, years, or decades later.  
Human development progresses most rapidly during gestation and early childhood but continues 
throughout the course of life.  Each developmental stage l ays the foundation for health or illness in 
subsequent stages.  This means that the developmental aspects of NIH research have critical implications 
for public health.  Understanding precisely what happens during developmental “windows” of 
heightened sensiti vity to infections, toxic exposures, personal behaviors, and a host of other 
environmental factors is essential to learning how and when to intervene most effectively to prevent or 
lessen chronic and disabling conditions.  This concept, which has been terme d the Developmental Origins 
of Health and Disease (DOHaD), is based on extensive human epidemiologic data and experimental 
animal models.  DOH aD data and models from NIH -supported research demonstrate that the risk of poor 
adult health is associated with environmental influences during fetal development and infancy, as well 
as influences affecting transgenerational inheritance . Initial research o n DOHaD  focused primarily on 
nutritional factors contributing to disease; however, other environmental factors during development 
are now also being linked to the risk of non -communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, metabolic syndrom e, and chronic lung diseases.  The potential implications of DOHaD  research 
are great , as more than 35 million deaths per year —60 percent  of all global deaths —are attributed to 
non-communicable diseases .191 
This area of NIH research also encompasses medical r ehabilitation, including tissue regeneration, to 
optimize the functioning of individuals with disabling conditions.  Medical rehabilitation research is the 
study of physiologic mechanisms, methods of treatment, and devices that serve to improve, restore, or  
replace underdeveloped, lost, damaged, or deteriorated function.  A key aspect of medical rehabilitation 
research is its focus on the effects of functional problems on the whole person, rather than a single 
organ system.  Thus, it views the individual in th e context of a dynamic system of interacting variables, 
including  biological , psychosocial, and environmental factors.  
The role of developmental processes in the risks for common and rare disorders and in rehabilitation 
science means that the scope of NIH research in life stages, human development, and rehabilitation is 
quite broad.  This research area includes basic research on molecular and cellular processes to gain

 141 insights into the trajectories of human development and disease and even to harness develo pmental 
processes such as cell differentiation for therapeutic and rehabilitative uses.  This research area also 
includes the collection and analysis of data over the lifespan or over a specific period of interest, such as 
childhood or older age . Such studies can suggest the relative contributions to health or to specific 
disorders of environmental exposures and ongoing developmental and disease processes.  Also included 
are studies of specific disorders with an emphasis on an individual’s life stage or developmental status.  
As the institute with statutory responsibility for child health and human development research, NICHD 
conducts and supports research programs in reproductive health and in the developmental processes 
that begin before conception and c ontinue through adolescence.  As the Institute with statutory 
responsibility for research on aging, NIA conducts and supports research on both the maintenance and 
loss of functions during the aging process, diseases associated with aging, and the problems a nd needs 
of older individuals and their caregivers.  NINR supports research across all life stages to build the 
scientific foundation for clinical practice and managing and eliminating symptoms caused by illness, and 
it also is the designated lead institute  for end -of-life research.  NIEHS focuses on the influences of 
environmental agents on the development and progression of specific diseases.  
Numerous other ICs support life stages, human development, and rehabilitation research in cancer, 
diabetes, addictio n, mental health, musculoskeletal and neurological disorders, and other areas relevant 
to their missions.  ORWH, among its many roles, works across all ICs to develop and support 
opportunities for research and training in the study of disorders relevant to women’s health across the 
lifespan and sex and gender differences in disease.  Mission -specific rehabilitation research is supported 
by multiple Institutes, including NEI, NIA, NIBIB, NICHD, NIDCD, NIDCR, and NINDS.  A focal point for this 
research is NICHD’ s National Center on Medical Rehabilitation Research, which emphasizes the 
rehabilitation and lifelong care of people with physical disabilities resulting from stroke, injury, and 
other disorders.  
Many sections of this report include data on the burden of illness of specific conditions in which 
developmental -environmental interactions are or may be implicated.  Comprehensive data on the total 
burden of these conditions do not appear to be available.  The magnitude of this burden, however, is 
exemplified by ju st a single condition, the complex problem of obesity and its associated conditions, 
including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, pregnancy complications, certain cancers, 
osteoarthritis, liver and gall bladder disease, and depression.  CDC estimates the prevalence of obesity 
among individuals ages 20 years and older in the U.S. as 3 5.7 percent, and the prevalence of obesity plus 
overweight as 68.8  percent.192 Overweight and obesity also exert a substantial economic toll on the U.S., 
with the combination  of direct health care costs plus indirect costs, such as lost wages caused by illness, 
estimated to be $117 billion for the year 2002.  
Estimating the burden of functional limitations for which rehabilitation may be indicated is complicated 
by lack of cons ensus on the definition of “disability,” appropriate survey measures, and other issues.  The 
Institute of Medicine (IOM) defines disability as impairments in body structure or function, limitations 
                                                 
192 Flegal KM, et al. JAMA.  2012;307(5):491 –7. PMID: 22253363.  
 142 on activities such as dressing and other daily personal car e, and limitations on participation in such 
activities as school and work.  IOM reported that between 40 million and 50 million individuals,193 or 
about one in seven Americans, have some type of disability.  
NIH Funding for Life Stages, Human Development, and Rehabilitation Research  
NIH funding for rehabilitation research was $458 million in FY 20 10 and $459 in FY 2011 for non -ARRA 
(regular appropriations) and $93 million in FY 2010 for ARRA appropriations.194 Currently, NIH does not 
collect the trans -NIH funding  data necessary to provide an aggregate figure for expenditures on life 
stages  and human development  research .  
Summary of NIH Activities  
The goal of NIH life stages, human development, and rehabilitation research is to enable individuals to 
achieve a full  life with the best health and function at every life stage.  Understanding complex 
developmental pathways to health or illness throughout the life course is critical to creating new ways 
to prevent disease and disability before they become symptomatic, or even preempting the disease 
process before it starts.  Basic, clinical, and translational research all rest on the fundamental concept of 
developmental science, that the formation and function of cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, and the 
fully formed i ndividual are sensitive to protective or harmful environmental factors, and especially so at 
specific stages.  These factors include physical agents, such as industrial and agricultural chemicals ; 
tobacco , alcohol,  and other drugs of abuse;  microbial infections ; nutritional deficits ; and even medical 
treatments , such as pharmaceuticals and radiation.  Powerful environmental influences also include 
behaviors of individuals and of those with whom a person lives or works, and norms and values of  
households, families, schools, workplaces, and communities.  Sex and gender differences affect 
developmental trajectories and disease risks.  All such factors can have immediate, intermediate, and/or 
long -term effects on human health and function.  
Human Dev elopment  
In studies of the most fundamental molecular and cellular processes, NIH scientists continually expand 
understanding of how development typically progresses, what goes awry and why, and how health is 
affected.  For example, epigenetic influences on  the expression of genes may be critical mechanisms for 
gene/environment interactions that influence health and development.  Understanding these subtle 
interactions is an essential step toward discovering treatments and preventive strategies.  NIH has 
estab lished the  Common Fund Epigenomics Program to stimulate the creation of important new 
scientific resources for epigenetics researchers and thus speed progress toward applications that affect 
human health and common, complex human diseases.  A major effort i n the program is characterizing 
the epigenome; that is, creating a catalog of stable epigenetic modifications that occur in the genome 
(all genes encoded in the DNA).  Among other things, Common Fund  epigenomics resources may become

 143 the basis for studies of  diabetes, including the effects of the intrauterine environment on later risk of 
disease development . 
Basic research in developmental biology also may enable scientists to harness powerful normal cellular 
processes for therapeutic purposes.  Research on ce ll senescence, a significant factor in  normal aging, 
one day may yield understanding of cellular mechanisms that act to block the development of cancer as 
well as specific characteristics of aging.  Goals of human embryonic stem cell research include explai ning 
critical events in early human development that could lead to developing customized regenerative 
medical interventions.  Sex and gender differences affect developmental trajectories and disease risks.  
Basic research is only one essential component of t he NIH portfolio of multiple methodological 
approaches to understanding human development.  For example, with NIH support, investigators are 
assembling a unique database of anatomical neuroimages of children’s brains over time.  This database 
also will inclu de clinical, behavioral, demographic, and cognitive data on the children, thus enabling 
scientists to understand the multiple dimensions of normal human brain development.  This knowledge 
is also critical to understanding the effect of environmental “insult s” to the brain, such as drug use 
during  pregnancy.  Such understanding is essential in elucidating intellectual and developmental 
disabilities, pediatric neurological diseases, and many other disorders that emerge in childhood.  The 
multi -decade Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) has created a wealth of information that has 
helped scientists —and the public —understand distinctions between physical changes attributable to the 
aging process and those caused by disease.  These data have yielded importa nt insights on, among other 
things, relationships between age -related changes in the arteries and cardiovascular disease and 
differences between normal declines in cognitive ability related to age and those associated with 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and rela ted conditions.  
Life Stages  
“Life stages” or “life course” research is a concept that informed landmark epidemiological and 
longitudinal studies.  These studies linked risks of major adult -onset disorders, including type 2 diabetes, 
hypertension, stroke, an d heart disease, to environmental influences in utero  and in early childhood.  
The life -course research model has expanded to include a greater number of developmental stages and 
a wide array of environmental factors and conditions of interest, with a goal of determining how —and 
when —to intervene to prevent or treat disease.  The NIH -supported Breast Cancer and the Environment 
Research Centers  (BCER C) is a transdisciplinary initiative cosponsored by NCI and NIEHS, in which basic 
scientists, epidemiologists, c linicians, and community partners work together to examine the effects of 
environmental exposures that may predispose a woman to breast cancer throughout her life.  Specific 
attention is given to puberty, menopause, pregnancy, and other windows of susceptib ility when the 
developing breast may be at particular risk from environmental exposures.  
NIH-supported research on maternal and childhood obesity seeks to understand complex interactions 
among genetic, psychological, physiological, familial, community, environmental, and other factors in 
this major public health problem.  The goals of such research include understanding  the rapid, recent 
increases in rates of obesity and determining how and when to intervene to achieve lasting effect.  NIH 
findings of high ra tes of overweight and other major risk factors for type 2 diabetes in middle school 
 144 students are the basis for current trials of school -based diet and exercise interventions.  The goal of the 
interventions is to decrease the children’s short - and longer -term risks for obesity and type 2 diabetes.  
Research that led to universal newborn screening for phenylketonuria and for hypothyroidism and 
immediate initiation of treatment for affected infants to protect their developing brains has virtually 
eliminated intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) associated with these conditions.  NIH is 
funding a major initiative to speed the development of highly efficient technology for screening 
newborns for very large numbers of additional rare genetic conditions and to accelerate the discovery of 
treatments for such conditions.  This initiative also includes support for networked facilities that can 
translate scientific discoveries quic kly into clinical practice.  
NIH investments in understanding and developing interventions for Fragile X and Down syndromes and 
other IDDs include support for 14 IDD centers.  These centers provide core research resources in genetics 
and proteomics as well as clinical infrastructure for a wide range of studies.  Multiple NIH -supported 
programs focus on autism spectrum disorder . For example, the Autism Centers for Excellence include (a) 
six centers focusing research on possible causes of autism spectrum disord er, including genetic, 
immunological, and environmental factors, and (b) five networks focusing on causes, preventive 
interventions, and improved treatment.  High priority will be placed on identifying autism spectrum 
disorder  risk factors, biological signatures of autism spectrum disorder , and evaluating interventions in 
understudied populations.  NIH established an intramural research program to accelerate development 
and testing of innovative treatments for autism spectrum di sorder . This program has already evaluated 
hundreds of children and tested three novel compounds.  
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is abnormal blood vessel development in the eyes of some infants 
born severely premature, which can lead to blindness if not treated in time. NEI is funding a clinical trial 
that uses telemedicine as a tool for doctors to remotely diagnose ROP in premature infants born in rural 
and underserved areas. Other pediatric vision research is addressing the increasing incidence of myopi a 
(nearsightedness). Recent NEI research has found that the amount of time children spend outdoors may 
reduce the risk of developing myopia, whereas near work, such as reading a book or a computer screen, 
is not necessarily related to myopia and other refr active errors, as long hypothesized.  
The tendencies toward risky behaviors attributed to immaturity of the brain in adolescence makes this 
developmental stage of interest in studies of substance abuse  and addiction.  In seeking to understand 
how developmen tal stage may influence vulnerability to, or protection from drug abuse, scientists are 
beginning to understand how a range of environmental variables, including quality of parenting, drug 
exposure, socioeconomic status, and neighborhood characteristics, i nfluence brain development and 
behavior.  Recent studies have uncovered specific genetic variants linked to heightened risk of future 
drug problems in those who started using during adolescence.  Researchers also are testing preventive 
strategies such as  universal approaches that engage broad youth audiences to address a panoply of risk 
behaviors; s elective interventions that target groups of individuals at increased risk (relative to the 
general population) ; indicated prevention interventions that focus on individuals who have begun using 
drugs but are not yet diagnosed with a disorder ; or t iered interventions that include a combination of 
universal, selective, and indicated approaches.  Better understanding of relationships between 
 145 developmental stages an d disease processes may be critical to the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.  
In another example, NIH -supported research on brain development in children with attention -
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) showed a normal pattern of brain development but with a 
significant delay in maturation of the prefrontal cortex between the ages of five and 15 years.  Scientists 
now are investigating the effects of treatment on rates of cortical maturation.  
On the other end of the age spectrum, NIH conducts and su pports a large and diverse research portfolio 
on aging and age -related diseases, including biochemical, genetic, and physiological mechanisms of 
aging in humans and animal models; structure and function of the aging nervous system; social and 
behavioral as pects of aging processes; and pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 
age-related diseases and disabilities.  One of the longest ongoing longitudinal studies of aging ever 
conducted , the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA)  has been  active for over half a century.  The 
main focus has been to describe physiological parameters and longitudinal trajectories of change in 
these parameters in participants of different ages, initially free of major diseases at the time of 
enrollment. The und erlying goal is to discriminate changes due to “normal aging” from those generated 
by age -associated conditions. Findings from the BLSA in this regard have contributed substantially to 
current knowledge of the physiology of aging. Incorporating major techn ological advancements in 
assessment of physiologic and biomarkers of aging and theoretical refinements, the BLSA continues to 
pursue the following objectives: (1) describe longitudinal trajectories of the major aging phenotypes, (2) 
identify genetic, physi ological, behavioral and environmental factors that affect the rate of change in 
these phenotypes and (3) understand the interrelationship between aging phenotypes and highly 
prevalent chronic conditions and their independent and joint impact on age -relate d decline in physical 
and cognitive function . 
In order to develop a comprehensive picture of the health and disability of older Americans, NIH 
supports t he Health and Retirement Study (HRS)  and the National  Health  and Aging  Trends  Study  
(NHATS).  The HRS has surveyed more than 22,000 Americans aged 50  and older  every two years since 
1992, collecting data on income, work, assets, pension plans, health insurance, disability, physical health 
and functioning, cognitive functioning, psychosocial stress, and healt h expenditures. Self-report and 
biomarker measures of health are combined with  Medicare data on utilization of health services.  ARRA 
funds have facilitated the expansion of the study to include participant genotyping and doubling the 
minority sample.  The National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) replaced the National Long -Term 
Care Survey as the source of research data on national disability trends and dynamics among the senior 
population of the U.S. This study has just completed the collection of  baseline data, which will become 
available to the research community in spring  2012.  
Clinical trials  are being supported by NIH in order to understand the potential genetic factors that 
contribute to exceptional survival (the Long Life Family Study) . Thes e trials will  test treatments for 
health conditions common to old age, including testosterone supplementation to delay or prevent frailty 
in older men; effects of exercise on mood, health, and cognition; and, an array of interventions for 
menopausal sympto ms. 
 146 Research on normal maturational processes may lead to new ways to treat or prevent disorders 
associated with aging.  NIH conducts and supports a large and diverse portfolio of research on aging  and 
age-related diseases and conditions, including the biochemical, genetic, and physiological mechanisms 
of aging  in humans and animal models; structur al and function al changes in  the aging nervous system; 
social and behavioral aspects of aging  processes and the place of older people in society; and the 
patho physiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of age -related diseases, degenerative conditions, 
and disabilities.  For example, NIDCD -funded investigators hope to identify gene mutations that 
contribute to age -related hearing loss, understand structural consequences of such mutations, and 
investigate protein function of these genes to inform better prevention and treatment strategies.  
NIA’s Interventions  Testing  Program  (ITP), which began in 2003, supports the testing of interventions 
including foods, diets, drugs, and hormones  with the potential to extend the lifespan and delay disease 
and dysfunction in a mouse model of  aging . ITP investigators found that the drug rapamycin can 
increase lifespan in both male and female mice.  Further research is ongoin g. 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in older Americans, will impose 
an increasing burden in future years as the baby boomer generation ages. The Age -Related Eye Disease 
Study (AREDS) demonstrated that antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplemen ts reduced the 
progression to advanced AMD by about 25 percent. Building on these landmark findings, the follow up 
study  is assessing additional supplements (lutein, zeaxanthin, and long -chain omega -3 fatty acids) as a 
treatment for AMD and cataracts. It is also evaluating effects of eliminating beta -carotene and/or 
reducing zinc in the original AREDS formulation on AMD progression.   
NIH makes major investments in research to understand the onset and progress of Alzheimer’s disease , 
the most common form of dementia in aging, and to discover how to slow its progress and, ultimately, 
to prevent it.  In April 2010, NIH held a State of the Science Conference on Preventing AD and Cognitive 
Decline  in which the conference panel determined that there is insufficient  scientific evidence to 
support use of any interventions to prevent cognitive decline or Alzheimer’s disease . In 2009, expert 
panels convened by the NIA and Alzheimer’s Association began meeting to update the clinical diagnostic 
criteria for the disease.  Completed in April 2011, the NIA/Alzheimer’s Association Diagnostic Guidelines 
for Alzheimer’s disease established a paradigm for diagnosing and researching the disorder.  The 
updated guidelines cover the full spectrum of Alzheimer’s disease as it gradually develops over many 
years and addresses the use, primarily in the research setting, of brain imaging and biomarkers that may 
help diagnose Alzheimer’s disease at earlier stages.   
At all stages of life, individuals with chronic or critical illnesses and their families and clinical caretakers 
need evidence -based guidance and support in managing chronic illness and transitioning to the end of 
life. End-of-life science seeks to understand dying with respect to the needs of dying persons and formal 
and inform al caregivers.  It includes research on such issues as: alleviation of symptoms, psychological 
care, near -death preferences, advance directives, and family decision -making.  Likewise, end -of-life 
research addresses the cultural, spiritual, age -, and disease -specific factors that make each person’s 
experience at the end of life unique.  NIH end -of-life research applies biological, behavioral, and social 
science strategies to advance the understanding of the dynamic interactions of these various factors and 
 147 to develop interventions that optimize patient and caregiver quality of life across care settings and 
cultural contexts.  NIH recently sponsored an initiative to develop and test interventions to enhance end -
of-life and palliative care, which providers can impl ement across multiple settings, illnesses, and cultural 
contexts.  NIH-supported Centers in Self Management or End -of-Life research are important loci for 
interdisciplinary research in this area.  In August 2011, NINR, in partnership with NIA, NCCAM, ORDR, 
ORWH, and the NIH CC Office of Bioethics, convened a three -day nation al summit on “The Science of 
Compassion: Future Directions in End -of-Life and Palliative Care.”  The summit examined the state of 
research and clinical practice in end -of-life and palliativ e care and provided an opportunity for scientists, 
health care professionals, and public advocates to come together to catalyze and shape the future 
research agenda for this critical scientific area.  
Rehabilitation  
The goal of rehabilitation science is to enable individuals with functional impairments associated with 
congenital disorders, chronic diseases, or events such as stroke or traumatic injury to live full and 
productive lives, as independently as possible.  Developmental stages are a central consider ation in this 
research, because differences among age groups, including physiology and physical size, psychosocial 
trajectories, and expected lifespan, must all be taken into account in rehabilitation interventions.  
An important focus of rehabilitation res earch is the interface between medicine and engineering.  
Scientists explore innovative biomedical technologies and test their capacity to resolve stubborn 
medical problems and enhance mobility, sensory, and other functions of individuals with disabling 
conditions.  NIH projects in rehabilitation neuroscience also pursue the development of prosthetics and 
other devices to restore or enhance the capacity to function in those who lose limbs because of injury, 
combat, or complications from diseases such as diabe tes. Researchers are capitalizing on new advances 
in technology that resulted in a successful prototype “bionic arm” to create a next -generation “bionic 
hand.”  Rerouting nerve endings and attaching more electrodes could restore a rudimentary sense of 
touch  and allow users to control robotic fingers with their brain.  
Basic processes of cellular and molecular development and function offer great potential for 
rehabilitation research and clinical applications.  Scientists are seeking to understand both the 
mechanisms that underlie functional impairments and the therapeutic potential of such basic 
developmental processes as cell differentiation.  A major collaboration between the NIH intramural 
program and the Department of Defense is the new Center for Neuros cience and Regenerative Medicine 
(CNRM) whose mission is to  enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality -of-life of 
people with disabilities by supporting a broad range of research, including efforts to understand the 
underlying biology of i njury and disability, and the body’s normal mechanisms of recovery and 
adaptation.  These activities include a special emphasis on research related to spinal cord injury (SCI), 
traumatic brain injury (TBI), and stroke.  The Center’s mission also includes cat alyzing advances in 
treatment, rehabilitation, and long -term recovery for individuals experiencing TBI.  Even seemingly mild 
forms of TBI can seriously disrupt short - and long -term brain function.  Because past studies of single 
agents were largely unsuccess ful in improving TBI outcomes, new efforts involve multiple drug 
combinations and molecules to inhibit swelling, inflammation, and other biochemical reactions that can 
 148 harm brain tissue after TBI.  One such combination under study is progesterone and vitami n D. 
Progesterone is known to protect the brain from injury; however, it is much less effective in individuals 
who have low levels of vitamin D.  Other efforts address the difficulties with concentration and attention 
often reported by individuals with TBI.  One relevant project compares the effectiveness of behavioral 
therapy, centered on improving concentration and emotional control, to drug treatment with 
methylphenidate, often prescribed for attention deficit disorder.  
The Clinical Center is working with many ICs in leading the investigator -coordinated NIH intramural Bone 
Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSC) Transplantation Center, where clinical grade BMSCs , shown to have a 
therapeutic effect on several injuries and diseases, are being produced and us ed for the treatment of 
patients with acute graft -versus -host disease.  Ultimately, the BMSCs produced by this Center could be 
used for the treatment of a variety of human diseases and disorders.  
NIDCR supports interdisciplinary basic and translational rese arch for engineering and regeneration of 
functional oral and craniofacial tissues, including research aimed at improving the capacity of oral and 
craniofacial tissues to heal and regenerate themselves with the help of a variety of novel therapeutic 
agents.  In one example, NIDCR is supporting a study that demonstrates how mechanical forces 
originating outside a cell become transmitted into cell's nucleus to direct early tooth development. This 
advance will help to derive new approaches that employ mechanical  and other biophysical forces to 
mimic early developmental events for regeneration of an adult tooth, and has important implications for 
skeletal bone development as well.195 
NIH participates with DoD and other agencies for the Armed Forces Institute of Rege nerative Medicine 
in a multi -agency effort to develop and advance treatment options for severely wounded service men 
and women ( http://www.nibib.nih.gov/About/Overview/DDSTFactSheet  and http://www.afirm.mil/ ). 
Research projects aim to develop new products and therapies to address the growing prevalence of 
complex and life -threatening injuries and help those who have been wounded to reach their highest  
potential.  Research projects are advancing wound healing therapies that prevent and manage scar 
formation; developing novel treatments to reduce the high morbidity and mortality from burn wounds; 
developing therapies that promote regeneration of bone mate rial for craniofacial reconstruction; and 
developing finger and limb reconstruction, regeneration or transplantation.

 149 Chronic Diseases and Organ Systems   
Chronic diseases are defined by HHS as conditions that last a year or more and require ongoing medical 
attention and/or limit activities of daily living. Chronic diseases place a considerable burden on the U.S. 
health care system, the national economy, and the health and lives of individual patients and their 
families. Not all chronic diseases are f atal; however, seven of every 10 Americans who die each year —
more than 1.7 million people —succumb to a chronic disease.196 Health -damaging behaviors such as drug 
use (e.g., tobacco, excessive alcohol, or other drug), lack of physical activity, poor eating ha bits, and 
obesity, contribute to many chronic diseases, whereas others may result from the long -term effect of 
early exposure to toxins or other environmental factors, especially in individuals with a higher genetic 
risk of disease. Some chronic diseases a nd conditions may affect more than one organ. For example, 
diabetes can affect the pancreas, heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerve endings in the limbs. People with 
serious mental illness are more likely to suffer with chronic diseases that are associated with a ddiction 
(especially nicotine), obesity (sometimes associated with antipsychotic medication), and poverty (with 
its attendant poor nutrition and health care), and they may suffer the adverse health consequences 
earlier. For these reasons, modern medicine r equires an integrated understanding of the complex 
interactions among multiple organs, the nervous system, the circulatory system, the immune system, 
and the endocrine system.  
A shared aspect of many chronic diseases is chronic pain and other disease -asso ciated disabilities that 
interfere with quality of life. A recent study shows that approximately 1 00 million American adults —
more than the total affected by heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined —suffer from chronic 
pain.197 As many as 75 million Ameri cans suffer from two or more concurrent chronic conditions,198 
placing them at risk for worse overall health and significant financial burden, including higher 
prescription drug and total out -of-pocket health care spending.   
Thus, research to combat chronic illness involves significant trans -NIH collaboration in addition to the 
mission -specific work of each IC. NIH supports basic research on both normal and disease states of 
organ systems to understand the initiation and progression of chronic diseases, as we ll as translational 
and clinical research on new biomedical and behavioral strategies to prevent, preempt, diagnose, treat, 
and cure these diseases. The ultimate goal is to reduce or eliminate morbidity and mortality while 
improving quality of life for tho se living with these often debilitating conditions.  
This section provides information about NIH’s activities related to a number of major chronic diseases, 
as well as research on aspects of the function of various organ systems. Additional major chronic 
diseases are discussed in the sections “Cancer” (cancers of all organs and tissues, including blood),

 150 “Neurosciences” (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, and epilepsy), “Autoimmune 
Diseases” (e.g., lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid a rthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease s), and 
“Infectious Diseases and Biodefense” (e.g., HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis). Because some people with 
certain chronic diseases require transplantation to replace a diseased organ or tissue, organ 
transplantatio n research and the related issue of establishing immune tolerance to transplanted organs 
(i.e. ensuring the organ is not rejected by the recipient’s immune system) are highlighted in this section. 
Research on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) ap proaches to combating chronic disease 
also is discussed. NIH supports research to reduce the pain associated with long -term diseases and to 
find innovative and effective forms of palliative care to relieve disease symptoms. Some of these efforts 
were  highl ighted in the Neuroscienc  section . 
The prevalence and burden of chronic diseases are substantial. About 133 million Americans —nearly 
half of adults —live with at least one chronic illness.199 Chronic disease disables or limits activity for 
almost 12 percent o f all adults, including more than one -third of adults ages 65 and older.200 Notably, 
the percentage of U.S. children and adolescents with a chronic health condition has increased 
significantly, from 1.8 percent in the 1960s to more than 7 percent in 2004. Fu rthermore, the increasing 
prevalence of patients with one or multiple chronic diseases has a significant impact on health care 
delivery and the economy; more than 75 percent of health care costs are related to treatment of chronic 
conditions.201 
Many chronic  diseases that lead to significant disability develop over time and become more prevalent 
with age (e.g., osteoarthritis, chronic kidney disease, vision loss). Less commonly, chronic disease may 
manifest from birth as a result of one or more faulty genes ( e.g., sickle cell anemia, hemophilia) or at 
other times during childhood (e.g., allergies, asthma). Some chronic diseases are common in the U.S. 
population, as in the case of heart disease, which is the leading cause of death, while others are 
relatively r are, such as cystic fibrosis, which affects approximately 30,000 Americans. Certain chronic 
diseases and conditions represent growing public health issues, such as the increases in obesity and type 
2 diabetes in children and adults.  
Many chronic diseases and conditions that are common in the U.S., such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and 
heart disease, also have a substantial impact on global morbidity and mortality.  By 2015, chronic 
diseases will be the most common cause of death even in the poorest countrie s. In 2005, chronic 
diseases contributed approximately 60 percent of the 58 million total deaths in the world and almost 
three -quarters of the burden of disease (measured in disability -adjusted life -years202) in those ages 30 or 
older.203

 151 NIH Funding for Chron ic Diseases and Organ Systems Research  
Currently, NIH does not collect the data necessary to provide an aggregate figure for expenditures on 
chronic diseases and organ sy stems research. Appendix H  provides funding estimates for many of the 
areas of research associated with chro nic diseases and organ systems . Because of overlap among the 
areas of research listed in the table, and because research on chronic disease and organ systems may 
account for only a portion of the funding for a given area, the f igures in that table cannot be used to 
provide an aggregate number.  
Summary of NIH Activities  
NIH invests significant resources in the study of chronic diseases, and nearly all NIH ICs support research 
to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of  human physiology in the health and disease of 
organ systems. Such research has the potential to lead to new insights and treatments for chronic 
diseases. The diverse NIH research portfolio broadly encompasses research on the normal physiology of 
all organ  systems in the body; studies of rare and common diseases in both children and adults; 
development of devices and technologies for disease detection and diagnosis; evaluation of strategies 
for prevention and treatment that might be based on pharmaceuticals , behavioral modification, surgical 
techniques, mechanical devices, or other approaches; and translation of research results into real -world 
applications or resources for the benefit of patients who live with chronic diseases every day. This 
section highli ghts key examples of challenges, progress, and emerging opportunities in NIH -supported 
research on chronic diseases and organ health.  
Cardiovascular/Heart Diseases  
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a broad term used to  encompass many conditions, including h eart 
diseases such as coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, heart valve disease, sudden 
cardiac arrest, and congenital heart defects and various diseases and conditions of the blood vessels 
such as cerebrovascular disease (stroke), periphe ral arterial disease, and deep vein thrombosis. 
Coronary heart disease is the most common type of heart disease and a major cause of death in the U.S. 
for both men and women.  
As the lead institute for CVD research, NHLBI studies cover the spectrum of basic investigations, clinical 
and translational research, and implementation and dissemination research. About two -thirds of the 
nearly 4,000 CVD -related grants and research contracts funded by NHLBI involve  basic research. The 
clinical research funded by NHLBI includes observational studies, randomized clinical trials, comparative 
effectiveness research, implementation and dissemination research, and clinical studies of the effect 
behavioral and psychosocial factor s on CVD and risk.   
The Institute’s strong focus on basic and early translational studies is exemplified by support for large 
programs, many of which provide essential resources for investigators to conduct cutting -edge studies 
in areas such as genomics an d cell therapy. For example, t he Candidate Gene Association Resource  
(CARe)  is a shared resource for analyses of the association of genotypes with phenotypes relevant to the 
NHLBI mission. It comprises nine NHLBI -sponsored cohort studies —Atherosclerosis Ri sk in Communities 
 152 (ARIC), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Cleveland Family Study (CFS), Coronary Artery Risk 
Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Jackson Heart Study (JHS), 
Multi -Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and  Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS).  
The NHLBI Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium  is a cooperative investigative group that conducts 
clinical and translational research on the genetic causes of congenital heart disease and genetic 
contributions to outcome in individuals with congenital heart disease. In addition, t he Programs of 
Excellence in Nanotechnology  supports multidisciplinary teams to develop nanotechnology -based tools 
for the diagnosis and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases, and to move t he translation of these 
technologies towards clinical application.  Finally, t he NHLBI Gene Therapy Resource Program  facilitates 
the translation of gene therapy research into clinical interventions via provision of resources in the form 
of preclinical and c linical -grade vector production, pharmacology/toxicology testing, immunology 
testing, clinical trials funding assistance, and regulatory support.  
NHLBI supports a robust portfolio of clinical research, including clinical trials to answer key questions 
abou t therapeutic and preventive strategies for major diseases of the heart and blood vessels. Ongoing 
clinical trials address ing coronary heart disease examine a number of strategies including medications, 
stenting, revascularization, and angiography  to reduce the rate of recurrent myocardia l infarction  (heart 
attack) , stroke , and CVD -related  death. Clinical trials are  also underway to improve treatment for 
arrhythmia. For  example, t he Catheter Ablation versus Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial 
Fibrillation trial is evaluating drug therapy versus the use of catheter directed electrical impulses to 
control arrhythmia . To address hypertension, NHLBI is sponsoring a number of trials, including one to 
determine whether a target of lower blood pressure than current standard s will reduce the risk of heart 
and kidney disease, stroke, and/ or age -related decline in cognitive function. To better treatment of 
heart failure, NHLBI supports clinical trials to test the benefit of mechanical circulatory support th erapy 
using ventricular assist devices, surgical intervention, and medical therapy.   
NHLBI supports numerous trials to improve the treatment of pediatric heart disease.  For example, The 
Pumps for Kids, Infants, and Neonates (PumpKIN) program is testing dev ices to help children born with 
congenital heart defects or children who develop heart failure . The Therapeutic Hypothermia after 
Pediatric Cardiac Arrest trial is evaluating whether regulating body temperature will improve the 
outcome for children after c ardiac arrest.  
NHLBI also supports a number of collaborative research infrastructure  projects  to enable the conduct of 
clinical trials in areas of identified need and opportunity. For example, the Cardiovascular Cell Therapy 
Research Network  provides an infrastructure to evaluate innovative cell therapy strategies for 
individuals with CVD, and the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network  enables rigorous scientific 
comparisons and evaluation of newer surgical techniques, devices, and innovative pharmaceutical and 
bioengineered products to improve CVD outcomes in adult populations.  
NHLBI supports an extensive portfolio of behavioral research, including many studies to develop and 
evaluate interventions for improving eating and exercise patterns t o promote cardiovascular fitness, 
prevent weight gain, or promote weight loss. In addition, NHLBI Global Health Centers of Excellence 
 153 support  a worldwide network of research and training centers to prevent and control chronic diseases, 
including CVD. Each center is led by a research institution in a low - to middle -income developing country 
that is paired with at least one partner academic institution in a developed country to enhance research 
and training opportunities.  
Other NIH institutes also support CVD  research. For example, stroke  research at NINDS is comprehensive 
and includes research to obtain a better understanding of basic disease mechanisms; epidemiology 
studies to assess  stroke  risk, occurrence and outcomes in the population; clinical research t o develop 
effective prevention and acute treatment approaches; and development of strategies for improving 
recovery and rehabilitation in  stroke  patients. A number of NIH  stroke  trials are conducted through 
the NINDS Specialized Program of Translational Re search in  Stroke , a network of eight research centers 
across the country that is focused on improving management and outcomes of acute  stroke.204 
NIBIB supports a group of interdisciplinary researchers working to develop a new method of mechanical 
circulatory support and a total mechanical heart that may eliminate the need for anticoagulant drugs. 
Using cutting -edge simulation techniques to understa nd the blood flow through these devices and a 
technology called the “Device Thrombogenicity Emulator” to validate their method , the team will work 
with device manufacturers to improve the design of these mechanical devices.205 206 Improved designs 
will lead to  the elimination of difficult and costly anticoagulant drug therapy and pave the way for long -
term use of these mechanical devices, ultimately saving countless lives and reducing healthcare costs.  
Investments in CVD basic research have produced any number  of scientific advances. For example, many 
genetic factors have been identified that influence blood pressure.  In one study, a n international team 
of scientists examined  the genomes of 200,000 people, looking for DNA variants related to blood 
pressure. The  study found a number of previously unsuspected variants that influence blood pressure, 
providing new insights into the genetics and biology of blood pressure.207 NHLBI -supported scientists 
have reported development of a three -dimensional model of the main p rotein component of HDL as it 
occurs naturally in the body. HDL’s nickname “good” cholesterol comes from its ability to grab artery -
clogging cholesterol from cells and help dispose of it. Knowing the structure of this HDL protein should 
help researchers mi mic its function and perhaps ultimately develop new drugs to mimic its function and 
prevent atherosclerosis.208  
 In 2011, researchers reported analysis of health outcomes in postmenopausal women participating in 
the Women’s Health Initiative estrogen -alone trial who had undergone  a hysterectomy and had taken 
estrogen for an average of six years. They found that excess rates of stroke and blood clots among 
estrogen users – reasons for halting the trial in 2004 – disappeared during the subsequent  four years.

 154 Estrogen use during the trial did not increase or decrease the risks of death, heart disease, colorectal 
cancer, or hip fractures but did decrease breast cancer risk.   
New findings are promising revolutionary new approaches to CVD  treatment . For example, a recent 
study promises a potential new mechanism for repairing the heart after a heart attack. The heart’s 
natural capacity to repair itself is limited , and e ven when able to recover, resulting scar tissue impairs its 
ability to pump blood. Recent researc h showed that non -muscle, "fibroblast" cells, which make up more 
than half the cells in the heart, can be reprogrammed into other cell types — including muscle. Scientists 
identified a trio of gene -controlling proteins that, when "turned on", converted these fibroblasts in an 
injured mouse heart into beating heart muscle cells.209  
Results from a large clinical trial that compared surgical removal of artery -narrowing plaque to insertion 
of a metal tube or stent to reopen narrowed neck arteries showed that bot h are safe and effective in 
preventing  stroke. However, y ounger patients (aged < 70 years) fared better with stenting and older 
ones (aged > 70 years) with surgery. Based in large part on these results, an FDA panel voted to widen 
the use of carotid stenti ng, which will impact patient care.210 
NIDDK supports research on CVD as a common and devastating co -morbidity of diabetes, obesity, and 
kidney disease.  Clinical and basic studies are aimed at identifying and understanding factors and 
mechanisms that contribute to cardiovascular damage in these diseases, while clinical prevention trials 
are aimed at finding strategies to prevent CVD in people at risk.  For example, the NIDDK -led Look AHEAD 
(Action for Health in Diabetes)  clinical trial is determining wh ether a lifestyle intervention designed to 
promote weight loss can improve health outcomes, including prevention of heart disease, in obese 
people with type 2 diabetes.  The NIDDK is also leveraging landmark diabetes clinical trials through 
follow -up studie s that can reveal the long -term effects of trial interventions on the development of CVD 
and other health outcomes.  Already, one such study, the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and 
Complications Study , a follow up to the NIDDK’s landmark Diabetes Co ntrol and Complications Trial, has 
shown that tight glucose control prevents or delays the cardiovascular complications of type 1 diabetes.  
Similarly, new information about the relationship between CVD and type 2 diabetes should come from 
the Diabetes Prev ention Program Outcomes Study , a long -term follow up to the landmark Diabetes 
Prevention Program clinical trial.  Another large scale effort, the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort  
study, co -sponsored by NIDDK and NHLBI, is evaluating long -term cardiovascul ar risk and outcomes in 
persons with chronic kidney disease.  
Stroke research continues to make considerable advances, but there remain challenges that current and 
future research efforts will need to overcome, including neuroprotection strategies, disparit ies in stroke 
risk and burden, and expanding the time window for safe and effective use of tissue plasminogen 
activator (tPA) in breaking down blood clots. The NINDS Stroke Progress Review Group is undertaking  a 
five year review of challenges and prioritie s in stroke research and a new NINDS planning effort is 
currently underway to identify the most promising opportunities in  stroke prevention, treatment and 
recovery research. NHLBI is currently updating the adult clinical practice guidelines for hypertensi on,

 155 cholesterol, and obesity, all of which are risk factors for developing CVD. The project uses state -of-the-
art methodology for systematic evidence reviews and guideline development. Following  completion of 
these guidelines  NHLBI will undertake the devel opment of integrated CVD risk reduction guideline s. 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  
COPD  is a serious but largely preventable lung disease that makes breathing difficult. It has two forms, 
emphysema and chronic obstructive bronchitis, that tend to coexist in most people. Emphysema and 
chronic obstructive bronchitis damage the lungs in differe nt ways, but both make breathing difficult. 
COPD is the third most common cause of death in the U.S. More than 12 million Americans are currently 
diagnosed with COPD, and researchers estimate that 12 million more have it but do not know that they 
do. Docto rs diagnose COPD using a simple breathing test called spirometry that measures how well the 
lungs are working. Symptoms of COPD include chronic shortness of breath, a cough with mucus 
production, and wheezing. Smoking is the leading cause of COPD in the U. S., but genetic and 
environmental factors such as air pollution also play a role.  
Significant and ongoing research investments by the NIEHS are directed at uncovering the relationships 
between exposure to agents such as ozone, particulate matter, endotoxin s, excessive heat, and other 
environmental triggers and cardiopulmonary disease. One such discovery may lead to more effective 
treatment of COPD; a researcher studying toxic red tides has isolated a substance from the algae called 
brevenal that acts as an antitoxin and has been shown in animal studies to prevent, reduce, and reverse 
bronchoconstriction at very low doses.211 
Large, multi -center clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of several treatments/therapies that are 
available for immediate use. The  Long -term Oxygen Treatment Trial is testing the ability of supplemental 
oxygen treatment to prevent deaths and hospitalizations in patients with COPD and less -than -severe 
hypoxemia  (oxygen deficiency) . A trial conducted by NHLBI’s COPD Clinical Research N etwork is testing 
whether simvastatin, a drug approved for cardiovascular diseases, can be used to reduce the frequency 
of COPD exacerbations. Another trial is comparing the long -term immune response of COPD patients to 
two different pneumococcal vaccinati ons.  
Because COPD involves a wide range of abnormalities, different patients with COPD may require specific 
treatments. Studies are underway to define subgroups of patients for whom different therapeutic 
approaches should be used. The COPD  Gene study is ev aluating 10,000 current and former smokers, 
with and without COPD, to better categorize the various abnormalities seen on x -ray CT lung images and 
to identify genetic traits that are associated with specific manifestations of the disease. The Lung 
Genomic Research Consortium is performing state of the art, high -throughput molecular analyses of 
lung tissues removed from patients with COPD to find molecular “fingerprints” that indicate different 
subtypes of the disease. The SubPopulations and InteRmediate Out come Measures in COPD Study  will 
define subpopulations of COPD patients by extensive molecular and clinical phenotyping and will also 
identify intermediate outcome measures that can be used to improve the efficiency of future clinical 
trials.  
                                                 
211 Nguyen -Huu TD, et al. Toxicon . 2010;56(5):792 –6. PMID:  19682481.  
 156 COPD patients  often suffer from multiple afflictions. For example, lung cancer is 4 –5 times more 
frequent in COPD patients than in smokers without COPD. To investigate the cellular and molecular 
mechanisms that contribute to both COPD and lung cancer, NHLBI and NCI hav e recently awarded seven 
grants to promote research on the connections between these diseases of the lung, which together 
cause over a quarter of a million deaths in the U.S. each year.  
A number of recent studies are pointing towards better medical approa ches for treating COPD.  An 
antibiotic was found to decrease the frequency of exacerbations and improve quality of life.  A broccoli 
sprout derivative was found to potentially augment the anti -inflammatory effects of steroids in COPD.  
Researchers are testing  new approaches to protect against cigarette -smoke induced damage to the lung.  
For example, u sing an animal model of emphysema, a recent study showed a prominent role for the 
enzyme superoxide dismutase in protecting mice from cigarette smoke -induced damag e, suggesting 
that therapeutic interventions that augment SOD3 may be helpful.212 In another animal model, 
investigators identified a protein that mediates the rate of cell degradation  in mice exposed to cigarette 
smoke leading to epithelial cell death and a lveolar space enlargement. This observation suggests 
another therapeutic target in emphysema.213 
COPD is believed to have a strong genetic component. A genome -wide association study for COPD 
identified a potential gene related to susceptibility .214 In another  genome -wide association study, 
investigators identified several potential genes that may confer susceptibility  in an area of the genome 
that has pre viously been associated with cigarette smoking behavior. In similar studies, regions of the 
genome  were iden tified that could provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating pulmonary 
function.215 
While the effect size of these genetic variants is small in comparison with the estimated effect of 
cigarette smoke exposure, the discovery of additional geneti c risk variants for COPD is an important step 
toward the development of new preventative and therapeutic approaches for this disease. This work 
underscores the importance of gene environment interactions in determining individual susceptibility to 
COPD  and finding s in this area  may have practical implications for disease prevention.216 
As COPD accounts for more than 300 million patients worldwide, NHLBI is participating in discussions 
with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international groups regarding strategies for 
dealing with COPD at the global level. COPD surveillance d ata are being collected in developing countries 
through the NHLBI Centers of Excellence in Global Health. In addition to smoking, globally indoor air 
pollution also contributes to the risk for COPD. An NIH -wide workshop on indoor air pollution and cook

 157 Chronic Pain  and Palliative Care   
Many chronic diseases are associated with pain that can be chronic and severe. Pain often is di fficult to 
treat and can significantly erode patients’ quality of life. As discussed in the Neuroscience section, NIH 
supports a spectrum of pain research that includes basic science to understand the mechanisms of pain 
and pain relief, as well as clinical  research to evaluate pharmacological, surgical, and alternative 
strategies for pain management. Palliative care, which includes pain management, focuses on alleviating 
disease symptoms and improving patients’ quality of life. Optimizing end -of-life care i s an important 
topic within the field of palliative care research, particularly with respect to understanding the needs of 
dying children with chronic diseases and their families. Researchers also are studying the many cultural, 
spiritual, age -related, and  disease -specific factors that affect the end of life. Because each person’s 
experience at the end of life is unique, NIH has developed an initiative to support research on 
interventions for end -of-life and palliative care that can be applied in a variety of settings, illnesses, and 
cultural contexts.  
Chronic pain is a debilitating symptom of many long -term disease states such as cancer or arthritis. It 
may also manifest as a persistent pain state that outlasts an acute injury or illness, or arises in the 
absence of an identified causative mechanism. Persistent pain is widely considered to be a distinct 
disease state in itself. The transition from acute pain to a persistent and intractable condition involves 
improper functioning of neuronal pain circuits, in  which parts of the nervous system become 
hypersensitized for long or indefinite periods of time. It is unclear why some but not all people develop 
chronic pain after an acute insult has resolved. Common chronic pain conditions include migraine and 
other h eadaches, low back pain, cancer pain, arthritis pain, and neuropathic pain such as in diabetic 
neuropathy (pain resulting from damage to the peripheral nerves or to the central nervous system).  
Many chronic pain conditions are co -morbid or overlapping in nature with two or more conditions 
occurring simultaneously in the same patient. It is likely that some of these overlapping disorders share 
common mechanisms including genetic susceptibility. Overlapping pain conditions may include 
migraine, chronic fatig ue syndrome, endometriosis, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial 
cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJD), and vulvodynia. Chronic 
pain conditions can be exacerbated by environmental or psychosocial factor s. 
NIH funds a broad portfolio of chronic pain research activities ranging from basic research into the 
molecular, genetic, and bio -behavioral basis of chronic pain to large -scale clinical studies of potential 
treatments. NIH has leveraged various award me chanisms such as the Common Fund -sponsored 
Transformative Research  Award Program, ARRA -funded NIH Challenge grants and Grand Opportunity 
grants as well collaborative funding through  the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research to fund 
cutting -edge pain rese arch.  
Pain research activities at NIH are coordinated in large pa rt by the NIH Pain Consortium —a joint 
undertaking across 25 Institutes and offices that identifies and facilitates implementation of key 
opportunities in collaborative pain research. In 2010 –2011, the Consortium was proactive in 
coordina ting a number of pain research initiatives and activities at NIH which included identifying key 
 158 opportunities in pain research and education, convening conferences and workshops to highlight recent 
advances and  needs in the field, and building collaborations with other federal agencies, such as the 
FDA, and academic institutions involved in pain research. For example, members of the Pain Consortium 
currently participate in an advisory committee for the Analgesic  Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, 
Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION) initiative, a public -private partnership program sponsored by 
FDA to streamline the discovery and development of analgesics. In 2011, Pain Consortium members 
established worki ng groups for overlapping chronic pain conditions as well as chronic lower back pain.  
Led by NIDA  and in collaboration with members of the Consortium  12 health professional schools in May 
2012 were  designated  and funded as “Centers of Excellence for Pain Education” to develop, evaluate, 
and distribute pain management curriculum resources for medical, dental, nursing and pharmacy 
schools  to advance the assessment, diagnosis, and safe treatment of pain while minimizing risks o f 
addiction and diversion .217 
In addition to Trans -NIH efforts, NIH ICs fund chronic pain research aligned with their missions through 
joint funding opportunity announcements (FOA), workshops, and conferences. For example, NINDS 
focuses on headache and neuropathic pain research. The Institute recently released a headache 
planning meeting report218 detailing the opportunities, priorities, and recommendations for headache 
research . NINDS  is funding a ten -year study on overlapping pain conditions that disprop ortionately 
affect women, including episodic migraines  and is also funding a comparative effectiveness trial of drugs 
used to prevent pediatric migraine. Results are expected to have a significant effect on clinical practice 
and could help to establish cli nical practice guidelines for headache management in children and 
adolescents.  
In 2011, NEI created a new program for ocular pain and funded new projects to examine the neurons 
and pathways involved in corneal pain.  NINR sponsors numerous training opportun ities to develop 
improved research capacity in the science of pain, such as its intramural Methodologies Boot Camp. Also 
in 2011, NINR released a FOA to stimulate research that will link basic genomic discovery to the 
prevention and alleviation of symptoms  in patients suffering from chronic disorders, while its intramural 
program is focused on studying the molecular -genetic mechanisms of pain and analgesia at the level of 
the individual. NCCAM recently funded two Centers of Excellence for Research on Comple mentary and 
Alternative Medicine to understand neural processing of chronic low -back pain using neuroimaging to 
elucidate how mind -and-body interventions affect these processes.  
To coordinate, complement , and inform pain research goals  and follow  recommen dations from the 
Institute of Medicine ,219 NIH has designated NINDS as the lead Institute for coordinating pain research 
efforts across the organization; selected a cadre of 11 Centers of Excellence for Pain Education; begun to 
develop new informational mate rial for the public and medical professionals on pain conditions; and 
instituted more frequent meetings of the NIH Pain Consortium. NIH convened a number of conferences, 
workshops, and strategic planning efforts on chronic pain conditions in 2011 –2012 . For  example, i n April

 159 2011, ORWH and the Trans -NIH Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Research Working 
Group held a  State  of the Knowledge  Workshop  on Myalgic  Encephalomyelitis/Chronic  Fatigue  Syndrome  
Research . Also in April 2011, the Pain Co nsortium’s 6th Annual Symposium on Advances in Pain Research  
was held on the NIH campus, entitled Mechanisms  and Management  of Overlapping  Chronic  Pain  and 
Associated  Conditions . In June 2011, NIDCR and other ICs sponsored the Sixth Scientific Meeting of t he 
TMJ Association titled  Comorbid  Chronic  Pain  Conditions  – Mechanisms,  Diagnosis  and Treatments . In 
September 2011, ORWH held a seminar and panel discussion on Sex Differences  and Pain  Research . 
Understanding and managing chronic pain is hampered by the neurobiological and psychosocial 
complexity of the conditions and by the individual variation in susceptibility to chronic pain, perception 
of pain, and response to pain therapies. Challenges include basic research outcomes on chronic pain 
that poorly pred ict clinical applications of the research findings and pose as barriers to therapy 
development. Current animal models do not reflect the complexity of pain disorders, and assays for pain 
in animals and humans are not well matched. Priorities for advancing pain research include 
understanding how acute pain transitions to chronic pain, identifying biological pain signals, determining 
the risks and predictors of who will develop one or more chronic pain conditions, who will respond to 
certain therapies, as wel l as developing alternative pain medications with reduced abuse liability. For 
instance, NCCAM’s Third Strategic Plan (2011 –2015)220 highlights its commitment to advancing 
understanding of pain and pain relief through complementary and integrative health approaches. NIDCR 
plans to invest in understanding the genomics of chronic orofacial pain, which often co -occurs with 
other chronic pain disorders, to better inform prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of pain disorders.  
NIH’s significant investment in pain research has recently provided important advances in our basic 
understanding of pain and our ability to treat it.  For example, a  gene variant discovered by NIH 
researchers protects some people from chronic pain after ba ck surgery  due to variations in signaling 
pathways . The team is now clinically testing an analgesic drug to target these signaling pathways.221 NIH-
funded research has identified a family of so -called Piezo proteins that are ion channel proteins essential 
to the sensation of painful touch and new therapeutic targets for the treatment of pain222 and another 
study demonstrated  that variations in th e gene  that encodes receptors for the hormone vasopressin  are 
associated with pain sensitivity in a stress - and sex -specific manner in both mice and men.223 NIH 
supported scientists have show n that transplantation of neuron precursors into adult spinal cord can 
reduce injury -induced neuropathic pain.224 Finally, res earch has demonstrated that m assage therapy 
helps reduce pain and improve function more rapidly than usual medical care in people with chronic 
low-back pain, according to a NIH -funded study published in the  Annals  of Internal  Medicine.225

 160 As mentioned above, NINDS has been designated as the lead IC for pain research at NIH. In this role, the 
NINDS director, a longtime member of the Pain Consortium Executive Committee, has been appointed 
as the Chair of the committee, and will work to cataly ze and coordinate enhanced trans -NIH research 
efforts on pain. As a reflection of this enhanced activity level, the Pain Consortium moved to a more 
frequent quarterly meeting schedule.  The I nteragency Pain Research Coordinating Committee  was 
recently created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to enhance pain research efforts 
and promote collaboration across the government, advance fundamental understanding of pain, and 
improve pain -related treatment strategies.   
Chronic Pelvic Pain  
Chronic pelvic pain is a general term that health care providers use to describe pain that occurs mostly 
or only in the lower abdominal area. It may be steady pain, or recurrent. It includes conditions affecting 
and/or originating in the genito urinary and GI tracts. Common health conditions associated with chronic 
pelvic pain include:  
• Interstitial  cystitis/painful  bladder  syndrome  (IC/PBS):  pelvic pain strongly associated with the 
bladder and with urinary symptoms of frequency and urgency;  
• Chron ic prostatitis/chronic  pelvic  pain  syndrome  (CP/CPPS):  prostate pain seemingly due to 
inflammation, but in the absence of bacteria and even, sometimes, of host inflammatory cells in 
urine or prostatic fluid;  
• Vulvodynia:  chronic pain or discomfort of the vu lva; 
• Endometriosis:  occurs when tissues that usually line a woman’s uterus instead grow outside the 
uterus;  
• Uterine  fibroids:  common, non -cancerous tumors that grow within and around the wall of the 
uterus; and  
• Irritable  bowel  syndrome  (IBS):  a functional GI disorder whose symptoms include abdominal 
pain.  
NIH supports a wide range of basic, clinical, and translational research to better understand the causes 
of chronic pelvic pain conditions and to find ways to diagnose, prevent, treat, and possibly cure th ese 
conditions. IC/PBS, CP/CPPS, vulvodynia, and IBS are especially challenging pain conditions because their 
cause(s) are unknown, and fully effective treatments remain elusive.  
NIDDK  supports  studies  to address  chronic  pelvic  pain  of urologic  and GI origin,  including  the 
Multidisciplinary  Approach  to the Study  of Chronic  Pelvic  Pain  (MAPP)  Research  Network.  This NIDDK -
led network includes multiple centers to  conduct  innovative, collaborative studies of IC/PBS and 
CP/CPPS that include searching “beyond  the bladder/prostate” to find the causes of these conditions 
 161 and includes studies of the possible relationships between these conditions and other chronic pain 
disorders (such as IBS and fibromyalgia).226 
Co-funded  by ORWH,  NIDDK  leads  the Interdisciplinary  Research  on Interstitial  Cystitis/Painful  Bladder  
Syndrome  (IC/PBS)  initiative to support interdisciplinary research teams to address critical research 
questions focused on IC/PBS, with translational or clinical relevance. One team is exploring the possible 
role of the GI and/or reproductive tract microbiomes in IC/PBS,227 the other is studying whether women 
with IC/PBS have global pain hypersensitivity.228 
The Women’s  Health  and Functional  Visceral  Disorders  Center  is studying the interplay between gut and 
brain pathways in IC/PBS and IBS, focusing on sex differences in the development, clinical manifestation, 
and treatment response in these pain syndromes. This interdisciplinary Specialized Center of Research -
(SCOR ) on Sex and Gender Factors Affecting W omen’s Health was established through an ORWH 
program and is co -funded by NIDDK and ORWH.229NIDDK  is supporting  the Rand  IC Epidemiology  (RICE)  
study  and other large studies to answer fundamental questions about prevalence, potential causes, and 
risk factors  of IC/PBS, and to learn more about the broader impact of this condition on health and 
quality of life.230 The RICE study found through a nationwide telephone -based survey that 2.7 to 6.7 
percent of adult women in the U.S. have symptoms consistent with IC/PB S.231 The RICE study has also 
revealed a very high prevalence of sexual dysfunction among women with IC/PBS symptoms,232 as well 
as high rates of depressive symptoms and panic disorder.233 In addition to helping establish the public 
health burden, this informati on is important to the design of future clinical trials and epidemiological 
studies that can benefit people with IC/PBS.  
NIDDK  supports  fundamental  studies  of the bladder  and prostate  in health  and disease , including studies 
of structure, function, and inn ervation, as well as studies of the possible role of infectious agents in 
triggering urologic pain.  NIDDK also supports  fundamental  studies  of GI innervation,  motility,  and 
bacterial  complement  that could provide insight into why and how IBS develops.  
The NICHD -led Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN) is a highly productive clinical trials network that 
conducts research on how to improve the care and daily lives of women with pelvic organ prolapse and 
bladder and bowel control problems.

clinical features associated with successful treatment response.  
NICHD  funds  the Prostaglandin  E2 Signaling  in Growth  and Pains  of Endometriosis  study, co -funded by

prevent disease progression.  
NIH also sponsors  conferences  to stimulate  innovative  research  and encourage  collaboration  on pelvic  
pain  disorders . On July 11 –12, 2011, NICHD and ORWH co -sponsored the conference Vulvodynia:  A 
Chronic  Pain  Condition —Setting  a Research  Agenda  in Potomac, Maryland.234 In November 2010, NICHD, 
ORWH, other NIH Institutes and Centers, and other federal Agencies sponsored Advances  in Uterine  
Leiomyoma  Research:  Third  NIH International  Congress . 
Brain  function  and anatomy  in chronic  prostatitis/chronic  pelvic  pain  syndrome  (CP/CPPS)  was revealed  
through  fMRI.  Results of this study show an association between functional and anatomical changes in 
the brains of men with CP/CPPS compared to those with out this condition. Future studies will determine 
whether the observed brain changes are a result of chronic pelvic pain or represent risk factors for the 
development of CP/CPPS.235 
Research on pelvic pain associated with UTIs has implicated bacterial LPS236 in inciting pain through a 
novel mechanism involving host TLR4 receptors. This line of research is being explored by chronic 
urologic pelvic pain researchers as it also suggests that there may be an infectious origin in the 
persistent, chronic pain experien ced by people with IC/PBS and CP/CPPS, and could yield new 
therapeutic strategies.237  
 A recent study in over 100 participants found that a cognitive behavioral therapy protocol for the 
treatment of IBS which directly targets visceral sensations may be part icularly effective for this 
condition, compared to other CBT approaches not specifically focused on these sensations.238  
Endometriosis occurs when tissues that usually grow inside the uterus instead grow on the outside, such 
as on the surfaces of organs in the pelvis or abdomen. Endometriosis may cause infertility or pelvic pain 
and affects an estimated 8 –10 percent of reproductive age women. The pain of endometriosis can be 
chronic or cyclical. Researchers surveyed women enrolled in an endometriosis researc h program registry 
in Puerto Rico to study the burden of disease from a patient perspective. The majority of survey 
respondents indicated that their pain interfered with daily activities, such as household chores, sexual

 163 relations, sleep, exercise, and soc ial activities. About 66 percent reported that their pain interfered with 
work. Most perceived a decrease in the quality of their work when suffering from endometriosis -related 
pain, and almost 20 percent reported being unable to work due to pain. Responde nts who missed work 
due to pain were absent an average of 2.8 days per month. Among all respondents, endometriosis 
resulted in an average of 19.3 days of work missed per year. Thus, for women with moderate to severe 
cases, the burden of endometriosis signi ficantly impacts quality of life across home, work, and social 
domains. It can interfere with work performance and lead to significant absenteeism. These effects are 
costly to not only the patients, but also to the medical system and employers.239  
Uterine f ibroids, also called leiomyomas, are non -cancerous growths that occur in the wall of the uterus. 
They may cause painful menstrual periods, heavy bleeding, pain during sexual intercourse, infertility, 
anemia, and fatigue. One study estimated that one of fou r American women —and up to three of four 
African -American women —have uterine fibroids that cause problematic symptoms. Although scientists 
know that the female hormones estrogen and progesterone play a role in the growth of fibroids, they 
have been unable to determine what causes uterine fibroids to develop. Treatment options are limited 
to hormone therapy and surgery. However, hormone therapies used to treat fibroid tumors do not 
always produce much improvement and only temporarily relieve symptoms. Even i f fibroids are 
surgically removed, they may return, or their removal may result in the formation of painful scar tissue. 
The only sure way to prevent fibroids from returning is to remove the uterus, which is not an option for 
women who want to have childre n in the future.  
Researchers are investigating new treatments for fibroids with the hope of finding an option that will 
provide long -term relief without compromising fertility. One possibility is a form of gene therapy that 
affects estrogen receptors. A re cent study examined the safety and efficacy of this gene therapy in rats 
with uterine fibroids. Researchers randomized the rats to a fibroid gene therapy condition, an alternate 
gene therapy unrelated to fibroids, and a no treatment condition. Results reve aled that the fibroid gene 
therapy shrunk fibroids by 45 percent at day 8 following the treatment and 80 percent at day 15. 
Treatment effects remained significant at day 30, with a 77 percent decrease in fibroid size compared to 
pretreatment size. In contr ast, the two control groups saw fibroids double in size over the course of 30 
days.  
The gene therapy treatment was not only effective, it was safe. Tests revealed no damage to uterine 
tissue surrounding the fibroids or changes in liver function that might suggest toxicity. In most cases, the 
gene therapy did not appear to spread beyond the uterus, although some of the treated rats did show 
faint traces in the liver. This study provides preclinical data to support the development of gene therapy 
as an altern ative to surgical and hormonal treatments of uterine fibroids.240 NINR also developed a 
palliative care brochure, "Palliative Care: The Relief You Need When You're Experiencing the Symptoms 
of Serious Illness," to increase awareness of the many benefits of t his comprehensive treatment among 
patient and caregiving populations, the general public, the media, and health care providers. The

NIH will continue to pursue research avenues to alleviate the burden of chronic pelvic pain. NIDDK will 
maintain multidisciplinary research efforts to uncover the causes and contributors to IC/PBS, CP/CPPS, 
and IBS, and to develop prevention and treatment strategies. Current efforts should provide a 
foundation for improved methods to determine prevalence and identify affected individuals, and for the 
development and testing of new therapeutic  strategies. The Institute will continue to collaborate and 
consult on new opportunities with NICHD and ORWH, and with members of the NIH Pain Consortium.  
Obesity  
Obesity242 is a major contributor to serious health conditions in children and adults. Individuals who are 
obese have increased risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, many forms of cancer, 
osteoarthritis, liver disease, gallbladder disease, urinary inconti nence, sleep disordered breathing, 
dementia, and many other diseases and conditions. Defined as an excess of body fat, obesity develops 
when the number of calories consumed in food and beverages exceeds the number of calories that the 
body burns to fuel ba sic life functions, physical activity, and normal growth during childhood.  A complex 
interplay of factors influences obesity, from genetics and other aspects of our biology to chemical 
exposures and a range of other environmental factors  to psychological and behavioral factors .  
Given the alarming rate of increase in obesity, NIH invests significantly in  a broad portfolio of basic, 
clinical, and translational research to: 1) understand the complex factors that regulate body weight and 
that contribute to obe sity, 2) test obesity prevention and treatment strategies for children and adults, 
and 3) build the evidence base to inform local and national policies. Many studies include 
racially/ethnically -diverse and socioeconomically -disadvantaged populations and po pulations in 
geographic areas burdened by obesity.  
Basic research in obesity looks at numerous risk factors that may predispose an individual towards 
obesity.  Factors currently under investigation include genetic contributions; the role of gut microbes and  
how these microbes may be affected by different diets; circadian desynchronizations such as sleep 
deficiency; the role of different types of fat tissue, such as brown fat; developmental exposure to a 
variety of environmental chemicals, such as arsenic and  bispenol A; sex differences, as related to sleep, 
reproductive health, sex hormones, pregnancy , etc. ; psychosocial and behavioral factors such as the role 
of social settings on food consumption; and environmental factors such as research on the effect of 
policies on food choices and how nutritional information and costs of health and unhealthy foods affect 
purchasing patterns.  
Findings in basic research indicat e potential new approaches toward combatting this rising epidemic.  
For example, studies have show n that high maternal glucose during pregnancy correlates with obesity 
risk in children, suggesting a potential avenue for intervention.  Scientists have also found  that disruption

242 An adult is considered to be obese when their body mass index exceeds 30 kg/m2. 
 165 of circadian rhythms can lead to fat accumulation in the liver, increasing vu lnerability to diabetes, 
obesity, and other metabolic problems.  
Translational research in obesity capitalizes on these advances to provide new directions in preventing 
and treating obesity.  For example, s cientists have discovered a way to make white fat  (common, 
subcutaneous fat)  mimic the energy -burning properties of brown fat and muscle in rats.243 Depletion of 
the neurotransmitter Neuropeptide Y in the brain  resulted in active brown fat development and reduced 
body weight in rats , as well as protection from insulin resistance normally associated with a high fat 
diet.244 In another study, researchers demonstrated that blockade of a specific receptor of 
endocannabinoids  (chemicals that affect many processes, such as pain, memory, apetite, etc.) can lead 
to w eight loss and reduced cardiovascular and metabolic risks in obese mice as well as in overweight or 
obese humans . However, this blockade  may also result in negative psychiatric side effects due to 
blockade of these receptors in the brain. A novel receptor inhibitor that does not cross the blood -brain 
barrier was developed and tested in a mouse model of obesity , resulting in weight loss and other 
beneficial metabolic changes . Results suggest this class of receptor inhibitors may be effective for 
treatment of  fatty liver disease due to obesity or heavy alcohol use.245 
NIH invests significantly in clinical and postclinical research to address current obesity.  Several  of the 
intervention strategies being investigated focus on behavioral and environmental changes t o foster 
healthier eating and physical activity , based in a variety of contexts , such as the home, schools, 
healthcare, and other community settings. Other strategies under study include medical or surgical 
interventions.   
NIH-funded researchers are examin ing the benefits of lifestyle interventions for adults delivered in a 
variety of places , including community settings such as the YMCA, primary care clinics, faith -based sites, 
the workplace, and the internet.  Study populations are drawn from urban and rur al areas, may 
encompass state -wide populations, are sometimes gender specific, and include diverse race/ethnic 
groups.   
Such studies are showing significant benefits.  For example, researchers funded through NHBLI’s 
Practice -Based Opportunity for Promotion of Weight Reduction program demonstrated that o bese 
adults who received weight loss coaching via phone, online, and email contact, as well as support from 
their primary care providers, lost a significant amount of w eight —5 percent or more of their starting 
body weight —and kept it off for two years.246 In another study, l ifestyle counseling sessions combined 
with the option to use weight loss medication or meal replacements, such as liquid shakes or meal bars, 
helped ab out one -third of obese participants lose a significant amount of weight and keep it off for two 
years.247

 166 The long -term effects of bariatric surgery are being examined through NIDDK’s multi -center Longitudinal 
Assessment of Bariatric Surgery study.  Scientis ts have recently  found that gastric bypass surgery affects 
brain activation and reduces the desire to eat, particularly high -calorie foods.248 
Many NIH ICs are investing in research to address the alarming rise of obesity in children and youth.  Led 
by NCI with participation by many  other ICs, The National  Collaborative  on Childhood Obesity Research  
(NCCOR ) is a joint effort  of NIH, CDC, USDA, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, with the goal of 
improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and app lication of childhood obesity research through enhanced 
coordination and collaboration. In 2011, NCCOR launched new online resources for researchers: the 
Catalogue of Surveillance Systems, which includes surveillance systems relevant to childhood obesity 
research and the evaluation of policy and environmental interventions, and the Measures Registry, a 
database of measures related to diet and physical activity.  
Several ongoing  trials seek to prevent or treat childhood obesity.  For example , NIDDK and other ICs 
funded a new set of studies of lifestyle interventions ( “LIFE -Moms” ) for overweight and obese pregnant 
women, designed to improve weight and metabolic outcomes for the women and their children.  Four 
randomized trials are testing interventions to prevent excess weight gain in non -overweight youth and 
in those already overweight, and/or to reduce weight in obese and severely obese youth by targeting 
preschoolers, pre -adolescents, or adolescents. Other intervention strategies that focus on parents are  
also being explored , such as a n intensive, family -based lifestyle intervention  program for ethnically 
diverse children  that was shown to  result in  sustained reductions in body weight and indicators of 
increased diabetes risk.249  
A number of trials are addressing school -based interventions.  For example, the NIDDK -supported 
HEALTHY study showed that an intervention in middle schools lowered the obesity rate in students at 
highest risk for type 2 diabetes (those who started out overweight or obese in sixth grade ). However, 
schools that implemented the program did not differ from comparison schools in the overall prevalence 
of overweight/obesity.250 
Researchers are examining community -level interventions.  For e xample, t he NHLBI -led Healthy 
Communities Study examines 275 communities and almost 24,000 children, ages 3 –15, to identify 
characteristics of existing obesity -related community programs and policies that are associated with less 
childhood obesity and bett er eating and physical activity behaviors. NHLBI support s trials among 
American Indians and Alaska Natives to test community -responsive interventions to reduce childhood 
obesity and/or improve eating and activity behaviors in children.  
For older children and young adults, t he Early Adult Reduction of Weight through Lifestyle intervention 
study includes six  trials, led by NHLBI and including NICHD, that are testing behavioral approaches for 
weight control in young adults 18 –35 years of age at high risk for weight gain, including pregnant and 
postpartum women, community college or university students, and young adults trying to quit smoking.

 167 Interventions are delivered using technologies such as smart phones, social networking sites, Bluetooth -
enabled scales,  and text messages.  
Finally, multiple efforts are underway to communicate evidence -based approaches towards preventing 
and treating obesity. NHLBI, in collaboration with NIDDK, is updating the  Clinical Guidelines on the 
Identification, Evaluation, and Trea tment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults: Expert Panel Report .251 
The panel is using a rigorous evidence -based approach and innovative information technology to 
identify, review, and evaluate the scientific evidence for specific research questions. Public o utreach 
efforts include We Can! (Ways  to Enhance  Children’s  Activity and Nutrition) , a national public education 
outreach program to promote a healthy weight among children through efforts to improve food choices, 
increase physical activity, and reduce screen time. We Can!  is managed by NHLBI with collaboration 
from NIDDK, NICHD, and NCI.  
NIH is collaborating with Home Box Office (HBO) on its Obesity Project, titled The Weight of the Nation, 
which was aired beginning in 2012. NIH staff has been providing sc ientific input to HBO on this project 
for several years. The CDC and Institute of Me dicine (IOM) are also involved, with the IOM leading the 
coordination of the government partners. The multi -part documentary series will include four shows for 
adults, three shows for children (HBO family series), and supplemental films that will be posted  on the 
HBO Web site. The project is funded with support from Kaiser Permanente and the Michael & Susan Dell 
Foundation.   
NIH research on obesity is guided by t he NIH Obesity Research Task Force . In 2011, the Task Force  
developed a new, updated  Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research , with extensive external input , 
framed around the following overarching themes:  
 Discover fundamental biologic processes that regulate body weight and influence behavior  
 Understand the factors that contribute to obesity and its  consequences  
 Design and test new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight  
 Evaluate promising strategies for obesity prevention and treatment in real -world settings and 
diverse populations  
 Harness technology and tools to advance obesity  research and improve health care delivery  
 Facilitate integration of research results into community programs and medical practice

 168 Allergy and Asthma  
Allergic diseases, including asthma, currently are a major cause of illness and disability in the U .S. NIAID 
supports studies of the cause, pathogenesis, course of disease, and diagnosis of allergic diseases and 
evaluates new approaches to treat and prevent them.  
Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Asthma causes recurrin g 
periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and 
coughing .252 The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning.  NIAID supports targeted 
research to understand the causes of and develop preventions and treatments for asthma, a respiratory 
disease that affects almost 25 million Americans, including 7 million children aged 17 years and under. 
NIAID's research focuses on understanding how the environment, allergens, and genetics interact wit h 
the body's immune system to cause the disease and aggravate the symptoms.   
Among recent advances, a NIAID -supported clinical trial showed that adding the antibody omalizumab, 
to the  NIH guideline -based asthma treatment regimen of inner -city children sign ificantly reduced their 
asthma symptoms and nearly eliminated seasonal asthma exacerbations. The study is being conducted 
through the NIH Inner -City Asthma Consortium launched in 2002 and is now composed of 10 academic 
clinical centers. The Consortium  evaluates the safety and efficacy of promising immune -based therapies 
to reduce asthma severity and prevent disease onset in inner -city children. The Consortium also pursues 
studies to understand mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of asthma an d research to 
develop diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.  
Food allergy is an abnormal response to a food, triggered by the body’s immune system . The response 
may be mild, or in rare cases it can be associated with the severe and life -threatening reactio n called 
anaphylaxis.  NIAID is the lead Institute at NIH for research in food allergy  and supports research to help 
better understand, prevent, and manage this disorder that affects approximately 5 percent of children 
and 4 percent of adults in the United States. Since 2003, NIAID has substantially increased its support for 
food allergy research, which now spans the spectrum from basic research in allergy and immunology to 
clinical trials that are testing new strategies to treat and prevent food allergy  
In recent years, concerns have mounted over the rise in prevalence of food allergy in children and 
adults. Currently, the only strategies to  combat the condition are to avoid the particular food and treat 
the symptoms as they occur. In response to these concerns, NIAID collaborated with more than 30 
professional organizations, feder al agencies, and patient advocacy groups to develop clinical guidel ines 
for use in the U.S. The guidelines will help healthcare professionals diagnose and manage non -life-
threatening food allergies as well as anaphylaxis and other  acute and potentially life -threatening food -
allergy reactions. NIAID also supports developme nt of approaches to treat or prevent food  allergies . For 
example, an oral immunotherapy trial found that egg could be introduced safely into the diets of 75 
percent of egg -allergic children.

 169 Digestive Diseases  
Digestive diseases span a wide spectrum of diseases and disorders that affect the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, many forms of which are chronic. Some digestive diseases are 
common, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (G ERD), while others are quite rare, such as genetic 
forms of liver disease. However, collectively they exact a significant toll on public health in terms of 
quality of life, years of life lost due to premature death, and costs associated with hospitalizatio ns and 
pharmaceutical and surgical interventions. Additional information on some chronic digestive conditions 
and diseases is included in other sections of this report (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome under Chronic 
Pelvic Pain, inflammatory bowel diseases a nd celiac disease under Autoimmune Diseases, cancers of 
digestive system under Cancer, and viral hepatitis under Infectious Diseases and Biodefense).  
To reduce the public health burden of digestive diseases, NIH -supported scientists are vigorously 
pursuing research to better understand how widespread these diseases are across the U.S. and in 
specific population groups, to identify the causes of diseases  and how they progress, and to test new 
interventions for prevention and treatment of these costly diseases, including drugs, surgery, and 
behavior modification. Major supporters of digestive diseases research at NIH include NIDDK, as well as 
NCI and NIAID .  
In addition to its extensive portfolio supporting individual investigators advancing digestive diseases 
research, NIDDK also supports multi -center research efforts such as the Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
Genetics Consortium, Gastroparesis Clinical Resear ch Consortium, Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical 
Research Network, Childhood Liver Disease Research Network, Drug -Induced Liver Injury Network, adult 
and pediatric Acute Liver Failure Study Groups, and Hepatitis B Research Network, as well as 21 
Digest ive Diseases Research Centers located across the country. The Institute also supports follow -up 
and ancillary studies to completed clinical trials in such areas as hepatitis C and adult -to-adult living 
donor liver transplantation.  
Recent advances promise n ew approaches for treating and preventing these pervasive and debilitating 
disorders.  A group of NIDDK -sponsored scientists has develop ed a method for turning human adult stem 
cells that are pluripotent (i.e., have the capability becoming different tissue cell type ), into three -
dimensional intestinal tissue in culture. This pioneering work has the potential to open up several new 
research directions, including elucidating pathways involved in inherited intestinal conditions, testing 
new drugs for their intestinal absorption, and even generating tissue for transplantation in conditions 
such as inflammatory bowel diseases, necrotizing enterocolitis, and short -gut syndromes.253 
Researchers in NIDDK’s Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network have  shown benefits of 
vitamin E as a treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  (fatty liver disease)  in adults, as well as in 
children with the most severe form of the disease.  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common 
chronic liver disease among U .S. children.254 In other advances, NIDDK -sponsored investigators

 170 successfully implanted physiologically functional, bioengineered anal sphincters in mice, which could 
lead to the development of a treatment for fecal incontinence in humans .255 An NCCAM -support ed trial 
showed  that placebos administered with the patients’ knowledge may be an effective treatment for 
IBS.256 Researchers in the NIDDK Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium discovered evidence of 
changes at the cellular level in the stomachs of indi viduals with gastroparesis, a chronic condition 
characterized by impaired gastrointestinal motility, yielding new insights into this digestive disorder.257 
NIH, along with Federal and non -Federal partners, will continue  efforts to address goals for advancing  
digestive diseases research in the NIH -led National Commission on Digestive Diseases research plan.258 
For example, the NIDDK, together with NIAID, has established a new Intestinal Stem Cell Consortium, 
which is based on a research recommendation from the N ational Commission on Digestive Diseases’ 
research plan, to stimulate basic research on the digestive system by developing new technologies to 
isolate, characterize, cultivate, and manipulate its stem cells.  
Additionally, NIDDK is continuing support of it s current research efforts in digestive diseases, as well as 
pursuing new directions. For example, NIDDK is supporting new studies through the Hepatitis B 
Research Network to advance understanding of disease processes and to develop effective approaches 
to treatment. In 2012, the NIDDK entered into a cooperative research and development agreement 
(CRADA) with a pharmaceutical company to begin a clinical trial testing the safety and potential efficacy 
of a new treatment —cysteamine bitartrate —for nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis (NASH) in children through 
the NASH Clinical Research Network.259 The NIDDK also launched a Bowel Control Awareness Campaign 
to help patient and healthcare professionals feel more comfortable talking about conditions such as 
fecal incontinen ce.260 
Kidney Diseases  
Normal, healthy kidneys filter about 200 quarts of blood each day, generating about two quarts of 
excess fluid, salts, and waste products that are excreted as urine. Loss of function of these organs, due 
to a variety of causes, can result in life -threatening complications. In people with polycystic kidney 
disease, fluid -filled cysts form in the kidneys and other organs and can, as they grow over time, 
compromise kidney function. There is no treatment that can restore kidney function once it has been 
lost; patients require either dialysis or a transplant to survive.   
NIH’s basic and clinical research on kidney development and disease include  research on t he causes of 
kidney disease , the underlying mechanisms leading to progression of k idney disease to end-stage renal 
disease  that requires replacement of kidney function through dialysis or transplantation, and the

 171 identification and testing of possible treatments to prevent development or halt progression of kidney 
disease.  As the lead N IH IC for kidney disease, NIDDK support s studies of inherited diseases , such as 
polycystic kidney disease, congenital kidney disorders, and immune -related kidney diseases , including  
IgA nephropathy and hemolytic uremic syndrome.  Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS ) is a cause 
of nephrotic syndrome  in children and adolescents, as well as an important cause of  kidney failure  in 
adults and accounts for about a sixth of the cases of  nephrotic syndrome . 
NIDDK -supported clinical trials are exploring new treatment options and identify ing novel links between 
kidney disease and  its many co -morbid conditions, including cardiovascular disease.  For example, NIDDK 
and NHLBI are co -sponsoring the Co-sponsored by NIDDK and NHLBI, the Chronic Renal In sufficiency 
Cohort Study261 is evaluating long -term cardiovascular risk and outcomes of over 3,700 persons with 
chronic kidney disease. In a recent finding, scientists reported that high levels of FGF -23, a hormone that 
regulates phosphate metabolism, are associated with an increased risk of kidney failure and death 
among people with chronic kidney disease. This study is part of a broader effort by NIH to identify 
biomarkers that can allow physicians to better predict how various diseases are likely to prog ress in 
different patients and thereby personalize treatments to improve their health.262  
The Chronic Kidney Disease in Children  Study263 examines  over 500 children with mild to moderately 
decreased kidney function in order to  identify  risk factors for further decrease in kidney function; closely 
monitor brain development; examine risk factors for heart disease; and look at the long -term effects of 
poor growth in this group.264 265 In order to identify and validate biomarkers, which should stimulate 
bench to  bedside translation and may enhance researchers’ ability to evaluate promising new therapies 
in clinical trials , NIDDK supports the Chronic Kidney Disease Biomarker Consortium . NIDDK is also 
studying a cute kidney injury (also called acute renal failure) , which  is a relatively common complication 
in hospitalized patients.  The Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae in Acute Kidney 
Injury , a study of the natural history of patients with acute kidney injury, will provide important 
information a bout the natural history of acute kidney injury and recovery.266  
NIA collaborates  with  NIDDK to support research on renal function and chronic kidney disease in aging . 
Projects include  basic, clinical, and translational research on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its 
consequences in aging and in older persons , focusing on  biology and pathophysiology of CKD in animal 
models; etiology and pathophysiology of CKD in the elderly; epidemiology and risk factors for the

 172 development of CKD with advancing age; and/ or diagnosis, medical management and clinical outcomes 
of CKD in this population.267  
NIAID, along with NHLBI and NIDDK, supports the  Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation  
program268 which aims to enhance the understanding of, and ultimately reduce the immu ne-mediated 
morbidity and mortality of organ transplantation, including kidney transplantation.  NIAID and NH LBI also 
fund the Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation in Children ,269 which aims to improve short - and long -
term graft and patient survival in children who have undergone heart, lung, and kidney transplantation.  
The Immune Tolerance Network270, a clinical research consortium sponsored by NIAID,  is dedicated to 
the clinical ev aluation of novel therapies that are designed to promote immune system tolerance in 
autoimmune and allergic diseases, and therefore, prevent rejection of transplanted tissues, cells, and 
organs (including kidney).   
NCI and NIDDK researchers are collaborati ng in research regarding focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 
(FSGS) , the leading cause of primary nephrotic syndrome in adults and the leading cause of end -stage 
renal disease in children, as well as HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) , a disorder that occur s in 10 
percent of untreated HIV -infected  persons of African descent but is rarely observed in non -Africans.   
Previous studies have found that African Americans with two variant s of the  APOL1  gene have about a 4 
percent lifetime risk of developing FSGS. These findings explain nearly all of the excess risk of non -
diabetic kidney failure in African Americans. 271 Recently, APOL1  variants have been shown in 
experiments to destroy trypanosomes that carry African sleeping sickness, a degenerative and 
potentially  fatal disease affecting tens of thousands of people in sub -Saharan Africa.272 In another study, 
the cellular distribution of APOL1  was observed to differ in samples taken from normal kidneys 
compared to samples taken from patients with FSGS or HIV -associate d kidney disease, most notably in a 
subset of smooth muscle cells that surround the arteries leading to the glomerulus. This observation 
suggests that a previously unrecognized problem with blood vessels may play an important role in 
kidney disease.273  
In a clinical trial to treat FSGS in children and young adults , researchers  found no difference between 
two different drug regimens to treat this form of kidney disease, which is stubbornly resistant to 
standard therapy. The trial was the largest clinical tria l of pediatric and adult patients with steroid -
resistant FSGS. The results of this investigation underscore the importance of continued research to 
identify new markers of disease progression (biomarkers) and other factors that contribute to this 
disease, which may provide new targets for therapy and allow physicians to more closely monitor a

 173 patient’s response to treatment.274 Scientists have identified a factor circulating in the blood of some 
patients with FSGS that may play an important role in the disease’s initiation, progression, and 
recurrence. Levels of serum -soluble urokinase receptor were found to correlate with risk of FSGS and 
risk of recurrent FSGS following a kidney transplant. This discovery, once replicated by others, may have 
important implications both for research and for decisions regarding patient care.275 
The Renin -Angiotensin -Aldosterone System (RAAS)  is an endocrine system housed in the kidney  and also 
expressed in other organs, including the heart and brain. RAAS plays an important  role in the control of 
blood pressure (BP) and renal function. The first rat gene knockout model of RAAS was generated using 
a new technology called zinc -finger nucleases (ZFNs). The Ren -/- rat showed a greatly reduced blood 
pressure, having no plasma ren in activity and no renin protein expressed in the juxtaglomerular cells in 
the kidney. Th e creation of a knockout rat  will permit significant mechanistic research in this important 
system.276 
In regard to public health information campaigns,  NIDDK’s  National  Kidney Disease Education Program 
(NKDEP)277 raises awareness about the problem of kidney disease and steps such as control of diabetes 
or high blood pressure that should be taken to treat chronic kidney disease and prevent kidney failure.  
NIDDK will contin ue its multi -faceted approach to research into kidney diseases, including:  
 The continued fostering of basic research into the underlying biology of both normal kidney 
function and the mechanisms of disease initiation and progression.  
 Clinical trials  to explore novel treatment approaches for a wide variety of kidney diseases, as 
well as attempts to stabilize or reverse kidney disease in patients.  
 Translational research to explore how best to move advances from the bench to the bedside, 
and from the bedsi de into clinical practice.  
 Education and outreach campaigns to spread the evidence -based information about how people 
can prevent kidney disease and preserve kidney function.  
Urologic Diseases and Conditions  
Diseases and conditions affecting the bladder an d associated structures of the lower urinary tract affect 
people of all ages, result in significant health care expenditures, and may lead to substantial disability 
and impaired quality of life. Women are disproportionately affected by many urologic diseas es and 
conditions, such as urinary incontinence, urinary tract infections ( UTIs ), and interstitial cystitis/painful 
bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) (see “Chronic Pelvic Pain”). A conservative estimate is that approximately 13

 174 million Americans, most of them women, suffer from urinary incontinence. 278 UTIs are among the most 
common infectious  diseases acquired by humans; in fact, only respiratory infections occur more often. 
UTIs caused by the bacterium Escherichia coli  (E. coli , which is normally found in the colon) accounted 
for over 8 million doctor visits, nearly 7 million by women, in 200 0, and many women suffer from 
frequent infections.279 In men, non -cancerous growth of the prostate, or benign prostatic hyperplasia 
(BPH), is a common cause of bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms, such as weak or intermittent 
urine stream, an inability t o empty the bladder completely, and having to urinate frequently, especially 
at night. The prevalence of BPH increases from 40 to 50 percent in men ages 51 to 60 to greater than 80 
percent in men older than 80.280 Congenital malformations or obstructions of the urinary tract can lead 
to a variety of urologic problems in children, including reflux of urine back toward the kidneys 
(vesicoureteral reflux) and UTIs. Urologic diseases and disorders can also contribute to or be the primary 
cause of sexual dysfuncti on. As people age, many non -cancerous urologic conditions become more 
prevalent. Thus, addressing the burden of urologic diseases and conditions is an important challenge to 
meet as the American population ages overall.  
Spearheaded by NIDDK, NIH supports basic and clinical research on the normal and abnormal 
development, structure, function, and injury repair of the genitourinary tract. Areas of particular 
interest include the causes of and treatments for major adult urological diseases and disorders, such  as 
BPH, urinary incontinence and UTIs. (Other disorders of the genitourinary tract, such as IC/PBS and 
chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, are discussed under “Chronic Pelvic Pain.”) Additional 
areas of interest include research on treatment s for kidney stones ( hard masses developed from crystals 
that separate from the urine within the urinary tract), such as shock -wave and laser lithotripsy to break 
up stones, and therapeutic approaches to inhibit their formation and growth.  
NIH e fforts inc lude  the GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project , an NIDDK -funded 
consortium of laboratories working to provide the scientific and medical community with tools to 
facilitate research on the genitourinary tract.281 With co -funding from ORWH, NIDDK  also supports the 
Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network  thatinvestigate s surgical, behavioral, and medical treatments 
for stress and urge urinary incontinen ce.282 One study  in this network  has revealed that two common 
operations for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) help women achieve similar levels of dryness. The Trial 
of Mid -Urethral Slings  compared the outcomes of two minimally invasive surgical procedures involving 
use of synthetic mes h slings that are FDA -approved to treat this condition in women. Importantly, the 
trial also captured the risks and side effects of each type of surgery, which differed. Having this

available treatment options.283  
The NIDDK -supported multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Randomized 
Intervention for Vesicoureteral Reflux trial is designed to determine whet her daily antimicrobial 
prophylaxis is  superior to placebo in preventing recurrence of UTI in children with vesicoureteral 
reflux.284 
NIDDK and other ICs support b asic and clinical research on UTIs  to elucidate the cause(s) and illuminate 
potential treatment approaches for acute and recurrent UTIs. For example, scientists at a Specialized 
Center of Research co -supported by NIDDK and ORWH have made tremendous progress in 
understanding factors in both the host organism (e.g., human or mouse) and the infecting bacteria that 
contribute to the onset and recurrence of UTIs.  
An NIDDK -supported effort, Urologic Diseases in America (UDA)  incorporates current and retrospective 
data on all aspects of the epidemiology, practice patterns, costs, and imp act of urologic diseases in the 
United States. The UDA compendium delineates the changes in these areas over a ten -year period. In 
addition to updating the original 2007 compendium, the second phase of the UDA has focused less on 
descriptive analyses and m ore on analytical outcomes analyses, and attempted to increase involvement 
of the urologic community in analytical activities. The UDA is intended for use by public officials, 
nongovernment organizations, the media, academic researchers, health professiona ls, and the public.285 
Results from the Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Urological Symptoms  multi -center clinical 
trial, co -funded by NIDDK, NCCAM, and ODS, has found that the commonly used herbal dietary 
supplement saw palmetto does not improve B PH-related symptoms even at high doses —information 
that men with these symptoms and their health care providers can use in discussing and making choices 
about conventional and alternative therapies for symptom relief.286  
Possessing a specific chemical coat called a K1 capsule appears to be a requirement for infectious 
bacteria to grow and form large masses called intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) within the 
urinary tract of mice. Prior studies in rodent models indicated that formation of these IBCs helps 
promote sustained infection and may help explain at least some recurrent UTIs. By identifying the 
bacterial capsule as a factor that contributes to IBC formation, researchers have now illuminated targets 
for potential novel therapeutic interventions to prevent or treat UTIs. As IBCs have been observed in 
human bladder infections, these results likely have direct clinical implications.287  
Kidney stones are among the most painful and most common urologic disorders. Scientists have 
uncovered new insights into how one particular type of kidney stone forms and grows, including a

that accounts for approximately 3 million visits to health care providers eac h year.288  
Priority research areas identified by NIH include:  
 Improving women’s urologic health, including promoting the development of alternatives to 
antibiotic treatment for UTIs and finding new ways to prevent or treat urinary incontinence.  
 Improving me n’s urologic health, including finding new ways to treat BPH and other diseases of 
the prostate.  
 Attaining a better understanding of both the causes of lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) 
and how treatments for LUTD symptoms intersect with patient repo rted outcomes and 
expectations so that treatments can be improved.  
 Strengthening the pipeline  of urologic research and researchers to ensure a next generation of 
effective treatment strategies for urologic diseases and conditions.  
Diabetes  
Type 1  Diabetes  
Type  1 diabetes  is an autoimmune  disease  that often  strikes  in infancy,  childhood,  or young  adulthood.  
The NIDDK’s  landmark  Diabetes  Control  and Complications  Trial  (DCCT),  conducted  from  1983  to 1993,  
showed  that intensive  glucose  control  dramatically  delays or prevents  the eye,  nerve,  and kidney  
complications  of type  1 diabetes.  A paradigm shift in the way type 1 diabetes is controlled was based on 
this finding. The follow -on study (Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study, 
EDIC) sh owed that tight glucose control also prevents or delays the cardiovascular complications of type 
1 diabetes. Because  of improvements  in treatment  of the disease  and new  technologies,  the long -term  
survival  of those  with  type 1 diabetes has dramatically  improved  in the last 30 years.  However, disease 
management to reduce risk for complications places an enormous burden on patients. Thus, it is 
imperative to pursue research on new methods, such as artificial pancreas technology, to improve type  
1 diabetes  control and reduce the burden on patients. Major efforts to address type  1 diabetes —in 
particular those on diabetes complications and beta cell research, as well as hemoglobin A1c 
standardization —are also of great importance for reducing the burden of type 2 diabetes . 
The incidence  of type 1 diabetes  is increasing  at three  percent  per year,  suggesting  that one or more  
unknown  environmental  factor  is involved  in triggering  the disease.  Type 1 diabetes  is one of the few 
polygenic  diseases  for which  over  70 percent  of the genetic  basis  of the disease  has been  identified.  
With the identification of additional risk genes and biomarkers, it is now possible to predict risk of 
developing type 1 diabetes. This has enabled the launch of prevention studies as well as studies to 
identify environmental trigger(s). Artificial  pancreas  technology —linking  a continuous  blood  glucose

 177 sensor  and an insulin  delivery  system —has high  potential  to have  a positive  impact  on patients’  health  
and quality  of life.  
Current research on  type 1 diabetes  supports the following broad goals: 1) identify the genetic and 
environmental causes; 2) prevent or reverse the disease; 3) develop cell replacement therapy; 4) 
improve type 1 diabetes  management and care (including development of the arti ficial pancreas); and 5) 
prevent or reduce the complications of the disease. Type 1 diabetes research at NIH is supported by 
regular appropriations and by the Special Statutory Funding Program for Type 1 Diabetes Research , a 
program administered by the NID DK on behalf of the HHS Secretary and in collaboration with other NIH 
ICs.  
Major research efforts include  the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet , an NIDDK -led international clinical trials 
network that screens large numbers  of individuals and conducts trials of agents to prevent type 1 
diabetes  in at -risk people and to slow progression of the disease in people who are newly diagnosed. 
Blood tests can accurately identify relatives of people with type 1 diabetes  who are at high  or moderate 
risk of developing the disease within five years. This has enabled  TrialNet  to launch clinical trials of 
promising prevention strategies, two of which (oral insulin, anti -CD3) are currently ongoing.289 Recent  
results from three clinical trials t esting agents targeting the immune system in people with new -onset 
type 1 diabetes  reported that : 
The drug abatacept slowed disease progression for 6 –9 months compared to placebo.  After that time, 
the effect of the drug diminished, and rate of loss of insulin production was similar in the abatacept and 
placebo groups. However, because of the initial beneficial effects, after two years, people in the 
abatacept group produced 59 perce nt more C -peptide, a marker of insulin production.290 Preservation of 
C-peptide production is associated with better glucose control, less hypoglycemia, and reduced risk of 
complications. Another study showed that a Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD) vaccine had no effect 
after one year.291 In type 1 diabetes, GAD is a major target of autoimmune response.  
The drug rituximab, which destroys immune cells called B lymphocytes, preserved insulin production in 
newly diagnosed patients for 1 year, but the effect dissi pated at 2 years. As drugs such as rituximab 
broadly deplete B lymphocytes, they can increase risk of infection and therefore have significant side 
effects. Nonetheless, the finding is important because it is propelling research to find drugs targeting the  
specific B lymphocytes involved in type 1 diabetes without the associated side effects.292  
Research is showing that people with type 1 diabetes are living longer, healthier lives than ever before, 
largely due to long -term NIH supported research.  The Epidem iology of Diabetes Interventions and 
Complications (EDIC) study  demonstrated that, compared to conventional therapy, near -normal control 
of blood glucose —beginning soon after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and continuing an average of 6.5 
years —reduced the l ong-term risk (average 22 -year follow -up) of developing kidney disease by 50

 178 percent.  The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial ( DCCT ) showed reduced biomarkers of 
complications. A decade after DCCT end ed, EDIC found reduced heart attack, stroke, and ca rdiovascular 
death. Now, two decades later, EDIC found that early control reduced development of chronic and end 
stage kidney disease. This finding shows that the benefits of early  and intensive therapy can persist for 
decades. It also demonstrates the importance of long -term research, when the full benefit of treatment 
may not be seen for long time periods.293  
The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY)  is an NIDDK -led study to identify the 
infectious agents, dietary factors, or other  environmental conditions that trigger type 1 diabetes  in 
genetically susceptible individuals. The TEDDY study has completed enrollment of over 8,000 high -risk 
newborns and is collecting biosamples for analysis to identify potential triggers of type 1 diab etes . 
Children enrolled in the study are developing autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes at the predicted rates, 
indicating that those at risk can be accurately identified and that the study is on track to make a major 
contribution. Identification of an infect ious agent that triggers autoimmunity could lead to a vaccine to 
protect against type 1 diabetes , or, if dietary factors are identified that protect from or contribute to the 
development of the disease, changes to infant feeding practices could be recommen ded. NIAID, NIEHS, 
and NICHD also participate in this study.294 
The Beta Cell Biology Consortium (BCBC),  led by NIDDK,  is a consortium of researchers studying pancreas 
and beta cell biology and development toward a cell -based treatment for type 1 diabetes . BCBC 
investigators are working to reconstruct components of human type 1 diabetes  in the mouse to observe 
how human diabetes develops, and then pinpoint the molecules, genes, and cells responsible.295 
Consortium  researchers  recently discovered that pancreatic glucagon -producing alpha cells could 
convert to insulin -producing beta cells in a mouse model of diabetes. This insight suggests that it may be 
possible to develop therapies to promote conversion of alpha cells to beta cells to restore insulin 
production in people with diabetes, and opens up intriguing new avenues for research toward cell 
replacement therapy.296 
The Clinical Islet Transplantation Consortium,  co-led by NIDDK and NIAID, is conducting clinical and 
mechanistic studies in islet transpla ntation, with or without accompanying kidney transplantation, for 
the treatment of type 1 diabetes . The Consortium has completed enrollment of a pivotal (Phase III) islet 
transplantation trial (islet transplant alone), which is intended to support future F DA licensure of an islet 
product.297 
To overcome the limitations of current insulin therapy, researchers have long sought to link glucose 
monitoring and insulin delivery by developing an artificial pancreas. There has been tremendous 
progress toward the deve lopment of an artificial pancreas  that will mimic, as closely as possible, the way 
a healthy pancreas detects changes in blood glucose levels and responds automatically to secrete

 179 appropriate amounts of insulin. All of the current continuous glucose monito ring technology on the 
market benefitted from NIDDK support early in development. NICHD and NIBIB have joined NIDDK in 
supporting small -business initiatives aimed at further development of these and related technologies. 
Clinical studies on closed -loop tec hnologies are now ongoing, including a TrialNet study of whether 
initiation of closed -loop glucose control at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and subsequent continuous 
glucose monitoring can preserve insulin production in people with newly diagnosed type 1 di abetes.298 
NIDDK is also supporting research training of engineers and behavioral scientists —fields that are critical 
for propelling progress in this area.   
NICHD supports a diverse research portfolio related to type 1 diabetes  in children and in pregnant 
women. For example,  NICHD has funded research on the increased risk of pregnancy complications for 
women with type 1 diabetes; metabolic processes underlying the severity of type 1 diabetes in children; 
and behavioral research on the maintenance of glycemic control in children and adolescents and other 
areas of science.  The Diabetes Research in Children Network,  led by NICHD, is a research consortium 
investigating hypoglycemia and use of continuous glucose monitoring in children .299  
The TRIGR clinical trial,  led by NICHD , is examining whether hydrolyzed infant formula compared to 
standard cow’s milk -based formula decreases the risk of developing type 1 diabetes in at -risk children.300 
The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network  is an NEI -led, collaborative, nationwide network of 
eye doctors and investigators conducting multi -center clinical trials of diabetes -induced eye disease, 
including comparative effectiveness research on new therapies. By providing infrastructure fo r 
conducting multiple concurrent studies, DRCR.net  enables rapid development, initiation, and patient 
recruitment for new protocols and provides opportunities for industry collaborations while maintaining 
a rigorous academic environment.  
The Hemoglobin A1C  (HbA1C) Standardization Program , supported by CDC and NIDDK, is achieving 
international standardization and reliability in measurement of HbA1C, a blood test that measures 
glycosylated hemoglobin and is a good surrogate measure of long -term blood glucose control and, as 
such, reflects risk of diabetic complications.301  
NIDDK -supported research uncovered a key factor necessary for making insulin -producing beta cells in 
both humans and mice. Mice lacking the newly identified protein —called Rfx6 —can make islet s, but 
these islets do not contain insulin -producing cells. Interestingly, a rare form of neonatal diabetes is 
associated with mutations in the human gene that produces the Rfx6 protein, suggesting that Rfx6 plays 
a critical role in beta cell development i n humans as well as mice. Researchers now know they will have

 180 to ensure that Rfx6 is present in order to successfully generate beta cells from some other cell type for 
transplantation into people with diabetes.302 
Researchers funded by NIDDK tested an implan table glucose sensor that monitors tissue glucose and 
reports data to an external wireless receiver.  When implanted into pigs, the system functioned 
continuously for over a year. The implanted sensor also worked when tested for several months in 
diabetic pigs. These results are encouraging because an implantable device could potentially be used in 
the future as part of an artificial pancreas to automate glucose sensing and insulin delivery.303  
NIDDK -supported  scientists identified a novel genetic variant as sociated with type 1 diabetes risk that 
regulates a network of immune system genes.304 Understanding genetic underpinnings of the disease 
could inform new targets for therapy.  
NIDDK -supported scientists also discovered that a variant of an immune system mole cule may 
contribute to type 1 diabetes by enabling an aberrant immune reaction against insulin. 305 This discovery 
could inform ways to intervene in the immune process to prevent type 1 diabetes or slow its 
progression.  
Advances and Emerging Opportunities in  Diabetes Research: A Strategic Planning Report of the Diabetes 
Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee , published in February 2011, identifies compelling 
opportunities for research over the next decade on diabetes and its complications.  
The over 8,000  participants being followed in TEDDY provide an unparalleled resource to study the 
development of the human microbiome from birth through childhood. Planned studies will build on 
research in mice to identify how interaction between the immune system and b acteria in the gut may 
alter the risk of type 1 diabetes.   
Research will build on the unprecedented recent discoveries of genes and gene regions contributing to 
type 1 diabetes to understand their function in health and disease.  This research could illumin ate new 
targets for therapy. Research will also develop, refine, and pilot test innovative strategies to improve 
adherence to medications and medical regimens in children, adolescents, and young adults with type 1 
diabetes.  
NIDDK is supporting a new study of the Joslin “medalists” – a population of people with type 1 diabetes 
who have survived with the disease for more than 50 years without serious development of eye, kidney, 
or nerve complications. The study seeks to identif y factors that can protect against development of 
diabetes complications.

 181 Type 2  Diabetes  
In type 2 diabetes, cells in muscle, fat, and liver tissue do not properly respond to insulin. At first, the 
pancreas produces more insulin to compensate. Gradually , however, blood glucose levels rise as the 
pancreatic beta cells lose their capacity to secrete insulin, and the timing of insulin secretion becomes 
abnormal. Treatment approaches for controlling glucose levels include diet, exercise, and oral and 
injecte d medications; insulin often is required as the disease progresses. Risk factors include being 
overweight, age, racial or ethnic background, history of gestational diabetes (GDM), and family history 
of type 2 diabetes.  
NIH supports research to better under stand metabolism and the mechanisms that lead to the 
development and progression of diabetes; such research will ultimately spur the design of potential new 
intervention strategies. In parallel, based on knowledge from past scientific research investments,  NIH is 
vigorously pursuing studies of prevention and treatment approaches. Research on type 2 diabetes  and 
its complications is spearheaded by NIDDK, but encompasses efforts by and collaborations with many 
other NIH Institutes and Centers and Offices, inc luding NHLBI, NEI, NINR, NIEHS, NINDS, and ORWH.  
Critical programs in  type 2 diabetes include  a new NIDDK -led consortium Optimizing Recovery and 
Preservation of Endogenous Insulin Secretion that  is exploring approaches to slow beta cell loss in pre -
diabetes and early in type 2 diabetes .306 Another NIDDK -led consortium, the Multiethnic Study of Type 2 
Diabetes Genes  Consortium  is working to identify genes or gene regions conferring type 2 diabetes  risk 
in multipl e ethnic groups.307  
NIDDK’s Translational Research for the Prevention and Control of Diabetes308 and NIDDK Centers for 
Diabetes Translation Research  fund type II translation research (e.g., bedside to practice and the 
community) based on past successful diabetes clinical trials . Among the projects funded by these 
programs will be those that  lower the cost and increase the availability of lifestyle interventions to 
prevent diabetes based on the intervention  found highly effective in NIDDK’s landmark  Diabet es 
Prevention Program  clinical trial. 309 
Major NIH clinical trials in people with type 2 diabetes  include  the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in 
Diabetes)  trial. Led by NIDDK, with additional support from NHLBI, NINR, NIEHS, and ORWH,  Look 
AHEAD  is a multicenter randomized clinical trial to examine the effects of a lifestyle intervention 
designed to achieve and maintain weight loss over the long term through exercise and decreased caloric 
intake in overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes . The primary  Look AHEAD  outcome measure is 
cardiovascular disease events. The study is also examining effects on other diabetes complications, as 
well as co -morbid conditions such as depression.  
This NIDDK  leads TODAY (Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabete s in Adolescents and Youth) , a clinical 
trial that compare d safety, efficacy, and cost -effectiveness of three different treatments for type 2

 182 diabetes  in youth. NIDDK also led the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study with additional 
support from NHLBI, ORWH, NIA, NICHD, and NEI . The  Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study  is 
following participants in the landmark  Diabetes Prevention Program  to determine long term outcomes 
and durability of the  DPP interventions. The  Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study  has found 
that the lifestyle intervention continues to be effective for at least 10 years, and the study has also made 
numerous other important findings including the pharmacogenomic characterization of a gene 
influencing the transport and e ffectiveness of metformin, currently the most important medication in 
the treatment of type 2 diabetes . The study is also examining intervention effects on other health -
related outcomes, including co -morbid conditions such as depression.  
NHLBI  leads an observational follow -up study (ACCORDIAN) of over 8,000 participants who were treated 
and followed in the  Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Trial  is designed to 
further elucidate the long -term effects of the ACCORD interve ntions on  cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
and type 2 diabetes  outcomes. ACCORD was a large, randomized clinical trial in people with type 2 
diabetes who were treated and followed for an average of approximately five years, through mid -2009. 
ACCORD tested the effects o f three treatment strategies for control of glucose, blood pressure, and 
lipids on the rate of CVD events. The original trial found a mo dest decrease in the rate of non -fatal heart 
attacks and some indicators of eye and kidney disease, but there was a stat istically significant increase in 
mortality in the intensive glycemia treatment group (targeting an Hba1c below 6.5  percent ). The blood 
pressure and lipid interventions had no effect on CVD, but both the intensive blood sugar control and 
the lipid therapy reduced the progression of diabetic eye disease.  
A planning grant has been funded by NIDDK to develop a major new trial  Glycemic Reduction 
Approaches for Treating Diabetes: An Effectiveness Study,  which will be designed to compare 
effectiveness of commonly  used diabetes medications to determine the most effective treatment 
strategies for patients early in the course of their type 2 diabetes, with the aim of achieving and 
maintaining glycemic levels known to reduce long -term complications.   
Other significant  efforts include the  NIEHS National Toxicology Program  in which  researchers are 
examining how to incorporate information on diabetes -related signaling pathways into the Tox21 
framework for chemical screening . These efforts c reate an opportunity to use Tox2 1 approaches in a 
targeted testing framework to identify substances of concern, exposure to which may increase diabetes 
risk. 
NIMH is supporting a randomized control trial enrolling persons with serious mental illness and 
comorbid diabetes from primary car e safety net clinics. The psychosocial intervention, Targeted Training 
in Illness Management, involves nurses and peer educators —persons who have both a serious mental 
illness and diabetes and have been trained in illness self -management. These interventio nists meet with 
patients in groups and model positive behavior change and the patient’s active self -management to 
address both the mental disorder and diabetes in an integrated fashion. The intervention targets mental 
health and diabetes outcomes as well a s overall functioning and quality of life.  
 183 Adverse Metabolic Side Effects of Second Generation Psychotropic Medications Leading to Obesity and 
Increased Diabetes Risk was a funding opportunity  announcement  (PA)  issued jointly by NIMH and 
NIDDK to address the metabolic syndrome resulting from medications used by people with serious 
mental illness. Several innovative studies are underway.  In addition, t he first new therapy for diabetic 
retinopathy in 25 years was established in a trial demonstrating VEGF -inhibitor Lucentis is effective for 
slowing or reversing vision loss caused by diabetic retinopathy.  Nearly 50 percent of patients who 
received the combination of Lucentis and laser treatment experienced substantia l visual improvement 
after one year, compared with only 28 percent who received laser treatment alone.310 The trial was 
conducted as part of the NEI and NIDDK co -funded Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Trials Network.  
Metabolomics (the study of chemical proces ses involving metabolites) revealed that plasma 
concentrations of five specific  amino acids were strong predictors of future diabetes in a 12 year 
prospective study of 2,422 people with normal glucose levels. Testing for three of them —Ile, Phe, and 
Tyr—revealed a five - to seven -fold increase in type 2 diabetes  likelihood between the top and bottom 
quartiles.311 
Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) participants homozygous for the most common allele of 
an SLC47A1  SNP (roughly a third of the population) received no  diabetes -prevention benefit from 
metformin, although the metformin arm of the study developed diabetes 31 percent less often than 
those taking placebo. This could represent a major new advance for personalized medicine, as a test 
could identify which of m illions of Americans with prediabetes would likely benefit from metformin.312  
The peptide hormone FGF19, produced by cells of the distal small intestine in response to the presence 
of bile salts, signals to the liver to complete the task of storing glucose as glycogen. It is therefore an 
important regulator of blood glucose levels, and because it acts through a different pathway than 
insulin, stimulation of its effectors may be a valuable new approach to type 2 diabetes  treatment.313 
Other studies have shown t hat i n response to glucagon, the class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) 
activate FOXO to stimulate liver glucose production. Experimentally limiting HDAC activity in the livers of 
mice with type 2 diabetes  helps normalize blood glucose, suggesting another potential route for type 2 
diabetes therapy.314 
A high -fat diet can interfere with the post -translational modification of the glucose transporter in 
pancreatic beta cells of mice, so an insufficient supply of the protein reaches the cell surface to detect 
increases in glucose levels. Mature, membrane -embedded transporter was also reduced in beta cells

occur in tandem with peripheral insulin resistance, lead ing to type 2 diabetes .315 
A compound was found that binds PPAR -γ316 and inhibits its phosphorylation without broadly simulating 
it. In mice, a new compound  was found that  improved insulin sensitivity without causing the side effects 
observed in treatment with currently approved medicines  that work via the same mechanism .317 A 
Phase I clinical trial with the compound has begun.318  
Vitamin D supplementation was found to improve  insulin sensitivity in a 16 -week clinical trial of people 
with prediabetes.319 A planning grant has been funded for a larger, longer -term randomized clinical trial, 
the Vitamin D for Type 2 Diabetes (D2D) trial.  Although diabetes is a known risk factor for periodontal 
disease, new findings show that people with prediabetes are also at significantly elevated risk for 
periodontal disease.320 An observational study of over 65,000 women aged 50 to 75 found that not only 
does diabetes increase the risk for depressi on, but also depression increases the risk for type 2 
diabetes .321  
NIMH and NIDDK recently co -funded a landmark study to improve care for patients with both 
depression and diabetes. The researchers examined a primary care approach called TEAMCare in which 
nurses worked with patients and their physicians to manage care for depression and poorly controlled 
diabetes in an integrated fashion, using evidence -based care guidelines. The study found that TEAMCare 
patients experienced less depression, better control of blood sugar, improved quality of life, and higher 
satisfaction with care, as compared to patients receiving usual care.322  
In addition to research efforts, the  National Diabetes Education Program, a joint effort of NIDDK and the 
Centers for Disease Contr ol and Prevention,  translates the latest science and spreads the word that 
diabetes is serious, common, and costly, yet controllable and, for type 2 diabetes , preventable. The 
ORWH contributes funding for the NDEP’s GDM awareness campaign,  “It’s Never Too Early to Prevent 
Diabetes," an effort to inform women with a history of GDM, their families, and health care providers of 
the increased risk for future type 2 diabetes in both mothers and babies affected by GDM, and steps 
they can take to reduce  this risk.

 185 identifies compelling opportunities for NIH -supported research over the next decade on diabetes and its 
complications. Key type 2 diabetes  research priorities include:  
• Genetics.  Type 2 diabetes , obesity, and their complications have strong genetic bases that 
interact with environmental and behavior al factors. Identifying those factors that influence 
disease susceptibility or response to various therapies is a vital approach for developing new 
strategies for prevention and treatment of diabetes.  
• Comparative effectiveness research.  There are now a sig nificant number of medications 
available for treatment of type 2 diabetes , and research is needed to determine which drug 
should be added when initial therapy with the first line therapeutic (generic metformin) is 
inadequate to control glucose. This subjec t is the focus of  Glycemic Reduction Approaches for 
Treating Diabetes,  a study now receiving pre -trial planning funds.   
• Preserving islet function in type 2 diabetes. Researchers will study whether early, aggressive 
medical treatment of type 2 diabetes  helps to stem the course of beta cell loss typically 
observed in the disease.  
• Complications.  In addition to beta cell failure, type 2 diabetes  is marked by metabolic 
abnormalities in multiple organ  and tissue systems, including muscle, liver, fat, and als o the 
brain ; diabetes is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Research is needed to understand these 
connections.  
• Systems biology.  A systems biology approach could provide an unprecedented depth of 
understanding of the disease variability observed in peo ple with type 2 diabetes  and help 
identify pathways of disease development and progression. Research goals in this area integrate 
many different areas of type 2 diabetes  research to achieve a comprehensive portrait of the 
disease.  
• Obesity research . Stemming the rising tide of type 2 diabetes will require research to 
understand the causes of obesity and weight gain, their link to  type 2 diabetes , and 
development of prevention and treatment strategies.  
• Special populations.  Developing tailored approache s to diabetes treatment and prevention 
would reduce the burden of disease in specific populations, including children, older adults, 
pregnant women, people with other serious diseases and conditions, and minority populations 
that are disproportionately aff ected by diabetes.  
• Translational research.  A key challenge in diabetes research is translating the important findings 
of controlled clinical trials for diabetes prevention or treatment into approaches that are 
effective, affordable, safe, and sustainable i n real world settings. Research goals in this area are 
aimed at designing diabetes interventions to work in different populations and individuals and 
within discrete systems of care.  
 186 Following the landmark  two-year diabetic macular  edema (DME) trial323 that demonstrated that 
intravitreal injection of VEGF -inhibitor Lucentis (ranibizumab) with prompt or deferred laser treatment 
was superior to the standard therapy of laser alone, the NIH -funded Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical 
Research Network is launching a comparative effectiveness trial of Lucentis versus Avastin.  Avastin, a 
similar yet significantly less expensive drug also produced by Genentech/Roche, has been used off -label 
for DME, but data on its effectiveness for this indication is not available, al though a recent head -to-head 
trial (Comparison of AMD Treatment Trial)  in a different eye disease, macular degeneration found the 
drugs to be equally effective for visual acuity.324 
Substance Abuse and Addiction  
Nearly four decades of research supported by NIH have proven addiction to be a complex brain disease 
characterized by compulsive, at times uncontrollable, drug craving, seeking, and use that persists 
despite potentially devastating consequences. Once addiction takes hold in the brain, it disrupts a 
person's ability to exert control over behavior, reflecting the compulsive nature of this disease. In fact, 
many of the drug -induced brain adaptations can be long lasting, which is, in part, why addiction is 
considered a chronic disease. And like the more c lassic chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, 
and heart disease), most addicted patients require long -term treatment, and relapse (or symptom re -
emergence) may occur during the treatment or recovery process.325 
NIDA’s and NIAAA's diverse research po rtfolios, reflected in their strategic plans,326 are geared toward 
preventing the initiation of drug and alcohol use and their escalation to addiction; developing successful 
treatments for drug and alcohol abuse and addiction; and improving treatment accessi bility and 
implementation. NCI also supports research in this area, particularly with regard to smoking cessation 
and tobacco control. In addition, research on the cycle of substance abuse naturally extends to the 
critical research needed to address the me dical (e.g., HIV, fetal alcohol syndrome), social, and legal 
consequences of both substance use in the short -term, and the disease of addiction.  
Research  on the prevention  of substance  abuse  and addiction  includes research on genetics, 
development, and ba sic neurobiology, as well as the effects of environment and social/policy 
interventions on the risk of drug and alcohol use initiation and its transition to addiction.  Large -scale  
epidemiological  studies  (over  40,000  respondents  in a data  collection  cycle)  such  as NIDA's Monitoring 
the Future Survey of 8th, 10th, and 12th graders  and NIAAA’s National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol 
and Related Conditions (NESARC) provide information on substance use and co -occurring conditions 
that can help to inform preven tion efforts to target the areas and populations of greatest concern.  
In terms of genetics, r esearch shows that about half of an individual's risk of addiction depends on his or 
her genes and the dynamic interactions between genetics and the environment. Locating and identifying

 187 the individual genes that affect risk for substance use and addiction can help tailor prevention 
approaches and identify targets for medications development. A compelling example was the discovery 
of a cluster of nicotinic acetylch oline receptor genes on chromosome 15, implicated in early initiation of 
smoking, the transition to nicotine dependence, and vulnerability to lung cancer and peripheral artery 
disease. The alpha 5 nicotinic receptor gene within this cluster was identified as a potential medication 
target  and shown to be involved in nicotine’s aversive properties  (e.g. , withdrawal  symptoms,  which are 
a major trigger of relapse in tobacco users ).  
NIDA is supporting research designed to uncover neural correlates of risk and p rotection that influence 
brain development and substance use trajectories. For example, using functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI), the brain can be scanned in its resting state to generate maps of regions that operate 
together (i.e., functionally connected). Recently created resting state fMRI maps of healthy volunteers 
will help establish critical benchmarks against which researchers will be able to compare patients with 
brain disorders or identify those at greater risk for addiction and other psy chiatric disorders based on 
telltale “signatures.” Such signatures, or “biomarkers,” could become the basis of new diagnostic 
approaches that allow for the early detection and/or monitoring of psychiatric disorders, including 
addiction.   
Abuse of prescript ions drugs, primarily opiate pain medications, ranks second (after marijuana) among 
illicit drug users. Notably, unintentional poisoning deaths involving prescription pain relievers has more 
than quadrupled from 1999 through 2009 and now outnumber combined  deaths involving heroin and 
cocaine. NIDA supports a variety of strategies to prevent prescription drug abuse, including 
epidemiological studies of the patterns, trends, and motivations underlying prescription drug abuse; 
development and testing of preven tion interventions that have an impact on prescription drug abuse; 
studies of the effectiveness and impact of prescription drug monitoring programs; and development of 
pain medications with diminished abuse potential. The latter could reduce the need for h ighly addictive 
opioid medications, along with their availability for diversion and abuse.  
Early identification of young people at risk for drug and alcohol use as well as identification of those 
already drinking or using drugs are key to the prevention of  more serious problems later. NIDA and 
NIAAA will continue to support research evaluating the effectiveness of screening, brief intervention, 
and referral (SBIRT) for alcohol and other drug use in pediatric and primary care settings. In 2011, NIAAA 
release d a simple, easy -to-use, developmentally appropriate, and empirically based alcohol  screening  
guide .327 This guide is helping health care practitioners identify children at elevated risk for using alcohol 
as well as those children and adolescents who have al ready experimented or are more heavily involved 
with alcohol.  
NIH research is also  focused on reducing college drinking and drug abuse and their many social and 
health consequences, including cognitive impairment, poor academic performance, assault, drug a nd 
alcohol poisoning, injuries, drunk and drugged driving, addiction, and even death from overdose. 
                                                 
327 For more information, see http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/Publications/EducationTrainingMaterials/YouthGuide .  
 188 Research encompasses epidemiological surveys of college populations, as well as individual and 
environmental approaches to reducing substance use and associ ated consequences.  
Treatment  approaches  under  investigation  include  research on development of medication and 
behavioral treatments, screening, and intervention practices, as well as comparative research to 
evaluate the effectiveness of treatment strategies for addiction.  
Despite the enormous burden that drug abuse and addiction exact on our society, few medications are 
yet approved to treat substance use disorders. This disconnect has made the development of 
medications a top priority for NIDA. NI DA’s strategy in this regard has been to “de -risk” compounds so 
that they can become attractive to the pharmaceutical industry. To accelerate clinical trials for 
medications development, NIDA is offering greater up -front support to grantees for a shorter p eriod of 
time. This shift was prompted in part by the highly successful clinical trials of Probuphine, supported 
using ARRA funds. Probuphine is a buprenorphine medication implanted under the skin, which allows 
continuous medication delivery for six months  after a single treatment that is expected to improve 
adherence and reduce the possibility of diversion. Another strategy is a novel public -private partnership 
to develop, test, and bring to market safe and effective anti -smoking medications. NIAAA has mad e 
substantial progress in testing potential new medications for alcohol dependence. The inclusion of DNA 
collection and analysis as part of clinical trials makes it possible to move treatment for alcohol 
dependence closer to personalized medicine.  
Behavior al treatments continue to be a critical component of addiction treatment. For example, in the 
largest trial of its kind, NCI -funded researchers from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center found 
that telephone counseling using motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral approaches 
significantly improved six -month smoking cessation rates in older teens. This finding is noteworthy, 
given that 20 percent of American high school seniors smoke cigarettes, and few strategies have been 
effective in susta ining cessation among teen smokers. NHLBI, NCI, and NIDA have also partnered to co -
fund research on smoking cessation in hospitalized patients, and NCI recently funded two special 
initiatives to improve effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions amon g low -income adults and 
prevent and reduce smokeless tobacco use. Finally, NIDA is supporting research to expand the 
availability of behavioral therapies by developing interventions using alternative delivery formats, such 
as Web -, computer -, PDA - or text -based modalities, all of which may benefit hard -to-reach populations 
and increase access to treatment options for millions of smokers.  
Recognizing that only a small percentage of individuals with alcohol or drug abuse and addiction 
problems seek help, NID A and NIAAA are facilitating the implementation of substance abuse screening 
and brief intervention into the primary healthcare setting. In addition to its youth screening guide, 
NIAAA has developed and disseminated its Clinician's Guide: Helping Patients Who Drink Too Much328 
that provides standard guidelines for SBIRT in primary care and mental health settings. Through 
the NIDAMED  initiative329—NIDA’s outreach to practicing physicians, physicians in training, and other

 189 health professionals —NIDA continues to encourage physician screening of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit 
and prescription drug abuse. NIDA’s Web -based Drug Use Screening Tool  (now mob ile and accessible via 
smartphones and tablets) provides a single question Quick Screen to identify recent patient drug use, 
followed by the NIDA -Modified Alcohol, Smoking, Substance Involvement Screening test, which  guides 
clinicians through  a series of s creening questions, and based on the patient’s responses, generates a 
substance involvement score that suggests the level of intervention needed.  
NIDA’s portfolio includes a significant investment in effectiveness and comparative effectiveness 
research th at encompasses community treatment programs as well as the criminal justice system , 
where drug abuse problems are widespread. NIDA’s Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network plays 
a key role in testing evidence -based treatments in community settings, o ptimizing their utility and cost -
effectiveness and fostering their adoption. NIDA is taking a similar approach to enhance treatment for 
drug -addicted individuals within the criminal justice system through its Criminal Justice -Drug Abuse 
Treatment Studies n etwork, an inter -agency collaboration aimed at bringing proven treatment models 
into the criminal justice system to help stop the vicious cycle of drug abuse and crime.  
The study of the medical and social consequences of drug abuse and addiction requires a  considerable 
continuing scientific investment in several areas.  HIV/AIDS remains one of the most serious medical 
consequences of drug abuse, and its link goes well beyond injection drug use, because intoxication or 
addiction often leads to impaired decisi on making and/or risky sexual behaviors. Thus, NIDA supports 
research to improve HIV prevention among drug abusers, enhance screening and treatment access for 
HIV/AIDS and other co -occurring conditions, as well as uncovering and preventing any potential 
interactions between drugs of abuse, HIV/AIDS disease processes, and the medications used to treat 
both. For example, extensive research has demonstrated that drug abuse treatment is HIV prevention. 
Similarly, research is now showing that HIV treatment is al so HIV prevention, in that patients treated 
with HAART not only have better health outcomes, but their decreased viral load and infectivity 
translates into decreased HIV transmission and incidence on a population level. A priority research area 
for NIH is to create the infrastructure and linkages needed to implement the “Seek , Test, Treat, and 
Retain ” strategy, which  seek s out high -risk, hard -to-reach vulnerable populations (e.g. substance 
abusers),  tests  them for HIV,  begins  treatment  in those who test pos itive, and  retains  patients in 
treatment and monitors their care. Large -scale studies have revealed a high prevalence of alcohol use, 
abuse, and dependence among HIV -infected patients both in and out of care. NIAAA will continue to 
support research that de velops and tests coordinated interventions to reduce alcohol use and alcohol -
related consequences in HIV -impacted populations.  
Virtually every organ system in the body is vulnerable to damage induced by excessive or chronic alcohol 
use, damage which resul ts in a range of medical conditions that include liver disease, pancreatitis, heart 
disease, fetal abnormalities and brain damage. Liver disease claims 37,000 lives annually; alcohol is the 
underlying cause for approximately 40  percent  of these deaths. In 2008, alcoholic liver disease was 
responsible for nearly 1 in 5 liver transplants in the U.S. NIAAA continues to support research on the 
underlying mechanisms of alcohol induced tissue and organ damage to identify potential targets for  
treatment, inform strategies to prevent damage and improve the prognosis for alcohol -related liver 
disease.  
 190 Given the prevalence of drinking, especially binge drinking among adolescents, the association between 
early alcohol use and later alcohol depende nce, and other concerns about the effects of alcohol on the 
developing brain, NIAAA has funded a combination of human and animal studies to better understand 
how alcohol affects adolescent brain development and function.  
Exemplary recent advances in addiction science  include the development of a nicotine vaccine.  Although 
studies have demonstrated proof of concept for nicotine vaccines, the vaccines’  inability to generate a 
sufficiently strong immune response  has hindered their success . A 2011 winner of NIDA’s Translational 
Medications  Avant -Garde Award is developing and testing a novel vaccine that induces a strong immune 
response against nicotine without the need for chemical enhancers. This innovation could result in a less 
expensive vaccine with fe wer side effects. The vaccine will be administered intranasally, and is expected 
to enter clinical trials within the next five years.  
Every hour, a baby is born suffering from opioid withdrawal , which can lead to multiple adverse 
maternal and neonatal consequences. Better treatment options could improve public health and reduce 
associated medical costs. To that end, a NIDA -supported study found that buprenorphine results in 43 
percent less time in hospital, 60 percent shorter treatment duration, and 89 percent less morphine 
administered for  withdrawal symptoms in neonatal abstinence syndrome compared to methadone. 
If buprenorphine were adopted as the standard of care for women of childbearing age , it could result in 
a savings of nearly $260 million per year.330  
A cost -benefit analysis of the Communities That Care (CTC) drug abuse prevention system found long -
term reductions in drug use and other risky behaviors as well as monetary benefits relative  to the cost of 
conducting the intervention –a savings of between $5 and $10 for every $1 invested, with returns that 
increase over time. Benefits stem from anticipated reductions in smoking -related mortality, improved 
health, lower medical expenses, and lo wer criminal justice system and crime victimization costs over the 
life course of program participants.331 
A potential approach to treating cocaine addiction (or overdose) involves a naturally occurring enzyme 
called butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which can m etabolize, or convert, cocaine into other compounds 
through a chemical process called hydrolysis. Researchers have previously created BChE -based 
compounds with enhanced cocaine -metabolizing properties and have now extended their effectiveness 
though use of  a virus (modified with the DNA for producing the cocaine -metabolizing enzyme) as a 
delivery method. Over a 6 -month period, cocaine -dependent animals injected with the DNA -modified 
virus did not engage in cocaine -seeking behavior even when primed with coca ine injections, and they 
still had high levels of the enzyme in their bodies at the end of the study. Using a viral delivery system 
for a cocaine -metabolizing enzyme shows promise as a way to prevent relapse in cocaine addiction, 
particularly if combined w ith cocaine vaccines currently under study.332

 191 Most studies examining treatments for opioid dependence have been conducted with heroin -addicted 
patients at methadone clinics, so little data exist on treatment for patients addicted to prescription pain 
reliev ers, especially treatment delivered in the offices of primary care doctors. To help address this 
issue, NIDA's Clinical Trials Network launched the Prescription Opioid Addiction Treatment Study in 
2007, which took place at 10 treatment sites around the cou ntry. In the study, more than 600 
treatment -seeking outpatients addicted to prescription opioids received Suboxone (buprenorphine plus 
naloxone) in combination with substance abuse counseling sessions or brief standard medical 
management, in which physicia ns evaluated treatment effectiveness and recommended abstinence and 
self-help participation. While no difference occurred relative to the behavioral treatments, 
approximately 49 percent of participants reduced prescription pain reliever abuse during Suboxo ne 
treatment. However, this success rate dropped to 8.6 percent once the Suboxone was discontinued, 
indicating that medication maintenance is indicated for this population and that more research is 
needed to determine the required duration.333  
 NIAAA  supported a study to determine if the medication ondansetron, which blocks the transporter for 
the neurotransmitter serotonin, could reduce problem drinking in alcohol -dependent individuals. 
Ondansetron is currently used to treat nausea and vomiting, often  following chemotherapy. Variants in 
the gene encoding the serotonin transporter, designated as LL and TT, were previously shown to be 
associated with heavy drinking. The study showed that subjects with the LL genotype who received 
ondansetron reduced thei r average number of daily drinks and had significantly more days of 
abstinence, relative to those who received placebo. Ondansetron’s effects were even more pronounced 
among individuals who possessed both the LL and TT gene variants, while subjects who lac ked the LL 
variant showed no improvement with ondansetron.334  
The accumulated scientific knowledge derived from these studies and many many others will be used to 
transform the way addiction is treated and how to prevent drug abuse or its escalation to addi ction. 
Some exciting initiatives include:  
 NIDA is interested in harnessing complete genome and “deep” sequencing capabilities to 
uncover genetic information at the highest level of detail to help expose rare genetic variants 
associated with addiction. Othe r areas of interest include genotype -driven deep phenotyping 
(i.e., the characterization and systematic cataloging of biological and behavioral traits relevant 
to substance abuse and addiction risk and trajectories) to determine how a particular genetic 
variation alters neural and brain function to contribute to an addiction -related phenotype.  
 The above techniques  are beginning to merge with a growing portfolio of epigenetic initiatives 
to explain how environmental factors (e.g., chronic stress), biologica l processes (e.g., brain 
development) and exposure to various neurological insults (e.g., exposure to drugs of abuse) can 
alter the expression of specific genes that influence brain organization and function and how 
this in turn protects or facilitates exp ression of substance use disorders. Recent studies reveal

 192 how exposure to drugs can produce epigenetic changes in the germline, or reproductive cells 
that can be transmitted across multiple generations through both maternal and paternal lines.  
 NIDA will ca pitalize on our expanded knowledge of underlying neurobiology and brain circuitry 
involved in addiction to reveal new candidate systems (e.g., cannabinoid) that may be promising 
targets for the development of medications to treat addiction and other disord ers (e.g., pain). 
Medications will also be developed to affect systems common to multiple addictions, such as 
stress -induced relapse or cognitive remediation.  
 NIH Competitive Revision Applications for Research Relevant to the Family Smoking Prevention 
and Tobacco Control Act is a joint NIH/FDA initiative supporting research investigating the 
toxicity and use of new and emerging tobacco products; effective methods to substantially 
reduce the toxicity of tobacco products and smoke; effective methods to reduce  the overall 
addictiveness of cigarettes and other tobacco products; and consumer perceptions and 
behaviors related to tobacco products, claims, and communications about tobacco products.  
NIAAA's Strategic Plan335 includes a focuses on a wide range areas. Th e following are a few examples:  
 NIAAA will continue to pursue personalized medicine by focusing on treatment strategies that 
better match patients to medications that produce the greatest benefit with the least adverse 
side effects and that are based on pa tient pharmacogenomic profiles and other characteristics. 
Pharmacogenomics research will also inform studies of new medications for the treatment of 
alcohol use disorders.  
 NIAAA has launched its new National Health and Alcohol Study, which, like its predec essor 
NESARC, is a nationally representative survey of over 40,000 participants.  NHAS has added a 
DNA collection component to enhance understanding of how genes and environment influence 
the development and course of both alcohol use and co -occurring disor ders.  
 A new funding opportunity announcement  will promote research on 1) how chronic and acute 
alcohol consumption affect behavioral regulation processes at the epigenetic, cellular, systems 
(neurocircuitry), and behavioral levels; 2) how these effects lea d to the propensity to develop 
alcohol dependence; and 3) the influence of genetic and environmental factors on behavioral 
regulation processes contributing to alcoholism risk.   
Age-related Macular Degeneration  
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)  gradually destroys sharp, central vision. As the leading cause 
of irreversible blindness in older Americans, AMD will impose an increasing burden in future years as the 
baby boomer generation ages. Early disease is characterized by yellow deposits under t he retina called 
drusen. Advanced disease has two forms. ‘ Dry’ AMD, also called geographic atrophy (GA),  occurs when 
the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and then the photoreceptors in the macula slowly break down, 
gradually blurring central vision in affe cted eyes. Exudative, or ‘wet’, AMD is marked by choroidal 
                                                 
335 For more information, see http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/StrategicPlan/NIAAASTRATEGICPLAN.htm .  
 193 neovascularization (CNV) in which abnormal blood vessels growing under the retina leak blood and fluid, 
thereby destroying the structure of the macula and leading to loss of photoreceptors. More th an 85 
percent of all people with intermediate and advanced AMD combined have dry AMD. However, if only 
advanced AMD is considered, about two -thirds of patients have wet neovascular AMD. Because almost 
all vision loss comes from advanced AMD, the wet form l eads to significantly more vision loss than the 
dry form.  
AMD affects patients’ ability to read, recognize faces, drive a car, or perform even simple tasks that 
require hand -eye coordination. It severely restricts mobility, forcing many otherwise healthy s eniors to 
prematurely lose their independence and ultimately to be cared for in costly assisted living facilities. 
According to 2004 published data on prevalence of AMD, of the nearly 60 million people in the United 
States age 55 or older in the year 2000,  an estimated 7.3 million are at risk of developing advanced, 
sight -threatening AMD in one or both eyes and 1.75 million citizens currently have AMD. This number is 
expected to increase to nearly 3 million by the year 2020.336 
The landmark Age-Related Eye Di sease Study  (AREDS)  is a longitudinal treatment trial and natural 
history study established that at -risk AMD patients taking high levels of antioxidants and zinc could 
reduce progression to advanced disease by 25 percent. Building on these findings, AREDS2  is a multi -
center clinical trial examining oral supplementation of macular xanthophylls (lutein and zeaxanthin) 
and/or long -chain omega -3 fatty acids on the progression to advanced AMD and cataracts. AREDS2 is 
also evaluating effects of eliminating beta -carotene and/or reducing zinc in the original AREDS 
formulation on AMD progression. Results from this large, multicenter clinical trial are anticipated in 
2013.  
The VITamin D and Omeg A-3 Tria L , the Low Vision Depression Trial, is an interventional trial to  test 
collaborative care between eye care professionals and low vision occupational therapists to prevent or 
reduce depression that accompanies AMD.  
In May 2011, first-year results  from the two-year Comparison of AMD Treatment Trials (CATT) found 
Avastin, a drug approved to treat some cancers and that is commonly used off -label to treat wet AMD, is 
virtually identical in improving visual acuity as the Food and Drug Administration -approved drug 
Lucentis337. The four -armed CER trial also demonstrated excellent results for both drugs when compared 
between two dosing schedules, either monthly, or on an as needed basis, determined by monitoring 
signs of fluid in the retina. Both drugs are anti -VEGF338 compounds manufactured by Genentech. Serious 
adverse events (prima rily hospitalizations) occurred at a 24 percent rate for patients receiving Avastin 
and a 19 percent rate for patients receiving Lucentis. These events were distributed across many 
different conditions, most of which were not associated with Avastin in can cer clinical trials where the 
drug was administered at 500 times the dose used for AMD. The number of deaths, heart attacks, and 
strokes were low and similar for both drugs during the study. The median age of patients in CATT was

338 Vascular Endothelial Growth F actor (VEGF) is a signal protein that stimulates the process of forming new blood 
vessels from endothelial cells and growing new blood vessels from pre -existing vessels.  
 194 over 80 years, and a high rate of hospitalizations might be anticipated as a result of chronic or acute 
medical conditions more common to older populations. Importantly, CATT was not powered to 
determine whether there is a significant difference in adverse event rates between the t wo drugs.339  
Two large AMD GWAS studies (18,000 subjects) identified three new genes associated with AMD; two of 
these genes (hepatic lipase gene and cholesterylester transfer protein) are involved with high -density 
lipoprotein cholesterol metabolism, impli cating a new biochemical pathway involved in the 
pathogenesis of AMD. Weaker associations were found with other genes in the cholesterol pathway: 
ATP-binding cassette transporter and lipoprotein lipase. The studies also identified a new strong 
association on chromosome 22, near metalloproteinase inhibitor 3 (TIMP3). Mutations in TIMP3 had 
been known to cause Sorsby’s fundus dystrophy, a rare, inherited early -onset form of macular 
degeneration.340 341 
In patients with dry AMD or geographic atrophy, researchers d iscovered that a deficiency of the Dicer1 
enzyme in retinal pigment epithelial cells was associated with cell death  of these cells . Dry AMD 
happens when the light -sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down, gradually blurring central vision 
in the aff ected eye. In the absence of  the Dicer  enzyme , cell death was linked to toxic accumulation of 
double -stranded Alu RNA. Increasing the level of Dicer or interfering with Alu RNA rescued the cell 
death, suggesting potential therapies for dry AMD .342  
Investigators studying choroidal neovascularization , the creation of new blood vessels in parts of the 
eye, in human patients with wet AMD discovered that the protein CCR3 is expressed in choroidal cells  
(cells in the layer of the eye that contains connect ive tissue and lying between the retina and the sclera) . 
Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels behind the retina start to grow under the macula. 
These new blood vessels can be fragile and leak blood and fluid. The blood and fluid cause the macula to 
swell and damage occurs rapidly. The damage may also cause scarring of the retina. However, CCR3 is 
not expressed in disease -free subjects, or from early stage AMD patients who do not yet demonstrate 
choroidal neovascularization  (i.e., patients with dry AM D). Therefore, CCR3 may serve as a biomarker for 
detecting choroidal neovascularization  in patients at early stages of AMD before vision loss occurs. It 
also may serve as a therapeutic target: drugs that block CCR3 prevented additional vessel growth in 
tissue removed from AMD patients with choroidal neovascularization , or in animal models.343 NIH is also 
funding research to understand  the genes that control angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels 
from preexisting blood vessels) in AMD , as such work coul d open up new research and therapeutic 
opportunities.344 In addition, n ewly discovered pathways implicated in AMD genetics studies include 
growth factors, inflammation (Complement Factor H), and cholesterol. NEI with NIDDK is planning a 
workshop on diagnosti c and therapeutic potential CFH pathway in the hope of stimulating new research 
areas.

 195 Blood Diseases  
Chronic anemia s result from a deficiency of red blood cells or an abnormality in hemoglobin production, 
as is the case with sickle cell diseases and Cooley’s anemia. Patients can experience pain, fatigue, and 
other serious health problems. Chronic inherited bleeding diso rders, such as hemophilia and von 
Willebrand disease, leave patients at risk for uncontrollable bleeding.  
NIH supports research on the causes, prevention, and treatment of nonmalignant blood diseases, 
including anemias, sickle cell disease, and thalassemi a; premalignant processes such as myelodysplasia 
and myeloproliferative disorders; hemophilia and other abnormalities of hemostasis and thrombosis; 
and immune dysfunction.  Efforts led by NIDDK include:  
 Basic mechanisms involved in regulating the production  and terminal development of blood 
cells (hematopoiesis) and in regulating the expression of genes relevant to normal blood cell 
maturation and function,  
 Regulatory molecules, cytokines, and hematopoietic growth factors that influence blood cell 
production  from hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors,  
 Blood cell membrane structure and function relevant to the maintenance of blood cell integrity, 
the tissue localization of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and the circulation and survival of 
mature blood cell s, 
 Acquired and congenital disorders of red blood cell production and survival (erythropoiesis), 
including anemias resulting from disturbances in the production or function of hemoglobin (e.g. 
thalassemias, sickle cell disease),  
 The molecular biology of he me and hemoglobin synthesis and turnover,  
 The metabolism, storage, and transport of iron and disorders resulting from disturbances in 
these processes, such as hemochromatosis and iron restricted anemias,  
 The metabolism, structure, and function of leukocyte s (white blood cells) and myeloid 
progenitors, and  
 Translational applications of new insights and knowledge gained from basic research in these 
areas towards the development of novel or improved approaches for the diagnosis, 
stratification, and treatment of hematologic diseases, with a particular emphasis on the 
development of disease biomarkers, gene targeted therapies, hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation in heritable blood diseases, and the measurement and chelation of tissue iron in 
iron overload disorders.  
A common  treatment for severe anemia is bl ood transfusion. However, multiple transfusions can lead to 
iron overload which can be toxic to certain organs, in particular the liver and heart. While there are 
drugs to reduce iron levels, additional strategies to treat anemia and limit iron overload ar e needed. 
 196 When mice with β -thalassemia were genetically altered to make more hepcidin than usual, they 
exhibited not only reduced organ iron overload, but also a remarkable improvement of their anemia. 
These findings led the scientists to suggest that the development of therapeutic interventions that could 
increase hepcidin levels or act similarly to hepcidin might help reduce excess iron absorption in 
individuals with β -thalassemia.345  
Fetal hemoglobin is replaced by adult hemoglobin within the first year a fter birth. Reactivation of fetal 
hemoglobin can treat red blood cell diseases like sickle -cell anemia. Scientists recently reported that a 
small deletion in a region of chromosome 6 may be the most significant functional variant accounting 
for different l evels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in people of Chinese, European, or African American 
ancestry. A DNA fragment surrounding this deletion site was shown to regulate expression of the gene 
for gamma globin —a component of HbF —when tested in vitro . In particular , gamma -globin gene 
activation was found to be stronger when this short stretch of DNA was deleted than when it was 
present.346  
Priority research areas identified by NIH include the Stimulating Hematology Investigation: New 
Endeavors (SHINE)  program, which is intended to  promote innovative, high quality hematology research 
relevant to the mission of the NIDDK. In the SHINE program, NIDDK invites investigator -initiated 
research project grant applications in specific areas of basic and translat ional hematology research 
where needs and opportunities for progress are particularly timely. Specific research topic areas 
supported by the SHINE program include: ribosomes and their role in disease;  non-erythroid expression 
and function of erythropoietin  receptors; heme regulation during erythropoiesis; anemia of 
inflammation and of chronic disease; iron overload; and biology and pathophysiology of myelodysplastic 
syndrome.  
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome  
Chronic fatigue syndrome, sometimes referred to as myal gic encephalomyelitis, is a complex, multi -
symptom condition characterized by overwhelming fatigue that is not improved by bed rest and that 
may be worsened by physical or mental activity. Chronic fatigue syndrome  is diagnosed 2 –6 times more 
often in women  than men.  Chronic fatigue syndrome  is difficult to diagnose because of multiple 
diagnostic criteria used by various practitioners. Exacerbating the difficulty of diagnosis is a lengthy 
timeframe for occurrence and recurrence of the symptoms. For example , the definition used by the CDC 
Web site  on chronic fatigue syndrome  indicates that in order to be diagnosed with chronic fatigue 
syndrome, a patient’s symptoms must have persisted or recurred during six or more consecutive months 
of illness.  
The etiology  of chronic fatigue syndrome  is unknown, and no specific diagnostic tests are available. 
Moreover, since many illnesses have incapacitating fatigue as a symptom, care must be taken to exclude 
other known and often treatable conditions before a diagnosis of  chronic fatigue syndrome  is made.

 197 Treatment programs are individualized and are based on a combination of therapies, such as traditional 
and alternative therapies, which address symptoms, activity management, and coping techniques.  
NIAID is supporting a multi -site study designed to address whether a murine retrovirus (designated 
XMRV , xenotropic murine leu kemia virus -related virus ) is associated with chronic fatigue syndrome . 
Researchers at Columbia University are collaborating with geographically distrib uted clinicians to ensure 
enrollment of a definitive, representative sample of chronic fatigue syndrome  patients across the U.S. 
Researchers are comparing blood and plasma samples from patients diagnosed with chronic fatigue 
syndrome  to samples from health y people who have not been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome  
and who are matched to the affected patients by age, sex, and geography. Patient enrollment began in 
fall of 2011, and results are expected in 2012.  
Several other ICs support research in th is field. NCI supports both intramural and extramural research on 
viruses linked to both cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome , in addition to research on mechanisms 
underlying pain and fatigue in cancer, which may have applications to these symptoms in chronic fatigue 
syndrome . Chronic fatigue syndrome  and cancer research primarily overlap in possible common 
etiological agents such as viruses and environmental toxins, common systemic changes such as 
immunologic profiles and cytokine levels, and common sy mptom clusters such as pain and fatigue. 
NHLBI has funded several investigator -initiated research projects predominately examining circulatory 
dysfunction, orthostatic intolerance, and autonomic nervous system in chronic fatigue . NINDS supports 
extramural chronic fatigue syndrome  research directed at effects on the central nervous system, 
including the role of brain mast cells in central nervous system  inflammation, cognitive behavioral stress 
management to improve symptoms  of chronic fatigue syndrome , and categorization of affected  patients 
based on cerebrospinal fluid assays for the purpose of developing personalized treatments.  
NIH hosted a State of the Knowledge Workshop on Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome 
(ME/CFS) Research  April 7 –8, 2011, on the NIH campus in Bethesda. The conference was open to the 
public and was attended in person by over 100 people and viewed by over 900 virtual attendees. The 
workshop brought together 32 investigators from a wide variety of scientific disciplines to discuss 
chronic fatigue syndrome  research. The workshop panelists identified gaps in knowledge and 
opportunities for new biomedical research on this disease. This workshop was sponsored by the ORWH 
in collaboration with the Trans -NIH ME/CFS Research Wor king Group.  
The International Workshop on XMRV, co -sponsored by NIH, DHHS , and Abbott Diagnostics, was 
convened on September 7 –8, 2011 on the NIH campus, Bethesda. Attracting an international audience 
of over 200 participants, the two-day event combined a series of plenary talks with updates on different 
aspects of XMRV research, addressing basic gammaretrovirus biology, host response, association of 
XMRV with chronic fatigue syndrome and prostate cancer, assay development , and epidemiology.  
In May of 2011,  NCI scientists, in collaboration with NCI -supported researchers from Tufts University, 
published a study in Science  showing that XMRV was generated by recombination of two endogenous 
 198 mouse viruses in a human tumor xenograft during passage in nude mice.347 This study provided strong 
evidence that XMRV was a laboratory contaminant, not a virus that infects humans.  
The NHLBI -led Blood XMRV Scientific Research Working Group published an article in Science  in 
September 2011 stating that comprehensive independent  investigation, with blinded samples tested 
across nine laboratories, failed to detect reproducibly  the presence of Xenotropic Murine Leukemia 
Virus (MLV) -related Virus (XMRV) or MLVs in the blood of 15 subjects previously reported to be 
XMRV/MLV -positive (14 with chronic fatigue syndrome ) and from 15 healthy donors previously 
determined to be negative for the viruses.348 
A study from the CDC showed that commercial laboratory reagents and human DNAs were 
contaminated with mouse DNA, which could have contribut ed to false positive assays for XMRV.349 
These reports, and a number of other published reports that failed to find XMRV in samples from human 
patients, led to the retraction of the original study linking XMRV and chronic fatigue syndrome .350 A 
recent study from the NCI showed that at least three different types of contamination contributed to 
reports that there was XMRV in human patient samples: XMRV virus, XMRV DNA, and mouse DNA.351 
Taken together, the available studies provide strong evidenc e that XMRV is not a virus that infects 
humans.  
NIH will continue to encourage research on chronic fatigue syndrome through two funding opportunity 
announcements ( Program Announcements ): Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Pathophysiology and 
Treatment352 and Chronic  Fatigue Syndrome: Pathophysiology and Treatment.353  
The Office of the Secretary of HHS has determined that an  ad hoc  HHS working group on chronic fatigue 
syndrome could be beneficial for developing a Department -wide strategy to address chronic fatigue 
synd rome.  This working group will be responsible for outlining the breadth and depth of the 
Department’s activities on chronic fatigue syndrome  and the identification of opportunities for 
interagency collaboration. Leadership and coordination for the developme nt of the chronic fatigue 
syndrome  strategy will be provided by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health – Women’s Health and 
Director of the Office on Women's Health, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health.  The HHS Chronic 
Fatigue Syndrome Advisory Committee will continue to provide advice and recommendations to the 
Secretary of HHS via the Assistant Secretary for Health of HHS on issues related to chronic fatigue 
syndrome .354

 199 Cystic Fibrosis  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited, autosomal recessive disease of the secretory glands, including the 
glands that make mucus and sweat. It is caused by mutations in the gene for CF transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR), which codes for an ion channel. CF mostly af fects the lungs, pancreas, 
liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. Mucus becomes thick and sticky, accumulates in the lungs, and 
blocks the airways, thereby rendering them susceptible to repeated bacterial infections that can 
severely damage the lung. Respiratory failure due to bacterial infection is the most common cause of 
death in people who have CF. Mucus blockage of the pancreatic ducts can cause vitamin deficiency and 
malnutrition. In addition, CF patients lose large amounts of salt when they swea t, which can lead to 
dehydration, increased heart rate, tiredness, weakness, decreased blood pressure, and heat stroke. 
Improved treatments have led to a dramatic increase in the life expectancy of people with CF, now 
averaging about 37 years of age, but s ome are living into their 40s, 50s, or older. As more and more 
people with CF reach adulthood, however, it has been discovered that about half will develop cystic 
fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD), an unusual form of diabetes that can lead to deterioration of lung 
function and a poorer prognosis.  
Over the past two decades CF research has greatly improved our understanding of CFTR regulation at 
the molecular level, demonstrated the functional consequences of CFTR defects at the cellular level, and 
led to the development of several new experimental therapies. Many abnormalities have been 
characterized in CF, including defects in ion transport, innate immunity, airway hydration or clearance, 
and excessive inflammation, but which of these factors is key to morbid ity and mortality and how these 
abnormalities are interrelated remain unknown. Current research is focused on development and 
characterization of animal/cell models to understand early CF disease pathogenesis; identification of 
genetic and environmental mo difiers of CF; molecular phenotyping of CF lung disease, liver disease, and 
CF-related diabetes; exploration of microbiome diversity in the CF lung and GI tract, and its role in the 
progression of lung and digestive diseases; understanding of mechanisms re gulating infection, 
inflammation, and remodeling and mechanisms regulating mucociliary clearance and airway surface 
liquid homeostasis; and development of therapeutic and preventative efforts to forestall CF disease 
onset and progression.  
Current CF treatm ents are focused on relieving symptoms and improving quality of life. Direct 
modulation of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of CF is a long -term therapeutic goal.   
Current CF treatments are focused on relieving symptoms and improving quality of life. Direct 
modulation of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of CF is an attractive long -term 
therapeutic approach. In a recent randomized, double blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter trial, a new 
oral drug, VX -770, was found to be safe and to confer considerable improvement in the function of the 
defective ion channel in people with an uncommon CFTR  mutation. A subsequent phase III trial 
published in 2011 demonstr ated dramatic benefit from the drug in these patients; 355 the drug was

 200 approved by the FDA in 2012, and is now available to patients, marketed as Kalydeco™. Ongoing efforts 
include taking similar approaches to identify medications that may benefit patients with the more 
common CFTR -deltaF508  mutation.356  
Recent l aboratory studies using cells that have the same genetic defect found in most patients with CF 
showed that the drug suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid was able to reprogram the lung cell environment 
to correct the CF abnormalities. Further development of nove l targets for small molecule “correctors” of 
CF may lead to restoration of the defective ion channel. Other recent research suggests that modulating 
the activity of the cell’s protein quality control machinery may be an important strategy for helping 
boost  activity of the channel in some patients.357 
Unlike type 1 diabetes, the insufficient insulin production in CFRD stems not from an autoimmune attack 
on the pancreas, but rather from a progressive loss of pancreatic function similar to what is seen in type 
2 diabetes. And while CFRD involves insulin resistance and has other metabolic and genetic similarities 
to type 2 diabetes, it is not associated with being overweight or obese. Indeed, a serious concern 
regarding CFRD is that it tends to induce weight loss in CF patients, who are often underweight already. 
However, it was unclear whether people with the disease were likely to face the same array of other 
serious complications endured by people with more common forms of diabetes. Thus, many health care 
provid ers were therefore reluctant to prescribe insulin for CFRD, because no one knew whether insulin, 
or indeed any drug used to treat other forms of diabetes, would help people with CFRD to be healthier. 
Recent research demonstrated that insulin therapy indeed  can help people with CFRD maintain their 
body weight, improve lung function, and feel healthier.358 
Although the genetic cause of CF has long been understood, unaccounted for was the wide range of 
symptoms observed in CF patients, even among those who share  identical CFTR mutations. Investigators 
found regions on chromosomes 11 and 20 that can modify the effects of the CFTR mutations by 
ameliorating or exacerbating the disease as it progresses. They tested DNA from 2,464 CF patients, then 
replicated their fi ndings and confirmed their results in 973 additional CF patients. Better understanding 
of how CFTR mutations are modified by regions of chromosomes 11 and 20 could lead to improved 
therapies tailored to the individual genetic profiles of CF patients.359 
Bact erial clusters (known as biofilms) living in the lungs of CF patients are highly resistant to killing by 
antibiotics. A key cause of resistance is that bacteria become starved for nutrients during infection. It 
was previously thought that as the starved ce lls stop growing, the cellular functions targeted by 
antibiotics are no longer active, reducing the effectiveness of the drug. These findings suggest new

available drugs.360 
The mechanistic link between missing CFTR and hyperabsorption of sodium in airway epithelia in CF has 
remained elusive, but  recent findings indicate that when the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is 
associated with normal CFTR, it is protecte d from proteolytic cleavage and activation.  In contrast, the 
most common form of mutant CFTR fails to protect ENaC from proteolytic cleavage and stimulation. 
These results indicate that  CFTR down -regulates sodium absorption by limiting proteolytic cleavage  of 
ENaC.361 
Researchers recently produced pigs and ferrets with the same genetic mutation that causes most CF in 
humans.  Pigs represent an attractive model for the study of CF lung disease, because their lungs share 
many anatomic, biochemical, and physiologic features with the human lung. During their first six months 
of life, CF pigs spontaneously developed lung disease, including the hallmark features of infection, 
inflammation, remodeling, and mucus accumulation. Importantly, the CF  pigs were fou nd to have a 
defect in their ability to eliminate bacteria from the airways, and this was evident within hours of birth 
and preceded any inflammatory reaction.  Hence, infection may represent an initial step in the disease 
process that initiates the cascade  of inflammation and pathology in CF lungs. The recently developed 
ferret model of CF manifests the multi -organ system involvement characteristics of human CF disease 
(including spontaneous development of diabetes) and provides another valuable model for d issecting 
early CF disease pathogenesis, determining how systemic disease in CF patients influences the 
progression of early lung disease, and developing novel prevention and therapeutic strategies.362 
New information from the CF pig model indicates that  loss of CFTR -dependent anion transport (chloride 
and bicarbonate) in newborn pigs is in itself sufficient for CF lung disease , as there was no evidence of 
excessive sodium reabsorption or airway surface liquid depletion in the airways of newborn pigs. Earlier  
studies suggested that increased sodium reabsorption and depletion of airway surface liquid may be key 
initiating events in CF lung disease. The CF pig model will be invaluable for investigating the connection 
between defective anion transport and immune defects, for evaluating early interventions to correct 
CFTR dysfunction and prevent progression, and for determining whether effects on infection and 
mucociliary clearance are primary or secondary.363 
Priority research areas identified by NIH include:  
 Elucid ating the natural history and clinical manifestations of early CF lung disease;  
 Exploring mechanisms of early CF lung disease using existing and recently developed animal 
models (mice, pigs, and ferrets);

In August 2011, NHLBI issued an initiative inviting grant applications to investigate the early origins of CF 
lung disease and the mechanisms involved in the development and progression of pul monary 
abnormalities in infants and young children with this condition.364 In October 2011, NIDDK issued an 
initiative inviting grant applications to investigate the causes and consequences of CFRD. Review of 
these applications is underway.365 
Transplantation  
Since the first successful kidney transplant between identical twins in 1954, transplantation has become 
the treatment of choice for end -stage organ failure. Despite tremendous progress, however, major 
barriers still remain to the overall success of transp lantation. These include immunological 
incompatibility between donor and recipient, acute rejection, chronic graft dysfunction, and 
complications from requisite long -term use of immunosuppressive drugs.  NIAID supports basic and 
clinical research that focus es on the immunologic processes underlying transplant rejection and 
acceptance, ways to reduce or eliminate the need for immunosuppressive  drugs, and the development 
of new, less toxic anti -rejection therapies.  
It has been observed that some liver transplant recipients who stop taking their immunosuppressive 
drugs because of other health problems have continued to have a well -functioning liver without 
rejection. During FY 2010 and FY 2011, NIAID sponsored a clini cal study to establish the feasibility of 
immunosuppression withdrawal in pediatric living donor liver transplant recipients. In this study, 20 
children who were transplanted with a lobe of liver donated by a parent, and who had been doing well 
on immunosu ppressive drugs for many years, were selected for study. Over a period of 6 months, the

 203 doses of their anti -rejections drugs were slowly reduced until finally the drugs were stopped altogether.  
The results will be published in FY 2012.  
As a result of Highl y Active Anti -Retroviral Therapy (HAART), persons in developed countries who are 
diagnosed with HIV infection early in the course of the disease have a life expectancy of 75 years, and 
may develop conditions treatable by kidney transplantation. NIAID spons ored research on outcomes of 
kidney transplantation and immunosuppression in people infected with HIV. In a multi -center study, 150 
people with well -controlled HIV infection underwent kidney transplants, and were treated with standard 
anti-rejection drugs along with HAART.  The results, published in FY  2011, showed that p atient survival 
rates at 1 year and 3 years were 95  percent  and 88  percent ; 90 percent  of the transplanted kidneys were 
still functioning well one year after the transplant, and 74  percent  were functioning 3 years after the 
transplant. A higher -than -expected rejection rate was observed: 31  percent  at one year, and 41  percent  
at three years. HIV infection remained well controlled. This research demonstrates that people with 
well-controlled HIV  infection can have acceptable outcomes after kidney transplantation, and that more 
research is needed to determine the best immunosuppressive regimen for them.366  
“Transplantation tolerance” refers to the condition in which a person can have a healthy, wel l-
functioning transplanted organ without needing to take immunosuppressive drugs. Eliminating the need 
for immunosuppressive drugs is an important goal of transplantation research;  however, there is 
currently no simple test that would tell doctors which pa tients might do well if they stopped taking their 
drugs.  NIAID -sponsored research in which investigators identified the largest reported cohort of tolerant 
renal transplant recipients, as defined by stable graft function and receiving no immunosuppression for 
more than 1 year, and compared their gene expression profiles and peripheral blood lymphocyte 
subsets with those of subjects with stable graft function who are receiving immunosuppressive drugs, as 
well as with healthy controls . The results, published in FY  2010, showed that  Tolerance of a transplanted 
kidney was strongly associated with a B cell signature using several blood and urine tests. Tolerant 
subjects showed increased expression of multiple genes that control B cell development.  A set of just 3  
of these genes distinguished tolerant from nontolerant recipients. These results point to a critical role 
for B cells in regulating the body’s response to a transplanted kidney and might prove useful in 
determining which transplant recipients could do wel l with less or no anti -rejection medication.367  
NIH will continue to support transplantation research along the entire spectrum from basic discovery to 
phase III clinical trials.  In addition to a portfolio of investigator -initiated research projects, NIAID 
supports solicited research through cooperative groups. The Genomics of Transplantation Cooperative 
Research Program examines how patterns of gene expression and individual genetic variations are 
associated with clinical transplant outcomes.  The HLA Region  Research Consortium studies how the HLA 
region, a highly variable region of an individual’s DNA, is associated with many immune -mediated 
diseases, including transplantation rejection and graft failure. The Nonhuman Primate Islet/Kidney 
Transplantation Tol erance program evaluates the safety and efficacy of existing and new techniques 
that can help transplant recipients tolerate transplanted tissues and have improved long -term

 204 outcomes. Programs for human transplantation studies include the Clinical Trials i n Organ 
Transplantation and Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation in Children consortia; The Transplantation in 
HIV study; the RELIVE Consortium, studying the outcomes of living organ donors; The Clinical Islet 
Transplant Consortium; and the Immune Tole rance Network, a program that evaluates novel, tolerance -
inducing therapies for transplantation as well as autoimmune diseases and asthma.  
  
 205 Autoimmune Diseases   
Autoimmune diseases are a group of more than 80 chronic and often rare illnesses due in part t o an 
inappropriate immune system response that leads the body to attack its own organs, tissues, and cells.  
Some of these diseases may be triggered by an infectious agent or an environmental exposure, 
especially in individuals who have inherited susceptibility.  In the U.S., b etween 14.7 and 23.5 million 
individuals are affected by autoimmune diseases , with women disproportionately affected.  An 
estimated 75 percent of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cases are women; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE 
or lupus ) afflicts African American women  four times more often than Caucasian women; and 
Caucasians  are more than twice as likely as other races to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) and, in 
general, women are affected  with MS  at almost twice the rate of men.   
NIH recognizes that more needs to be done to close the gaps in knowledge and reduce the rising impact 
of autoimmune diseases.  NIH is committed to advancing the understanding of how autoimmune 
diseases develop and to applying results of basic research to imp rove the health and quality of life of 
patients affected with these diseases.  
The most common of these diseases include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) , MS, t ype 1 diabetes, 
autoimmune thyroid diseases, myasthenia gravis, scleroderma,  inflammatory bowel  diseases (IBD) such 
as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis,  and RA.  Organ -specific autoimmune diseases are characterized 
by immune -mediated injury localized to a single organ or tissue , for example, the pancreas in t ype 1 
diabetes and the central nervo us system in MS. In contrast, nonorgan -specific diseases, such as SLE, are 
characterized by immune reactions against many different organs and tissues, which may result in 
widespread injury.  
Autoimmune diseases can affect any part of the body and have myri ad clinical manifestations th at can 
be difficult to diagnose . Genetic traits  may enhance susceptibility to many of these diseases, so that a 
patient may suffer from more than one autoimmune disorder, or multiple autoimmune diseases may 
occur in the same fa mily.  Furthermore, scientists suspect that hormones may play a role in the 
development of at least some autoimmune disorders.  For these and other reasons, autoimmune 
diseases are best recognized as a family of related disorders that must be studied togethe r as well as 
individually.  
Although treatments are available for numerous autoimmune diseases, cures have yet to be discovered 
and patients face a lifetime of illness and treatment.  They often endure debilitating symptoms, loss of 
organ function, and hospi talization.  The social and financial burden of these diseases is immense and 
includes poor quality of life, high health care costs, and substantial loss of productivity.  
NIH supports research and promotes progress toward conquering autoimmune diseases thro ugh a wide 
range of research projects and programs.  Because autoimmune diseases span many organ systems and 
clinical disciplines, multiple NIH Institutes conduct and support autoimmune disease research, often in 
collaboration with professional and patient advocacy organizations.  The congressionally mandated 
Autoimmune Diseases Coordinating Committee (ADCC) , chaired by NIAID, facilitates trans -Institute 
 206 collaboration and cooperation with twice yearly meetings devoted to discussion of  autoimmune 
diseases research programs.  
NIH Funding for Autoimmune Disease Research  
NIH funding for autoimmune diseases research was $856 million in FY 2010, and $869 million in FY 2011  
for non -ARRA (regular appropriations) and $125 million in FY 2010 for ARRA appropriations .368  
Summary  of NIH Activities  
Collectively, NIH-funded research seeks to understand the onset and progression of over 80 types of 
autoimmune diseases and to use that knowledge to develop better strategies for disease prevention, 
diagnosi s, and treatment.  Research on these diseases is funded by a number of ICs.  
NIAID -supported  research  on autoimmune  diseases  focuses  on the immunolo gic basis  of disease,  
including  the fundamental  immunologic  principles  underlyin g disease  onset  and progression,  developing  
improved  animal  models  of disease  and diagnostic  tools , and identification  and evaluation  of more  
effective  immune -based  treatments  and prevention  strategies.   
Nine NIAID Autoimmu nity Centers of Excellence (co -sponsored by ORWH ) con duct collaborative 
research including clinical trials of immunomodulatory therapies and mechanistic studies, and enable 
partnerships among clinicians and basic researchers.  Their goal is to facilitate the identification of 
effective tolerance induction and  immune modulation strategies to prevent or treat disease and 
accelerate the translation of scientific advances to the clinic.  Research at the Centers focuses on lupus, 
Sjögren’s syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, MS, ulcerative colitis, scleroderma, pemphigu s vulgaris , and 
type 1 diabetes.  Two clinical trials were recently completed for treatment of pemphigus with infliximab 
and for treatment of Sjögren’s  with Rituximab. The Centers have also published several articles that 
provide more detailed understanding of the tublointestinal inflammation in human lupus, and human 
regulatory T cells (Tregs) in healthy subjects and those with type 1 diabetes , findings  that one day may 
lead to better treatments .  
The NIAID Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) evaluates novel, tolerance -inducing therapies for 
autoimmune diseases, conducts mechanistic studies  to understand the cause of tolerance , and develops 
and evaluates mark ers and assays to measure the induction, maintenance, and loss of tolerance in 
autoimmunity.  Results from a recent ITN study showed that treatment with intravenous rituximab and 
steroids for patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) -associa ted vasculitis  produced 
the same outcome as the treatment that has been used for more than 40 years. However, the new 
treatment regimen requires a much shorter treatment duration and early results suggest that the 
regimen elicits better response in patient s with disease relapses . 
The Cooperative Study Group for Autoimmune Disease Prevention (CSGADP)  conducts research on the 
development of new therapeutic targets and approaches to prevent autoimmune diseases (co -sponsors: 
                                                 
368   For funding of various Research, Condition, and Disease Categories (RCDC), see 
http://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx.  
 207 NIDDK and JDRF). In 2010, CSGADP sup ported 21 pilot projects that may lead to the development of 
novel targets for disease prevention or assays for biological markers of disease progression. CSGADP will 
be renewed in fiscal year 2 012.  
The HLA Region Genomics in Immune -Mediated Diseases Cons ortium  is a cooperative research group 
that focuses on defining the association between variations in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
genetic region and immune -mediated diseases including autoimmune diseases (co -sponsor: NINDS).  
NIAID continues to suppor t two trials to evaluate autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
for the treatment of scleroderma and MS, including mechanistic studies of these diseases and therapies.  
In the NIAID intramural research program  (IRP) , scientists are conducting investigations of biological 
pathways that may be common to many autoimmune diseases , yielding fundamental information that 
will guide the development of novel therapies for these diseases . NIAID investigators also are exploring 
genetic and environmental f actors, including infection, that affect the development of autoimmune 
diseases.  Examples of NIAID IRP research include : 
 Studies of  the function of immune cells called T -regulatory or Treg cells, which suppress auto -
reactive cells that are capable of causi ng autoimmune disease.  These studies are elucidating the 
different types of Treg cells and providing clues to how they may be used most effectively for 
immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases.  
 Research to determine how dysregulation of the early events in B -cell receptor signaling may 
contribute to autoimmunity.  B cells are driven to proliferate, differentiate, and produce 
antibodies, including autoantibodies, by signals provided through these receptors.  
 Research to apply their fundamental discovery that antig ens, the substances that trigger an 
immune response, will induce the programmed death of activated T cells that cause 
autoimmunity.  NIAID scientists  are testing in mice a new treatment for autoimmune conditions 
that will specifically kill the cells that ar e responsible for the disease.  Effor ts are principally 
directed at t ype I diabetes, MS, and autoantibody -mediated diseases, but the approaches 
involve fundamental mechanisms of the immune system and may be applicable to many, if not 
all, autoimmune disease s. 
 Investigat ion of  the immune responses at mucosal surfaces of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, 
and urogenital tracts  and the diseases that can result from these responses.  These studies have 
led to new insights into the causes of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, as well as the 
development of treatments for these illnesses.  
 Studies of t he autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), an inherited disorder of the 
imm une system that causes enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen , and liver due to an 
accumulation of immune cells in those organ s. ALPS can cause anemia (low red blood cell 
count), thrombocytopenia (low platelets), and neutropenia (low neutrophil count).  
 208 NIDDK funds a wide range of research on type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease, 
and other autoimmune diseases. For example, Type 1 Diabetes  TrialNet is  an international network of 
researchers who are exploring ways to prevent, delay , and reverse the progression of type 1 diabetes.  
TrialNet screens large numbers of individuals and conducts trials of agents to prevent type 1 diabetes in 
at-risk people and to slow progression of the disease in people who are newly diagnosed.  The 
Environmenta l Determinants of Diabetes in Youth (TEDDY) study has completed enrollment of over 
8,000 high -risk newborns and is collecting biosamples for analysis to identify potential triggers of type 1 
diabetes. Identification of an infectious agent that triggers aut oimmunity could lead to a vaccine to 
protect against type 1 diabetes. Or, if dietary factors are identified that protect from or contribute to 
development of the disease, changes to infant feeding practices could be recommended.  
The NIDDK Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Genetics Consortium is a major driver of the Institute’s IBD 
research program.  The Consortium provides support and resources to enhance gene discovery and 
uncover the role that genetics plays in these complex diseases.  For example, the Consortium has used 
genome -wide association studies of adult and pediatric populations over the past several years to 
uncover several  genetic variants associated with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.  
NIDCR conducts research on Sjögren’s Syndrome, a chronic autoimmune disease in which white blood 
cells attack the body’s own salivary and tear glands, decreasing production of saliva and tears and 
resulting in  significant oral and ocular disease and discomfort.  NIDCR’s Sjögren’s Syndrome Clinic is part 
of the Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch in NIDCR.  The mission of the Clinic is to develop 
new therapies based on better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. The Clinic designs 
studies to  address unmet clinical needs, bridge traditi onal medical specialties , and fosters  close 
collaboration between  clinical and basic scientists.  
The International Sjögren’s Syndrome R egistry is funded by NIDCR, NEI, and  ORWH.  The goal of the 
registry is to promote research on Sjögren's syndrome , with an  emphasis on diagnosis, epidemiology, 
causes, prevention, and treatment.  
A number of research efforts are underway examining the potential role of a number of different 
microRNAs in Sjögren's syndrome.  A microRNA is a very short piece of RNA found in the c ells of 
plants, animals, and humans. MicroRNAs are key orchestrators of genome functions in both normal 
development and in disease.  Investigators are examining how microRNA expression affects salivary 
flow, as well as using microRNA expression profiles as biomarkers of salivary gland inflammation in 
Sjögren's syndrome.  Two microRNAs have been  validated as markers of inflammation and researchers 
are in the process of creating a standardized assay for examination of those markers in a larger clinical 
cohort.  Additionally, a large -scale effort is underway to determine the global expression of microRNAs 
and other non -coding short RNAs present in salivary secretions  and salivary glands in Sjögren’s 
syndrome patients and healthy volunteers.  The research data are  expected to be of considerable use in 
allowing the development of diagnostic and disease progression biomarkers that can reflect the 
physiological status of the salivary gland without the need of a biopsy and invasive procedures.  
 
 209 NIDCR’s current active clinical protocols include:  
 Screening Protocol for Salivary Gland Dysfunction : The goal of this study is to evaluate patients 
with complaints of dry mouth to determine the cause and severity of their salivary gland 
dysfunction and t heir possible eligibility for other NIDCR protocols .  
  Pathogenesis of Sjögren’s Syndrome : The purpose of this study is to 1) collect long -term clinical 
and laboratory data to identify pathogenetic mechanisms and the natural history of Sjögren's 
syndrome b y careful clinical evaluation of participants over time; 2) collect information on 
symptoms  as identified through general medical, oral, and eye examinations and  laboratory 
assessments; 3) collect blood samples for current and future laboratory studies rel ated to the 
pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome; and 4) identify participants eligible for other Sjögren's 
syndrome protocols .  
 Parotid irrigation : The purpose of the study is to determine whether irrigation of the parotid 
gland with low -dose topical dexame thasone improves parotid salivary gland flow in Sjögren's 
syndrome subjects.  Participants will have up to seven outpatient visits over 56 days.  Parotid 
glands will be treated with dexamethasone and saline (salt water) to evaluate if the 
dexamethasone helps  to increase saliva production.  
Because autoimmune disorders disproportionately affect girls and women, ORWH has had a lengthy 
record of research support for these conditions, and has partnered across the NIH ICs.  
Some of the FY 2011 grants focus on specific autoimmune disorders such as MS, RA, or SLE.  ORWH has 
also contributed continuously to the Autoimmune Centers of Excellence, which support clinical trials and 
basic research on new immune -based therapies for a variety of autoimmune disorders.  In FY 2011, 
ORWH supported several innovative areas of study, such as predictors of pregnancy outcome in SLE and 
antiphospholipid syndrome, and the study of a new molecular pathway which is likely to be important in 
the pathogenesis and treatment of MS.  
In FY 2010, investigators made a major clinical advance in treating people with a severe form of 
vasculitis  known as  anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) -associated vasculitis, a rare but 
devastating disease of blood vessels.  In FY 2011, based on the resu lts of an ITN Phase II/III clinical trial, 
the FDA approved rituximab in combination with glucocorticoids to treat patients with Wegener’s 
granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis, two rare forms of autoimmune disorders that affect small 
blood vessels i n kidney, lung, sinuses, and a variety of other organs.  This is the first FDA -approved 
treatment for these rare and relapsing diseases.369 
Several research groups have demonstrated that induced specialized immune cells known as inducible 
regulatory T cells have less stability  in vivo than natural regulatory T cells and that inducible regulatory T 
cells may actually develop into effector T cells that can cause autoimmune disease. Effector T cells are 
responsible for most of the cellular immune responses again st invading pathogens and certain 
                                                 
369 Stone JH, et al. N Engl J Med . 2010;363(3):221 –32. PMID:  20647199 . 
 210 malignancies. NIAID scientists have conducted pre -clinical studies that emphasize the need for 
characterizing  inducible regulatory T cells, as these cells interact with immune molecules and can affect 
proteins involved in immune system response.  By understanding more about inducible regulatory T 
cells, sc ientists may one day be able to  manipulate these cells to treat human autoimmune disease.370 
Researchers, including those in NIDDK’s IBD Genetics Consortium, identified 30 ne w genetic regions 
associated with Crohn’s disease, doubling the number of associated genetic variants.371 In a separate 
study, 29 new genetic variants that increase the risk for ulcerative colitis were identified.  Based on these 
analyses, the total number of  identified IBD risk loci has increased to 99, with 28 genetic variants in 
common between ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.372 Finding new genetic variants will help 
scientists discover the molecular pathways that contribute to these diseases and can l ead to new 
therapeutic targets.  
In NIDDK -sponsored research on a mouse model of celiac disease, when the mice were fed gliadin, a 
component of the dietary protein gluten, the inappropriate intestinal immune reaction that is  mounted 
against the gliadin  was further promoted by feeding retinoic acid , a form of vitamin A, to the animals . 
Therefore , in this context, retinoic acid  further enhances inappropriate immune responses, rather than 
protecting against them as it does in other immunological settings.  This study yielded a new animal 
model of early -stage celiac disease to enable future research, and warns against using vitamin A or 
retinoic acid as a treatment for patients with celiac disease.373 
Pathogenic  T helper  cells  are an important  factor  in many  autoimm une diseases.  For example,  
stimulation of the receptor for the signaling lipid sphingosine -1-phosphate (S1P1) simultaneously 
produces proinflammatory and anti -inflammatory effects . S1P1 acts through the enzyme mTOR, which is 
targeted by two immunosuppressive drugs —rapamycin, which is used to prevent transplant rejections, 
and FTY720, a promising oral therapy for MS . These drugs have been shown to regulate the balance 
between inflamma tory T helper 1 and suppressive T regulatory cells, and provide new insights into 
autoimmune disease pathogenesis, and potential therapeutic strategies.374 
Recent research indicates that three proinflammatory cytokines —interleukin -6 (IL -6), IL -1ß, and IL 23 —
are sufficient to induce T helper 17 cell differentiation in a mouse model. Inducing T helper 17 cell 
differentiation can cause severe autoimmune disease, as the cells are involved in inflammation and 
tissue damage. The research shows that transforming gro wth factor ß —previously thought to be 
essential —is not critical to T helper 17 cell formation. These findings provide new insights into the 
factors in autoimmunity, and possibilities for targeted therapies.375 
Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) regulates the activity of type 1 interferons and other 
proinflammatory cytokines during viral infections and in some autoimmune diseases, and

 211 polymorphisms in the IRF5 gene have been associated with several autoimmune rheumatic diseases.  In 
a model of inflammation, histone deacetylases and histone acetytransferases alter the IRF5 protein, 
causing increased inflammation. Thus, IRF5 regulates inflammation in conjunction with histone 
deacetylases and histone acetyltransferases. Understanding how IRF5, histone deacetylas es, and histone 
acetyltransferases mediate inflammation could  inform therapeutic strategies for treating autoimmune 
diseases.376 
A comprehensive map of specific and unique microRNA “signatures” from a variety of lymphocytes 
provides new understanding of epig enetic regulation of microRNA expression during lymphocyte 
development, differentiation, and in the immune response.  MicroRNAs are key orchestrators of how the 
genome functions. These insights into mechanisms of how immune cells regulate internal condition s to 
maintain health and function and the immune response will support further investigations in immune 
dysfunction and autoimmunity.  
Uveitis is a collection of acute and chronic vision -threatening conditions with various causes, but all 
resulting in inflammation in the eye. In 2010, the NEI -funded Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature 
Working Group achieved consensus on clinical gradi ng of ocular inflammation and standardization of 
research reporting, which facilitated meta -analyses across standardized clinical studies and provides a 
common language to describe inflammatory conditions. In autoimmune diseases, the T cells, which 
normall y function to attack microbes start to attack the body’s own cells, often by releasing chemical 
messages called interleukins. Regulatory T cells combat these autoreactive T cells waging chemical 
warfare by releasing protective interleukins. One recently id entified type of helper T cell (Th17) has 
emerged as a key factor in the pathogenesis of ocular inflammation. A robust experimental model of 
autoimmune uveitis helped resolve the complex roles of Th17 cells, interleukin 21, and other helper and 
regulatory T cells. Autoimmune uveitis is currently treated with corticosteroids and sometimes systemic 
immunosuppression, although this research shows that blocking specific interleukins may be sufficient 
in the future. In 2011, the first large randomized clinical t rial comparing current uveitis treatments 
provided important information on treatment outcomes of different regimens.  
 For the mouse embryonic salivary gland, NIDCR investigators recently demonstrated377 that stimulation 
by the cholinergic parasympathetic ne rves is required for maintenance of rare cells that circulate in the 
blood with the ability to differentiate into  cells that make up the lining of blood vessels. Their finding 
may signal new ways to regenerate salivary glands in patients who have lost sali vary gland function, and 
suggests that nerve -dependent organ regeneration is  relevant to the growth and regeneration of other 
organ systems.  
Identified genes regulating the formation of the branched epithelial structures were found in multiple 
organ syste ms including lungs, mammary, and salivary glands,  indicating that temporary loss of cell -cell 
interactions enables formation and propagation of clefts within sheets of cells378. These researchers 
were able to show that in mice, these genes were involved in both mammalian salivary gland and lung

 NIDCD -funded scientists recently explained how glucocorticoids, a commonly prescribed family of drugs 
to treat hearing loss related to autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, do not 
work on inflammation as previou sly thought, but appear to correct an imbalance in ions in the fluid of 
the inner ear.  The research team hypothesizes that developing a treatment based on regulating ion 
concentration, instead of controlling inflammation, may be more effective and offer fe wer side effects 
than steroids for people with autoimmune -related hearing loss.379 
Autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss (ASNHL) is caused by the body attacking and destroying its own 
sound -detecting and balance -maintaining tissues in the inner ear.  Although  this produces progressive 
hearing loss and/or dizziness in both ears , it is potentially reversible . ASNHL is most likely caused by 
genetic and environmental interactions.  The autoimmune destruction may begin in the ear itself (i.e., 
organ specific) or it may be a consequence of a systemic autoimmune disorder such as systemic lupus 
erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.  ASNHL is most commonly treated with powerful anti -
inflammatory steroids called glucocorticoids, and the treatment usually restores some hea ring.  
Unfortunately, long -term use of these drugs is associated with significant side effects, such as 
susceptibility to infection, hypertension, osteoporosis, cataracts, nervousness, and insomnia.  
Encouraged by the success of the immunosuppressive drug me thotrexate to treat rheumatoid arthritis 
and cancer, doctors have been substituting methotrexate for long -term treatment with glucocorticoids.  
NIDCD supported a large clinical study to determine whether methotrexate is effective in treating 
ASNHL.  Unfortunately, the study showed that methotrexate was not effective in maintaining hearing 
recovery in individuals with ASNHL who had been previously treated with high -dose glucocorticoids.  
NIDCD now intends to fund research projects to better understand t he mechanisms of ASNHL and 
develop new diagnostic tests.  NIDCD hopes that this investment will translate into less toxic diagnostics 
and therapies that preserve natural hearing.  
The Cooperative Study Group for Autoimmune Disease Prevention  (CSGADP), a coll aborative network of 
investigators who focus on halting the development of autoimmune diseases at early disease stage by 
means other than global immunosuppression, were renewed in FY 2012.  In 2010, CSGADP supported 21 
pilot projects to test approaches that  may lead to the development of novel targets for disease 
prevention or assays for biological markers of disease progression. CSGADP is cofounded by NIDDK and  
the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International . 
In 2010, NIAID established the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) program as part of the 
overall NIAID focus on human immunology. Through the HIPC, centralized research resources and a 
comprehensive, centralized database will be constructed for use  by the greater scientific community. 
The information gained will provide a comprehensive understanding of the human immune system and 
its regulation and will also serve as a foundation for the future study of immune -mediated diseases in

 213 the human, such as  allergy, asthma, transplant rejection, and autoimmune diseases, and a variety of 
inflammatory diseases.  
NIDDK  plans  to continue  its vigorous  support  of research  related  to autoimmune  diseases  within  its 
mission.  For example,  the over 8,000 participants b eing followed in TEDDY provide an unparalleled 
resource to study the development of the human microbiome from birth through childhood. Planned 
studies will build on research in mice to identify how interaction between the immune system and 
bacteria in the gut may alter the risk of T1D. (Other future research directions related to type 1 diabetes 
are found in the “Chronic Diseases and Organ Systems” section of this chapter.)   
With NIDDK support, the Methotrexate Response in Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis (M ERIT -UC) trial will 
be launched to investigate the therapeutic value of methotrexate (MTX) in adult UC patients for whom 
established therapies have failed.  
NIDCR -supported scientists are working to validate salivary diagnostic biomarkers and to develop the  
related testing apparatus for Sjögren's syndrome.  Sjögren’s Syndrome is also the focus of a genome -
wide study to identify genetic factors that contribute to the disorder.  Gene therapy is being evaluated 
for its potential for inserting molecules such as cy tokines that could modulate inflammation in salivary 
glands to slow or prevent their destruction in Sjögren’s syndrome.  Also, the capacity to produce 
molecules that enhance saliva production by residual salivary gland cells might be introduced by gene 
transfer.  Eventually, development of artificial salivary glands may have application in patients who have 
lost all functional salivary glands because of radiation treatment or Sjögren’s syndrome.  
  
 214 Infectious Diseases and Biodefense   
NIH builds and maintains a  base of fundamental knowledge about infectious and immune -related 
diseases and uses that knowledge to develop new and improved diagnostics, therapeutics, and 
preventive measures, including vaccines.  At the same time, NIH continues to develop a flexible do mestic 
and international infrastructure that allows it to respond to newly emerging and re -emerging threats 
wherever they occur, thereby protecting public health in the U.S. and abroad.  
Infectious diseases are caused by microbial pathogens —bacteria, viruse s, fungi, protozoa, and helminths 
(worms) —that invade the body and multiply, causing physiological damage and illness.  Pathogens cause 
a range of diseases from minor to life -threatening and can be transmitted in many ways.  Influenza and 
tuberculosis (TB), for example, can be transmitted from person to person through the air ; HIV, which 
causes AIDS, and some forms of viral hepatitis are transmitted through exposure to blood or other body 
fluids; and malaria is caused by a microscopic parasite that is transmi tted by an insect “vector,” in this 
case a mosquito.  Transmissible infectious diseases can devastate large human populations rapidly and 
easily cross international borders.  
Threats to public health change continually as new pathogens emerge in nature, and as familiar 
microbes reemerge with new properties or in unusual settings.  Public health threats that could cause 
large -scale disruption and devastation also include the deliberate release of pathogenic agents such as 
anthrax or smallpox, biological toxins,  chemical weapons such as nerve gas, or radioactive substances.   
The NIH biodefense strategy integrates basic, applied, and clinical research knowledge and capabilities 
into a flexible and adaptable approach designed to create interventions that target sin gle as well as 
multiple pathogens.  The overall goal of research on biodefense and emerging and re -emerging 
infectious diseases is to develop the knowledge and tools to respond quickly and effectively as public 
health threats emerge, whether they occur natu rally or deliberately.  
Although NIAID has primary responsibility for infectious diseases and biodefense research, many other 
NIH ICs play critical roles, including FIC, NEI, NICHD, NIDDK, NIEHS, NIGMS, NINDS, and OAR.  All of the 
NIH ICs support AIDS -relate d research activities, consistent with their individual missions.  The ICs that 
conduct most of the research on AIDS and its associated co -infections, malignancies, cardiovascular and 
metabolic complications, and behavioral and social science issues are NIA ID, NIDA, NCI, NIMH, NCRR, 
NICHD, NIDDK, and NHLBI. All NIH AIDS research is coordinated by OAR.  
NIH-wide research on infectious diseases and biodefense includes basic research to understand 
fundamental mechanisms by which microorganisms cause disease, th e host response to pathogens, and 
mechanisms by which insects and other vectors transmit infectious diseases.  Translational research 
builds on basic research findings with the aim of developing new and improved diagnostics, 
therapeutics, and vaccines.  NIH conducts and supports clinical research to assess the efficacy and safety 
of candidate drugs, vaccines, and other products.  As NIH pursues these goals, an overarching priority is 
to reduce health disparities and improve health for all people.  
 215 Infectious d iseases and biodefense inherently are global concerns.  Among U.S. academic institutions and 
scientists there is rapidly growing interest in the expansion of international collaborative research and 
training.  In response to this interest and important scien tific opportunities, NIH engages in international 
research and training partnerships focused on disease detect ion, prevention, treatment , and control . It 
also supports international programs to foster research and research capacity  enhancement  in 
developing countries.  Increasingly, these programs involve cooperative funding, which engage NIH 
foreign counterpart organizations in cost -sharing strategies. Within the U.S., NIH seeks strategic 
partnerships with other governmental and nongovernmental  organizations , many of which share an 
interest in the scientific opportunities provided by global research . 
NIH supports and conducts research on hundreds of pathogens and the diseases they cause, including  
HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, and emerging and re -emerg ing infectious diseases , such as hemorrhagic fevers 
caused by Ebola and other viruses, West Nile virus, Lyme disease, prion diseases, plague and other 
diseases caused by biodefense pathogens, and influenza  . 
NIH research on biodefense and emerging and re -emerging infectious diseases is fully integrated  and 
includes the development of infrastructure and capacity -building, that is, scientific and human resources 
needed to conduct research on pathogens safely and effectively; basic research on microbes and hos t 
immune defenses; the targeted development of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, 
therapeutics, and diagnostics; and training for emergency and skilled workers that would be needed in 
the event of a biological, chemical, or radiological weapons a ttack or other public health emergency.  
Infectious diseases cause approximately 26 percent of all deaths worldwide. Each year, more than 11 
million people die from infectious diseases; the vast majority of deaths occur in low - and middle -income 
countries.  The infectious diseases that today cause the greatest number of human deaths worldwide are 
lower respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, diarrheal diseases, malaria, and TB.380 The top infectious disease 
killers in those countries for people ages 15 to 59 are HIV/ AIDS, TB, and lower respiratory infections .381 
Worldwide, HIV causes nearly 2.0 million deaths each year,382 TB kills 1.4 million each year,383 and lower 
respiratory infections in 200 8 caused an estimated 3. 46 million deaths.384 Malaria is a serious problem, 
espec ially in Africa, where one in every five childhood deaths is due to the effects of the disease.385  
Each year infectious diseases kill approximately 6.5 million children, most of whom live in developing 
countries. For children younger than age 14, infectious  diseases account for seven  of the top 10 causes

 216 of death. In this age group, the leading infectious diseases are lower respiratory infections, diarrheal 
diseases, and malaria.386 
The burden of infectious diseases is not evenly shared, even among developing nations. People who live 
in sub -Saharan Africa are most affected, particularly by HIV/AIDS, which accounts for one in five deaths 
in that region. Africa and the most populous countries of Asia harbor the largest number of TB cases. 
Together, Bangladesh, Ch ina, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan account for half of new TB cases each year. 
In the United States, infectious diseases add significantly to the overall burden of illness. Together, 
influenza and pneumonia account for more than 50,000 deaths annually.387 More than 1.2 million 
people are living with HIV in the United States, and each year brings another 50,000 new infections. 
Unfortunately, approximately one -fifth of those people living with HIV are unaware of their infection.388 
An estimated 2.7 to 3.9 millio n people in the U.S. have chronic hepatitis C, and 800,000 to 1.4 million are 
affected by chronic hepatitis B.389 
Many infectious diseases increasingly are difficult to treat because pathogens are developing resistance 
to antimicrobial drugs .390 For example, in recent years there have been dramatic increases in 
antiretroviral drug resistance in HIV, chloroquine resistance in malaria, the emergence of multidrug -
resistant TB (MDR TB) and extensively drug -resistant TB (XDR TB), and methicillin -resist ant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection.  
NIH Funding for Infectious Diseases and Biodefense Research  
NIH funding for infectious disease s research was  $3,890 million in FY 2010 and $3,883  million in FY 2011  
for non -ARRA (regular appropriations) and $568 million in FY 2010 for ARRA appropriations.391 NIH 
funding for biodefense  research was  $1,794  million in FY 2010 and $ 1,803  million in FY 2011  for non -
ARRA (regular appropriations) and $221 million in FY 2010 for ARRA appropriations.392  
Summary of NIH Activities

 217 processes, and genome sequences and structures . Their findings elucidate pathogen entry mechanisms, 
survival strategies, and immune evasion techniques; evolutionary adaptations; activation of the host 
immune system; and cellular and whole organism responses to infection and vaccination.  The following 
describe selected NIAID basic research activities ; NIAID also supports a broad portfolio of investigator -
initiated basic research . 
NIAID supports 11 Regional Centers of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases 
(RCEs). The overall goal of t he RCEs is to establish and maintain strong infrastructure and multifaceted 
research and development activities. These activities are providing scientific information and 
translational research capacity to facilitate the development of the next generation of countermeasures 
against biodefense and emerging infectious disease agents. To date, over 2000 papers have been 
published by RCE -supported scientists.  
NIAID is tackling some of the most vexing questions in the study of human immunology through its 
Human Immunology Project Consortium . Launched in 2010, the Consortium  support s research to define 
functionally relevant changes in the human immune system, through human (rather than animal) 
studies, in response to vaccination or infection.  The Consortium was funded in its first year by the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and contribute s to developing technologies to accelerate 
discovery.  Findings will assist in development of vaccines and other interventions for a variety of 
infectious diseases includi ng influenza, malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS.  
Vaccines to prevent infectious diseases are among the most effective and economical measures 
available to improve human health. Many vaccines include compounds called adjuvants to increase their 
effectiven ess and reduce the number of shots and the amount of immunizing materials needed to 
produce a protective immune response.  
Two NIAID initiatives are energizing the adjuvant research field. NIAID established the Innate Immune 
Receptors and Adjuvant Discover y Program in FY 2003/2004 and renewed it in FY 2009. Currently, 
investigators supported by this program are working to identify and characterize novel compounds to be 
used as vaccine adjuvants to prevent infection or as stand -alone immunotherapeutics for t he treatment 
of acute infection. To move beyond discovery, NIAID initiated the Adjuvant Development Program in FY 
2008. This program supports preclinical studies of lead vaccine adjuvants to bring them toward licensing 
for human use.  
The NIAID Strategic Pl an for Research on Vaccine Adjuvants , released in 2011, describes  NIAID ’s future 
plans for adjuvant research. The plan originated from a blue ribbon panel of experts convened by NIAID 
in November 2010. With existing productive programs and clear steps to achieve the plan’s ambitious 
goals, continued NIAID investment will contribute to the success of future adjuvants and development 
of improved protective vaccines, and may reduce illness -associated healthcare costs.  
How immunity develops at the earliest sta ges of life, such as within the first year after birth, remains a 
mystery.  Unlike adults, infants lack the ability to mount strong, protective, targeted antibody and 
cellular immune responses to infectious diseases.  Infants can receive antibodies from thei r mothers 
while breastfeeding, but cellular immunity cannot be passively transferred.  Understanding how the 
 218 infant immune system develops could provide insights into improving the effectiveness of vaccinations 
against common childhood infections.   
In FY 20 11, NIAID announced a new initiative, the Infant Immune System: Implications for Vaccines and 
Response to Infections  program.  This program supports research to understand how the innate and 
adaptive immune responses mature and to determine how the immune s ystem learns how to tolerate 
non-pathogenic bacteria that reside in the intestinal tract.  
Infectious organisms are a major cause of pregnancy complications, including premature labor and 
maternal and fetal death and disease.  Problems with the placenta are  a major cause of fetal death, and 
studies have suggested that undiagnosed infection of the placenta and/or the fetus may be a significant 
cause of unexplained stillbirths.  However, the mechanisms of placental and fetal infection and disease 
development ar e poorly understood.  In FY 2011, NIAID partnered with NICHD to solicit proposals for 
new and innovative studies of infectious organisms (pathogens) that affect placental function and fetal 
well-being.  The knowledge gained through this initiative  will provide a basis for developing interventions 
against these pathogens, and for meeting the long -term goal of reducing their adverse impact on 
pregnancy and fetal health.  
Major Infectious Diseases  
NIH conducts research on hundreds of infectious diseas es, with special emphasis on those that claim 
large numbers of lives each year.  Research includes studies of major infectious diseases such as TB, 
malaria, and HIV/AIDS, as well as studies to ensure the health of special populations —individuals whose 
immun e systems are compromised, the elderly, adolescents, young children, and infants.  NIH also 
explores how human behaviors as well as social, cultural, economic, and geographic factors affect 
disease transmission.  The ultimate goal is to translate knowledge g ained through basic research into 
interventions that improve public health in the U.S. and other countries.  
HIV/AIDS  
HIV/AIDS remains a leading cause of death worldwide, especially in sub -Saharan Africa. Although not as 
prevalent in the United States, new infections continue to impede efforts to curtail the epidemic 
domestically as well as internationally.  Furthermore, even though the advent of antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) has significantly improved the longevity of HIV -infected individuals, AIDS -related illnesses remain a 
significant cause of morbidity and premature mortality.  Without an effective preventive vaccine or 
improved treatments that allow HIV -infected individuals to discontinue ART, the burden of HIV/AIDS will 
increase as new infections and use  of ART continue to rise.  The NIH is committed to developing new 
prevention methods and treatment strategies in the hopes of achieving an “AIDS -Free Generation” 
through the combined use of prevention and treatment tools.  
The best long -term hope for control ling the  AIDS  pandemic is the development of a safe and effective 
HIV vaccine that can prevent HIV infection either by itself or in combination with other prevention 
strategies.  This is one of the highest research priorities of the NIH.  In October 2010, th e New England 
Journal of Medicine published the results of the AIDS vaccine trial RV144.  Better known as the “Thai 
 219 Trial ,” RV144 was the first HIV vaccine trial to demonstrate a modest reduction in the risk of HIV 
transmission (31.2  percent  efficacy) and t hereby provide the long sought after proof -of-concept that  it is 
possible to induce an immune response  against HIV  in humans with a vaccine. The vaccination approach 
utilized a novel prime -boost vaccine strategy that involves two components: the “prime” wi th a 
replication -defective pox virus that included genetic components of HIV, and the “boost” with a 
recombinant HIV envelope protein.  NIH will build on the results of the RV144 vaccine trial through the 
Pox-Protein -Public -Private -Partnership (P5) initiati ve. The P5 will advance a similar HIV vaccination 
strategy through clinical development and, if successful, to licensure, based on testing in populations 
with high HIV incidence in Southern Africa and Thailand.  
New vaccine concepts spawned through basic r esearch and developed through translational studies are 
critical for providing novel vaccine strategies.  In 2010, NIH -led scientists discovered and characterized 
human antibodies that can block a wide range of HIV strains from infecting human cells in the 
laboratory.  Understanding how these antibodies neutralize HIV could serve as the foundation for the 
rational design for future vaccine candidates.  In addition, a new AIDS vaccine research consortium is 
supporting basic and translational research to better understand the earliest events of mucosal HIV 
infection and how vaccines can be optimized to block these early events by inducing protective mucosal 
immune responses.  
NIH continues to investigate  treatment as a strategy to prevent new HIV infections --a pro mising new 
area of HIV/AIDS prevention research.  An NIH  clinical trial utilizing supported pre-exposure prophylaxis 
(PrEP) as a prevention method demonstrated that male -to-male transmission of HIV was reduced in high 
risk individuals who were treated with daily antiretroviral drugs.  Furthermore, the NIH conducted a 
phase III clinical trial which showed that in HIV-discordant, heterosexual couples, HIV transmission to 
uninfected partners was reduced by 96  percent  if antiretroviral treatment was started earli er in the HIV -
infected partners. This unprecedented result from the study known as HPTN052 was selected as the 
2011 “Breakthrough of the Year” by the journal Science . Indeed, research shows that HIV treatment can 
prevent HIV transmission, in that patients treated with HAART not only have better health outcomes, 
but their decreased viral load and infectivity translates into decreased HIV transmission and incidence 
on a population level.  Therefore, a priority research area for NIH is to create the infrastructure and 
linkages needed to implement the “Seek, Test, Treat, and Retain” strategy, which  seek s out high -risk, 
hard -to-reach vulnerable populations (e.g. substance abusers),  tests  them for HIV,  begins  treatment  in 
those who test positive, and  retains  patients in treatment and monitors their care.  NIH is launching 
additional clinical trials to evaluate further how testing, treatment, education/counseling, and 
awareness can prevent HIV at both the community and population levels.  
Another key strategy in HIV prevention is the use of ART to prevent mother -to-child transmission 
(MTCT).  In 2010, based on the results of two NIH -funded studies, the World Health Organization revised 
its guideline s for the use of ART in both mothers and infants to minimize the development of drug -
resistant HIV during treatment for MTCT.  The NIH also initiated the PROMISE (Promoting Maternal -
Infant Survival Everywhere) study, a phase III clinical trial designed to d etermine how best to reduce the 
risk of HIV transmission from infected pregnant women to their babies during pregnancy and 
breastfeeding while preserving the health of these children and mothers.   
 220 NIH is also committed to improving the outcomes of HIV treatment by developing strategies to minimize 
morbidity and mortality associated with ART.  For example, the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Therapy 
(START) study will determine the optimal time to initiate treatment of asymptomatic HIV -infected 
individuals to maximize their long -term health.  
The ultimate improvement in HIV treatment would be the development of novel therapeutics or 
treatment regimens that would result in complete eradication of res idual HIV or long -term HIV 
remission so that ART is no longer necessary for HIV -infected individuals.  NIH supported two new 
funding opportunities for research that aim s to achieve these outcomes.  The program Basic Research in 
HIV Persistence , which began i n 2010 , seeks to  increase understanding of the mechanisms that lead to 
HIV persistence and to identify the location of persistent reservoirs in individuals on ART.  Similarly, the 
Martin Delaney Collaboratory  supports basic and translational research in HIV  persistence and latency 
with the end goal of identifying novel therapeutics and strategies to target and eliminate HIV reservoirs 
in HIV -infected individuals.  
Another important area of prevention research that will particularly benefit women is the development 
and testing of microbicides. These products can be used alone or in combination with other strategies to 
prevent transmission of HIV and other sexually tr ansmitted infections. Microbicides represent a 
promising approach to primary HIV prevention. NIH supports a comprehensive and innovative 
microbicide research program that includes the screening, discovery, development, preclinical testing, 
and clinical eva luation of microbicide candidates.  
NIH is supporting research to develop better, less toxic treatments and to investigate how genetic 
determinants, sex, gender, race, age, nutritional status, treatment during pregnancy, and other factors 
interact to affect treatment success or failure and/o r disease progression. Studies will continue to 
address the increased incidence of malignancies, neurologic, cardiovascular and metabolic 
complications, and premature aging associated with long -term HIV disease and ART. Translational 
research is focusing o n the feasibility, effectiveness, and sustainability required to scale -up interventions 
from a structured behavioral or clinical study to a broader "real world" setting.  
Malaria  
 Malaria, caused by several parasites of the genus Plasmodium  and transmitted by mosquitoes, 
continues to be the most important tropical parasitic disease in terms of annual mortality. About 3.3 
billion people —half of the world's population —are at risk of contracting malaria. Worldwide, an 
estimated 216 million clinical cases  of mal aria occurred in 2010.   
People living in the poorest countries are the most vulnerable to malaria.  Malaria is an especially serious 
problem in Africa, where one in every five childhood deaths is attributed to the disease. An African child 
has on average be tween 1.6 and 5.4 episodes of malaria fever each year. Every 50 seco nds, a child dies 
from malaria.  The magnitude of worldwide disease burden and the existing barriers to controlling 
infection, disease, and transmission require multiple approaches for prev ention and treatment of 
malaria.  
 221 NIAID supports research that provides the knowledge and tools needed to make real improvements in 
disease prevention, control, and treatment. Several Global Health Initiative target areas, including 
malaria, are key foci of  the NIAID research program , which  has invested heavily in translational research 
to support the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.  
In FY 2010, NIAID announced approximately $14 million in first -year funding to establish 10 new malaria  
research centers in regions where malaria is endemic, including parts of Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands, 
and Latin America. The International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research ( ICEMR ) program  will 
generate knowledge, tools, and evidence -based strategies to control malaria.  Specifically, the ICEMRs 
are studying the complex interactions between the human host, the malaria parasite, the vector, and 
the ecology at the molecular, cellular, organism , population, and field levels. The ICEMRs also work with 
local governments, agencies, and academic institutions to enhance and sustain local laboratory and 
clinical research capacity.  
NIAID -supported investigators also are working to develop a vaccine aga inst malaria.  NIAID currently 
provides product development support for eight malaria vaccine candidates in clinical trials.  An effective 
malaria vaccine would produce large economic benefits by reducing healthcare costs and helping to 
stabilize the economi es of countries where malaria is endemic. I nitial positive results reported last year 
by the  PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and their collaborators  came as 
welcome news.  In a late -stage clinical trial in approximately 6,000 Af rican children, the candidate 
vaccine, known as RTS,S, reduced malaria infections by roughly half.393 Studies testing another malaria 
vaccine candidate in humans have started at the NIH Clinical Center, with results expected in 2012.  
As part of its commitment to the Global Health Initiative, NIAID partners with organizations such as 
USAID, WHO, the Commission of the European Community, the European -Developing Countries Clinical 
Trials Partnership (EDCTP), the European Vaccine Initiative (EVI), the We llcome Trust, the Bill & Melinda 
Gates Foundation, the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), 
and the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM). Additionally, NIAID supports the  Global Malaria Action 
Plan (GMAP) ,394 an international framework for coordinated action designed to control, eliminate and 
eradicate malaria and provides access for U.S. and international scientists to multiple research resources 
as well as training for new investigators.  
Because the risk of chi ldhood malaria is related to exposure before birth to the malaria parasite through 
infected mothers, NIAID scientists recently initiated a program on malaria disease development in 
pregnant women and young children that could yield new preventive measures and treatments for 
these most vulnerable groups.

 222 In 2011, researchers identified bacteria that render mosquitoes resistant to malaria parasites . Further 
study is needed,395 but it may one day be possible to break the cycle of infection by reducing the 
mosquito’s ability to transmit malaria parasites to people.  
In 2010, researchers described a chemical that rids mice of malaria -causing parasites after a single oral 
dose, rai sing hopes that the chemical may eventually become a new malaria drug. The compound, 
NITD609, was identified by an international team of NIAID -funded extramural and intramural 
investigators following an analysis of over 12,000 chemicals using a robotic scr eening technique 
customized to detect compounds active against the most deadly malaria parasite.  A clinical trial to 
assess NITD609’s activity in people has begun  in Thailand.  Research on NITD609 is a continuing 
collaboration among NIH -funded scientists, t he pharmaceutical company Novartis, and the nonprofit 
Medicines for Malaria Venture.  
Tuberculosis  
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major cause of disability and death worldwide. Each year, more than 9 
million people around the world become sick with TB and nea rly 1. 4 million people die of TB -related 
causes.  The recent emergence of drug -resistant TB poses a major global health threat. NIAID has a long -
standing effort to understand how TB causes disease, and is expanding its TB research agenda and 
capabilities to  meet the challenge of drug resistance.  
The World Health Organization estimates that almost half of all people with drug -resistant TB in 2008 
were in China and India, with each reporting approximately 100,000 new cases.  In response to this 
growing international public health challenge, NIAID has expanded its TB research  in these areas . For 
example, NIAID and Chinese officials with the Henan Provincial Health Bureau launched the first study of 
the Sino -U.S. (Henan) Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatme nt Research Institute in Zhengzhou, China.  
The Institute will develop diagnostic tools, treatment options, and prevention methods for multidrug -
resistant and extensively drug -resistant TB.  NIAID is also contributing to the establishment of research 
cohorts  in India in order to identify biological markers of infection and disease for TB, in the presence 
and absence of co -infections and co -morbidities that contribute to the TB epidemic in this country.  
Among people with HIV/AIDS, TB is a major co -infection an d the leading cause of death, responsible for 
killing approximately 350,000 HIV -infected individuals in 2010.  The HIV/AIDS Networks plan to expand 
their capabilities so that they can address key scientific questions regarding the high rate of TB co -
infecti on in HIV -infected individuals.  NIAID continues to collaborate with the global TB research 
community, other funders, and the U.S. Federal Tuberculosis Task Force to coordinate resources, 
leverage support for fundamental and translational studies, and to as sure that opportunities for 
contributing to the development of new h ealth care interventions are realized.  Through its Genomics 
Centers and Bioinformatics Resource Centers/Databases, NIAID is initiating collaborations with research 
partners in TB endemic countries. These studies are designed to provide insight into the genetic 
diversity of Mycobacterium tubercu losis  and catalog genetic markers that underlie resistance to first and

 223 second line drugs. Genomics data and analysis from these studies will be made publicly available 
through NCBI and NIAID - funded databases and are expected to inform the development of molecular 
diagnostics for drug resistance testing, provide new targets for drug development and contribute to the 
understanding of the differences and commonalities of TB epidemiology in high burden countries. 
NIAID’s product development infrastructure, th rough its preclinical and clinical services programs, has 
contributed to the advancement of many drugs , vaccines and diagnostics that are part of the global TB 
product pipeline. Preclinical and clinical studies on new TB drugs and vaccines are benefitting from an 
improved understanding of host immune responses during infection and disease; innovative new 
immune assays to measure the effects of vaccines; and new drug targets identified through systems 
biology approaches that target key metabolic aspects of M. tuberculosis . 
NIAID’s strategic efforts in coordination benefit all aspects of NIAID’s TB Program , from developing 
biomarkers and rapid, sensitive diagnostics to stimulating the development of preventive  measures such 
as vaccines and treatments for laten t (dormant) TB infections; to accelerating the development of new 
treatments by running adaptive Phase II combination trials, in which trial arms are added or dropped 
based on the interim trial results.  
Some recent activities  in TB research include the following :  
 Researchers are studying the epidemiology of drug resistant and drug sensitive Mtb strains in 
communities to determine their genetic makeup and assess whether genetic diversity impacts 
transmission and development of disease.  
 The biochemistry and life cycle of Mtb can provide critical information needed to identify points 
of vulnerability against which novel drugs can be directed. Some projects are studying the 
bacteria as a whole and understanding the coordination of multiple pathways to ensur e that 
these drugs are relevant within the context of a living organism.  
 The NIAID -funded Cambodian Early Versus Late Introduction of Antiretroviral Drugs (CAMELIA) 
clinical trial showed that the survival of untreated HIV -infected adults who were newly 
diagnosed with TB could be prolonged by starting antiretroviral therapy two weeks after 
beginning TB treatment, rather than waiting the standard eight weeks.  
 Researchers are studying the ability of selected small molecule chemicals to interfere with Mtb 
viabi lity and growth for the purpose of developing drug candidates with novel mechanisms of 
action that can be used against drug sensitive and drug resistant bacteria alike.  
 A Phase I clinical trial is currently ongoing in healthy subjects to investigate intera ctions between 
the experimental drug TMC 207and rifabutin/rifampin with which the new drug may be 
combined when used to treat TB patients.  
 Current methods for diagnosing TB and drug -resistant disease can take weeks, which leaves 
patients untreated and faci litates the spread of TB infection.  To address this problem, NIAID 
supported the pre -clinical development of the Cepheid GeneXpert® MTB/RIF assay, which is a 
 224 fully automated, simple to use diagnostic testing platform.  This two-hour test detects 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the bacterium that causes TB, and also detects resistance to 
rifampin, an antibiotic commonly used to treat TB.  The World Health Organization recently 
endorsed, the Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF® assay, for further evaluation and use in  global diagnosis 
of drug -resistant TB.  The cost of the test has just been significantly reduced to make use in 
resource constrained settings more affordable . 
 Investigators found that an experimental vaccine composed of a genetically modified 
bacterium clo sely related to the bacterium that causes TB protects mice against TB infection.  
The research was funded in part by NIAID.   
 NIAID -funded researchers are developing a number of other novel vaccine candidates, several 
of which have entered human clinical trials. These vaccines are designed to accomplish several 
different goals: preventing infection, halting progression to active disease; and contributing to 
the effectiveness of drugs by mobilizing the host immune response.  
Viral Hepatitis  
At least five dif ferent hepatitis viruses (A through E) cause liver disease in humans.  All five can cause 
acute hepatitis, while hepatitis B, C, and D viruses can also lead to a persistent infection and chronic 
hepatitis.  (Additional information on viral hepatitis is inclu ded in the Chronic Diseases and Organ 
Systems section under “Digestive Diseases.”)  Collectively, viral hepatitis is the most common cause of 
acute and chronic liver disease in the U.S. and worldwide.  Chronic hepatitis B affects an estimated 
800,000 to 1.4 million people in the U.S., and chronic hepatitis C affects an estimated 2.7 to 3.9 million 
people in the U.S.396 Furthermore, these diseases are  often asymptomatic for many years after the initial 
infection until signs of cirrhosis or liver cancer develop, which may require liver transplantation.   
NIDDK supports several research programs related to viral hepatitis, including  The Hepatitis B Resear ch 
Network , established in 2008 to advance understanding of disease processes and natural history of 
chronic hepatitis B, as well as to develop effective approaches to treatment with currently available 
therapies.  The Network brings together clinical cente rs from throughout the U.S. and Canada.  This multi -
center Network is enrolling patients in multiple clinical trials in both adults and children with hepatitis 
B. In addition to the Network, NIDDK funds f ollow -up and ancillary studies of completed clinical trials on 
hepatitis C , including the Peginterferon and Ribavirin for Pediatric Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C 
(Peds -C) trial; Hepatitis C Antiviral Long -Term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT -C) trial; Study of Viral 
Resistance to Antiviral Therapy of C hronic Hepatitis C (Virahep -C); and Adult to Adult Living Donor Liver 
Transplantation Cohort Study (A2ALL), which is investigating approaches to mitigate recurrent hepatitis 
C infection after liver transplantation.   
NIAID research is advancing or has helpe d to advance  the development of new therapeutic agents for 
HCV (e.g., HCV Entry Inhibitor ITX 5061 [A5277], HCV Protease Inhibitor Boceprevir [A5294]) and adjunct 
treatments (e.g., pioglitazone, nitazoxanide) to increase response rate to pegylated interfer on plus

 225 ribavirin treatment for HIV/HCV co -infected patients (A5239, A5269). HBV animal model contracts are 
supporting work in multiple therapeutic areas including novel antivirals, therapeutic vaccines, Toll -like 
receptor agonists, immunomodulators, inter feron inducers, and new adjuvants. Researchers at Utah 
State University test drugs against HBV in the HBV transgenic mouse model, and researchers at 
Georgetown University screen therapeutics in a disease -producing woodchuck infection model.  
In FY 2010, NIA ID renewed support of the Hepatitis C Cooperative Research Centers , a network of five 
centers dedicated to defining successful immune response to HCV infection and to identifying new 
targets for antiviral drugs, vaccines, and other therapeutic strategies for the prevention or treatment of 
acute and chronic HCV infection.  Research conducted at the Centers will continue to advance 
understanding of the immune response to infection and the factors that determine the outcome of 
infection, either spontaneous or therapy -induced clearance or chronic persistence of HCV.  
NIAID intramural researchers, whose work has resulted in a marketed vaccine for hepatitis A and an 
effective hepatitis E vaccine, collaborate with partners worldwide to study the basic immunology of HCV 
infection in chimpanzees and humans and prospects for vaccine development.  While current intramural 
research studies use chimpanzees, NIAID will phase out this research over time.  Note:  The recent IOM 
committee on the use of chimpanzees in biomedical a nd behavioral research did not reach a consensus 
decision on whether chimpanzees are essential to the development of a prophylactic HCV vaccine and if 
or how much the use of chimpanzees would accelerate or improve this work.  
In FY 2011, NIAID funded three collaborative partnerships for research on HBV through the Partnerships 
for Development of New Therapeutic Classes for Select Viral and Bacterial Pathogens initiative.  These 
partnership awards will help advance the development of new classes of therapeutic  drugs for HBV.  
Researchers in the NIDDK’s Peds -C Study Group conducted a clinical trial that showed combination 
therapy with the antiviral drugs peginterferon and ribavirin is more effective than therapy with 
peginterferon and placebo in treating chronic hepatitis C in children.397 
In an NIDDK -supported study, scientists found that a dietary supplement, S -adenosylmethionine (SAMe), 
safely and effectively boosts response to combination antiviral therapy for hepatitis C in adults infected 
with a form of the vi rus that typically does not respond as well to such therapy.398 
NIAID -funded researchers found that liver cell death is increased in the presence of HCV and HIV 
compared to HCV or HIV alone. These results provide an additional mechanism for the accelerated l iver 
disease progression observed in HCV –HIV co -infection.399 
Two cell membrane proteins, CD81 and occludin, are the minimal human factors required to render 
mouse cells permissive to HCV entry in vitro . Researchers funded by NIAID demonstrated the expressio n

 226 of these proteins allows HCV infection in fully immunocompetent inbred mice. This is an important 
breakthrough towards a small animal model that can be used in HCV vaccine research.400  
 NIAID -sponsored scientists showed the membrane -bound transcription fa ctor CREB3L1 is activated in 
response to virus infection and inhibits proliferation of virus -infected cells.  Because HCV infection often 
progresses to persistence, these results imply that CREB3L1 has to be silenced to enable HCV replication, 
providing a n ew line of investigation into the mechanism of chronic HCV persistence.401  
Emerging Infectious Diseases and Biodefense (including seasonal and pandemic influenza)  
NIH is the lead agency within HHS for conducting and supporting research on potential agents of 
bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases that directly affect human health.  Recognizing the 
potential for deliberate use of microorganisms as biological weapons, and the fact that previously 
controlled microorganisms can re -emerge with new properti es (such as drug resistance) or in new 
settings, NIAID has integrated its biodefense research into the Institute’s larger emerging and re -
emerging infectious diseases portfolio.  This research provides the foundation for developing medical 
products and stra tegies to diagnose, treat, and prevent a wide range of infectious diseases, whether 
those diseases emerge naturally or are deliberately introduced into a population through an act of 
bioterrorism. No matter what the source of the infectious threat, the res earch approach is the same: 
understand the infectious agent and how it causes disease, and develop tools to diagnose, treat, and 
prevent illness caused by that microbe.   
NIAID’s research efforts have evolved over the past decade from developing vaccines fo r specific 
pathogens to focusing on the fundamental basic research needed to better understand infectious 
agents. The goal of this basic research is to lay the groundwork for developing broad -spectrum 
antibiotics and antivirals —drugs that can prevent or tr eat diseases caused by multiple types of bacteria 
or viruses —and multi -platform technologies that potentially could be used to more efficiently develop 
vaccines against a variety of infectious agents.  
This move from the “one bug -one drug” approach toward a  more flexible, broad approach using 
sophisticated genomic and proteomic technologies has yielded numerous scientific advances and has 
equipped the United States with a much more integrated, coordinated approach to addressing public 
health crises. This was  demonstrated during the SARS epidemic, pandemic flu preparedness efforts 
resulting from the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak, and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.  
In addition to  supporting and conducting  basic, translational, and clinical research to develo p safe and 
effective medical countermeasures, NIH supports programs to expand research infrastructure . NIH also 
provide s a broad array of preclinical and clinical research resources and services to researchers to bridge 
gaps in the product development pipe line and lower the financial risks incurred by industry in the 
development of novel antimicrobials.

 227  The NIH biodefense research program has achieved major successes in the development of 
countermeasures against significant bioterror threats.  Some counter measures are stockpiled or 
available for emergency use; others in the development pipeline have been transferred to the HHS 
Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for advanced development.  
Candidates that have been transitioned from NIAID to BARDA include a broad -spectrum antiviral drug 
that potentially can be used to treat DNA viruses such as smallpox; a vaccine against smallpox and 
another against anthrax; and several therapeutics for anth rax, smallpox, and pandemic influenza.  
NIAID continues to support the development of medical countermeasures against pathogens  and 
diseases  such as smallpox, anthrax, Ebola, Marburg, botulism, and pandemic influenza, many of which 
pose potential threats t o the United States and international communities.  As noted previously, c entral 
to this research is NIAID’s effort to change the paradigm for antimicrobial drug development from a 
“one -bug, one -drug” approach to a focus on broad -spectrum therapies that cou ld be used against entire 
classes of pathogens.  NIAID recently awarded four contracts to support the development of such broad -
spectrum therapies, which can improve preparedness for all infectious threats, whether they occur 
naturally or are deliberately i ntroduced.  
Researchers have made advances in developing countermeasures to numerous disease -causing 
organisms.  For example:  
 Ebola: A recent study showed that an experimental Ebola vaccine developed by NIH researchers 
protects monkeys against not only the  two most lethal Ebola virus species for which it was 
originally designed but also against a newer Ebola virus species that was identified in 2007.  
 Prions: NIH researchers developed a method that is 10,000 times more sensitive than other 
methods to detect variant Creutzfeldt -Jacob disease (vCJD) in blood plasma. vCJD is a type of 
prion disease , diseases caused by infectious proteins,  in humans that leads to brain damage and 
death.  NIH researchers also used the test to rapidly detect scrapie, a prion disease  of sheep.  
 Hendra: A series of studies including some supported and conducted by NIH led to the 
development of a human monoclonal antibody that can protect monkeys from Hendra virus 
disease.  Hendra virus infection of humans is rare but the fatality rate is  60 percent or more.  In 
May 2010, shortly after the NIH study in monkeys successfully concluded, Australian health 
officials requested the antibody for emergency use in a woman and her 12 -year -old daughter 
who were exposed to Hendra virus.  Both the woman a nd child survived and showed no side 
effects from the treatment.   
 Chikungunya: An experimental vaccine to prevent chikungunya fever, a viral disease spread by 
certain species of mosquitoes, is being tested in a clinical trial conducted by NIH scientists.  The 
vaccine was developed by researchers at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center (VRC).  Chikungunya 
fever is an emerging global health concern.  Although it is generally not fatal it can cause 
debilitating symptoms, most often fever, headache, and severe joint pain that can last from a 
few weeks to several months.  If successful, the approach used to develop the vaccine may be 
 228 used to create vaccines against other viruses transmitted by mosquitos such as Western, Equine, 
and Venezuelan equine encephalitis.  
 Broad -spectrum Therapeutics: A team of scientists led by an NIAID researcher developed a novel 
treatment capable of protecting mice against the bacteria that causes tularemia, a highly 
infectious disease of rodents that is sometimes transmitted to people and is also known as 
rabbit fever.  In additional experiments with human immune cells, the treatment also 
demonstrated protection against bacteria that cause plague, melioidosis, and brucellosis.  
 NIAID -supported researchers identified a small -molecule broad -spectrum antiviral, named 
LJ001, with significant activity against multiple deadly viruses, including HIV -1, Ebola, Rift Valley 
Fever, influenza, and Nipah virus. Researchers identified LJ001 after screening about 30,000 
molecules to find one capable  of blocking the entry of the deadly Nipah virus into a host cell. 
Subsequent testing found that the compound also blocked other lipid -enveloped viruses, 
suggesting that it likely targets a component common to all of the viruses.  
 Anthrax: At the start of i nfection, anthrax bacteria ( Bacillus anthracis ) release a toxin that binds 
to immune cells through two receptors, TEM8 and CMG2, found on the cell surface.  NIH 
researchers conducted experiments in genetically modified mice that lack the CMG2 receptor.  
The researchers concluded that B.  anthracis  uses CMG2 receptors to impair the scavenging 
action of neutrophils and macrophages during early infection, giving the bacteria time to 
multiply to levels sufficient to overwhelm the body’s defenses.  Developing drugs and vaccines 
that block B. anthracis  from establishing early infection via binding to CMG2 may be crucial for 
treating and preventing anthrax disease.  Although the FDA -licensed BioThrax vaccine is proven 
to be effective and safe against all forms of anthra x infection, it requires an initial five doses and 
yearly boosters. An improved vaccine formulation AV7909 induces significantly improved 
immune response with only two doses.  To support further development of this much improved 
anthrax vaccine, NIAID supported the GMP manufacturing, NHP immunogenicity study, GLP 
safety and toxicity evaluation, and the development of a guinea pig post -exposure prophylaxis 
(PEP) aerosol challenge model. The data enabled the ongoing phase 1b trial to optimize 
dose/schedul e for the AV7909.  
 Botulism: NIAID has supported the development of XOMA 3AB, a monoclonal antibody designed 
to treat ingested and aerosolized botulinum toxin A, from basic research through discovery and 
preclinical testing. In 2011, this therapeutic entere d a Phase I clinical study at a NIAID -supported 
clinical unit at Johns Hopkins University. NIAID also has supported the development of 
monoclonal antibodies against botulinum toxin types B and E with significant progress made 
toward identifying suitable ca ndidates.  
 Pneumonic Plague:  In collaboration with the FDA, NIAID is supporting animal studies to 
determine whether newer antibiotics approved for other uses are also effective against 
 229 pneumonic plague. This  approach may set a precedent for FDA approval of other medical 
countermeasures under the Animal Rule.402 
Another priorit y in emerging infectious diseases include s seasonal and pandemic influenza . Each  annual 
influenza outbreak in the United States typically occu rs between December and March.  Every year in the 
United States, on average 5 percent to 20 percent of the population contracts influenza and more than 
200,000 people are hospitalized with complications from influenza infection. And each year, seasonal 
influenza is estimated to kill an a verage of 36,000 Americans.   
Influenza is a significant public health challenge, due in part to the limitations of current influenza 
vaccines and treatments.  For example, resistance to influenza antiviral medications frequently emerges. 
In recent years, seasonal influenza viruses have become resistant to therapeutic agents, first to 
adamantanes and then to oseltamivir.  Hence, it is critical to maintain a pipeline of new and improved 
anti-influenza medications.  In addition, although egg -based manufacturing  methods have served  well 
for more than 40 years, they are logistically complex and can lead to delays or shortages if the vaccine 
strain of influenza virus will not grow  efficiently.  NIH and industry partners have made progress in 
accelerating the develop ment of additional manufacturing methods including cell -based manufacturing.  
These advances will help build a more reliable domestic manufacturing capacity that could b e rapidly 
mobilized in response to the emergence of a pandemic virus.  
NIAID conducts and  supports a broad range of basic and translational research on influenza, including 
research and development of new therapies, diagnostics, and vaccines for both seaso nal and pandemic 
influenza strains. Included in these efforts is research to develop a “u niversal” influenza vaccine that 
induces a potent immune response to the common elements of the influenza virus that undergo very 
few changes from season to season, an d from strain to strain. A universal influenza vaccine has the 
potential to protect again st multiple strains of the virus over several years.  In addition, improved 
antiviral treatments and vaccine manufacturing capacity for influenza could have broad applicability 
against other infectious diseases.  
The NIAID intramural research program conduct s collaborative influenza research with many public and 
private sector partners, and i n FY 2010, NIAID intramural investigators engaged in a government -wide 
effort to understand the pathogenesis of mild to severe pandemic influenza and facilitate the 
devel opment of novel therapies and strategies for treating severe influenza. Other m ajor research 
programs include: needle -free pandemic influenza vaccine development through a collaboration with 
MedImmune, Inc.; nasal spray vaccine development and testing against H9N2, H5N1, H7N3, H2N2 and 
H6N1 viruses with pandemic potential; basic influenza biology, transmission, and pathogenesis studies 
in animal models; natural history studies of influenza viruses, including studies of human immune 
response and pathogen esis; and clinical studies at the NIH Clinical Center and elsewhere to characterize 
and treat severe influenza in various populations using existing and experimental therapeutic strategies.   
                                                 
402 For more information, see 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/EmergencyPreparedness/MedicalCountermeasures/UCM283166.pdf .  
 230 NIAID ranks the development of a “universal” influenza vaccine as  one of its top scientific priorities 
because it would eliminate the need to modify the influenza vaccine every season.  NIAID intramural 
researchers recently demonstrated that a “prime -boost” vaccine strategy protected animals from 
infection with multiple strains of influenza.  The vaccine produced an “unnatural immunity”, inducing a 
response to parts of the influenza virus that are conserved between even distantly related virus strains.  
More recently, this approach was evaluated in two small clinical trials , with participants producing 
evidence of cross -protective antibodies.  A universal flu vaccine would be an extraordinary improvement 
over today’s seasonal flu vaccines, resulting in considerable savings and saved lives.  In addition, a 
number of extramural researchers are also working on novel approaches to develop a vaccine which is 
broadly reactive with multiple influenza subtypes by targeting conserved internal proteins of the virus as 
well as less variable regions of the hemagglutinin protein.  
NIAID inve stigators initiated collaborations with Mexican health authorities to address the impact and 
epidemiology of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza in that country. In addition, during the course of the 
2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, NIAID conducted 12 clinical t rials through its longstanding Vaccine 
Treatment and Evaluation Units  (VTEUs), six of which provided information that helped build the 
foundation for the nationwide 2009 H1N1 immunization campaign.  Trial data offered key scientific 
evidence essential for p ublic health decision -making, including optimal dosage and number of doses for 
individuals in different age brackets and for specific high -risk groups of particular concern such as 
pregnant women.  Studies on concurrent administration of H1N1 vaccine and se asonal influenza vaccine 
demonstrated that two influenza vaccines could be safely administered at the same time.  NIAID -
sponsored clinical trials also provided data on the use of the vaccine in selected populations with 
underlying health conditions, includi ng HIV and asthma, and also examined the use of an adjuvant with 
H1N1 vaccine, which showed that the adjuvant was safe and could be used to stretch the vaccine 
supply. The information and experience that was gained from all of these clinical trials will ap ply well 
beyond the 2009 H1N1 influenza.  
NIAID continues to support the Centers for Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS) 
Program. The CEIRS Program is an integrated network of five centers that was established in 2007, 
building upon a n NIAID -funded program begun at St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital in 1999. The Program 
brings together multidisciplinary teams of researchers to expand the NIAID influenza virus surveillance 
program, both internationally and in the United States, and to study  host immune responses, 
pathogenesis, the factors that control the emergence and transmission of influenza viruses among 
animal reservoirs, and the immunological factors that determine whether an influenza virus causes only 
mild illness or causes death.  The CEIRS Program continually monitors cases of animal and human 
influenza worldwide to rapidly detect and characterize viruses that may have pandemic potential and to 
create pandemic vaccine candidates. Ultimately, the CEIRS network will lay the groundwork for new and 
improved control measures for emerging and reemerging influenza viruses.   
NIAID supported the development of the FilmArray Respiratory System, which is capable of 
simultaneously detecting 15 respiratory viruses (including several influenza stra ins) in one hour.  The 
initial FilmArray system was approved by the FDA in 2011.  Since 2005, NIAID has awarded small business 
grants and NIAID partnerships to Idaho Technology, Inc., to support development of this multiplex 
 231 diagnostic platform from initial prototype through the current version. This support was essential for 
Idaho Technology to develop the FilmArray Respiratory Panel. NIAID's preclinical resources also played a 
role in developing the HT -FilmArray. Influenza sequences generated by NIAID's Gen omics Sequencing 
Centers and made available through the Influenza Research Database facilitated design of the influenza 
detection assays included in this platform. Avian influenza strains obtained from the BEI repository were 
used to validate the assays.  
NIAID also supports international collaborations, including through the Southeast Asia Infectious 
Diseases Clinical Research Network, which has assembled a 17 -site network in Thailand, Vietnam, and 
Indonesia to address issues of emerging influenza viruses a nd other emerging infections, as well as in 
Mexico, where five sites in Mexico City address the impact and epidemiology of influenza -like illness in 
the region.  
Antimicro bial resistance  is a significant and increasing health concern, and NIH funds research  to 
understand and address it.  Infectious microbes have a remarkable ability to evade and resist the actions 
of antimicrobial drugs. Combined with the overuse of antibiotics, this has led to an increase in the 
number of drug resistant infections.  To that end, NIAID supports and conducts research on many 
aspects of antimicrobial (drug) resistance, from basic research on how microbes develop resistance , to 
clinical trials that translate research from lab findings to potential treatments.  Several new research  
initiatives  will advance this important research effort.  
The NIAID -sponsored Targeted Clinical Trials to Reduce the Risk of Antimicrobial Resistance program403 
explores improved treatment strategies to help reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance and pr eserve 
the effectiveness of existing drugs.  NIAID now supports eight large -scale clinical trials to evaluate 
treatment alternatives for diseases where antibiotics are prescribed most often, including acute otitis 
media, community -acquired pneumonia, and skin and soft tissue infections caused by community -
acquired methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (CA-MRSA) . 
The Partnerships for the Development of Therapeutics and Diagnostics for Drug -Resistant Bacteria and 
Eukaryotic Parasites  initiative focuses on advancing the development of diagnostics and therapeutics for 
drug -resistant pathogens.  Nineteen projects were awarded in 2010. In addition, NIAID  issued the  
Partnerships for Development of New Therapeutic Classes for Select Viral and Bacterial Pathogens404 
funding announcement in FY 2010 to address the threat to public health presented by drug resistance in 
the Clostridium difficile  bacteria, which causes severe intestinal disease, in Neisseria gonorrhoeae , which 
causes gonorrhea, and in strains o f hepatitis B virus.  
In FY 2011, NIAID issued  the Targeting Resistance in Select Gram -Negative Pathogens  initiative  to 
stimulate innovation in the discovery and development of novel therapeutic approaches for infections 
caused by resistant Gram -negative ba cteria.  NIAID  also launched the  Host -Targeted Interventions as 
Therapeutics for Infectious Diseases  program in FY 2011 aims to discover and develop therapeutics that 
target host functions required for infection, replication, spread and/or pathogenesis by priority

 232 pathogens.  Research supported in this program suggests that an intervention that targets th e essential 
host function would have broad -spectrum efficacy.  Moreover, targeting a host function reduces 
selective pressure on the microbe to acquire resistant mutations, making resistance less likely to 
emerge.  When using the knowledge gained to develop drugs targeted against host functions with that 
known about microbial pathogenesis, significant steps could be made leading to the treatment of many 
microbial threats, including priority pathogens deemed highly threatening to public health.  
Dengue fever, a mosquito -borne flu -like illness that can turn deadly, continues to increase in the tropics 
and subtropics. It has the potential to spread in temperate zones and appears to be increasing in 
severity . NIAID dengue research priorities include elucidating th e viral/human genetics and 
immunological factors that contribute to disease severity and the pre -clinical development and clinical 
evaluation of rapid diagnostics, therapies, and vaccines against dengue.  The dengue research program 
received an important bo ost from American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which NIAID used to 
advance studies of the immune responses to viral infection and the effects of mucosal dengue 
vaccination and other novel vaccine development strategies.  In 2010, NIAID researchers announc ed they 
had developed an experimental vaccine against dengue after ten years of research.  Clinical trials to 
evaluate the safety of this vaccine in healthy adults are underway in the United States and trials are 
planned in dengue -endemic countries.  Other N IAID -supported investigators are developing vaccines 
using a variety of technologies to improve the delivery methods and ability to stimulate an immune 
response to dengue infection.  For example, NIAID recently awarded a contract to develop a novel 
dengue v accine that can be delivered through the skin without the use of needles and to evaluate this 
vaccine for safety and immunogenicity in clinical trials in the United States and abroad.  Two other 
vaccines, whose development was partially supported by NIAID, are currently being tested by 
companies.  Altogether, the Institute supports a wide array of dengue research activities and will 
continue to do so until the disease is under control or eliminated.  
NIH also helps coordinate research to develop safe and effec tive medical countermeasures against 
chemical weapons.  The NIH Countermeasures Against  Chemical Threats (CounterACT) Research 
Network supports the development of medical countermeasures to prevent, diagnose, and treat 
conditions caused by chemical agents that might be used in a terrorist attack or released by industrial 
accidents or natural  disasters.  The network is a collaboration between the NIH and the U.S. Department 
of Defense, including the CounterACT Research Centers of Excellence, individual research projects, small 
business research grants, contracts, and other programs that conduct  basic, translational, and clinical 
research. The CounterACT Research Network solicited proposals from academia, other governmental 
agencies, and industry. In Fiscal Year 2006, the CounterACT Research Network established four Research 
Centers of Excellence  in Medical Chemical Research.  The network enabled the development of 
therapeutics for cyanide, nerve agents, chlorine, sulfur mustard, and radiation exposures.  Training of 
personnel remains a critical facet of effective response to a release of chemical o r nuclear/radiological 
material.  For the past 15 years , NIH has worked with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) 
to provide high -quality training for hazardous materials emergency responders.  
NIH continues to lead HHS efforts to sponsor and coo rdinate research to develop medical 
countermeasures to mitigate and/or treat radiation -induced damage.  Many candidate medical 
 233 countermeasures are in the early stages of discovery, including medical countermeasures for 
hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome  (ARS), gastrointestinal ARS, radiation -induced lung 
pneumonitis and/or fibrosis, and other radiation -induced injuries.  Key efforts underway focus on 
developing decorporation agents -- specific drugs that remove radioactive isotopes from the body.  Three 
orally bioavailable decorporation agents moving toward  Investigational New Drug Application 
submission will be used to treat victims with internal radionuclide contamination from fallout or “dirty 
bombs”. At the same time, an IND for an  oral decorporation age nt has  been  filed with the FDA and the 
project is now being  fund ed by  HHS/BARDA for advanced development.  
NIAID established the Centers for Countermeasures Against Radiation (CMCR) program in 2005 in an 
effort to develop medical products to diagnose, prev ent and treat the short - and long -term 
consequences of radiation exposure after a radiological or nuclear accident or terrorist attack. The 
program supported over 100 pilot studies and attracted a number of new investigators from fields 
outside radiobiolog y research and developed educational materials in radiation biology for trainees 
across the United States.  The program has yielded include numerous publications, and several patents 
were filed.  The efforts of CMCR helped to revitalize an area of science th at had been dormant for many 
years. To expand on these efforts, NIAID agreed to provide five years of additional funding to the 
program beginning in fiscal year 2010. Seven academic institutions from across the country participated 
in the renewed program. A progress report detailing the research priorities for the nuclear/radiation 
countermeasures program was published in 2012.405 
NIH has invested substantially in the intellectual and physical infrastructure needed to build the nation’s 
capacity for research on biodefense and emerging infectious diseases.  The physical and intellectual 
research infrastructure that NIAID has built over the years is critical to the development of medical 
countermeasures and has increased the nation’s ability to respond to new and  re-emerging infectious 
diseases.  This comprehensive infrastructure includes:  
 National and Regional Biocontainment Laboratories  are 14  extramural laboratories that provide 
BSL-4/3/2 and BSL -3/2 biocontainment facilities, respectively, for research on biode fense and 
emerging infectious disease agents. The biosafety labs also are available  or under construction, 
and prepared to assist national, state, and local public health efforts in the event of a 
bioterrorism or infectious disease emergency.  In addition t o their own research, the labs 
support the NIAID Biodefense Research Agenda.  
 Cooperative Centers for Translation al Research on Human Immunology and Biodefense  consists 
of eight centers that aim to translate research on immunity to infection into clinical applications 
to protect the public against bioterrorist threats.  
 Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs)  are c linical sites located at universities 
nationwide that p rovide extensive clinical trials capacity and expertise.  The VTEUs played a key 
role in testing the vaccine for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.

 234  The HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Networks  is an  ongoing robust research program in HIV/AIDS 
currently being expanded to add capacity to address AIDS co -morbidities such as tuberculosis 
and hepatitis.  In addition, NIAID unveiled plans to create a new clinical trial network focused on 
antibacterial resistance . 
 NIAID genomics activities . NIAID has developed a comprehensive genomics program. In addition 
to sequencing thousands of microbial genomes, NIAID genomics activities provide the scientific 
community with genomic data as well as resources such as  reagents, databases, software, and 
computational tools essential for analyzing and applying research findings.  Coupled with other 
biochemical and microbiological information, sequence data are helping scientists to identify 
specific strains of microbes, d evelop sequence -based detection technologies and diagnostics, 
and identify targets for new drugs and vaccines.  
 Preclinical services . NIAID offers a broad array of resources for researchers to assist in 
characterizing  and evaluating candidate products. Services are intended to provide critical 
information to move a product forward, thus lowering the risks of e ntering the product 
development pathway. The resources provided to researchers  include: in vitro assessment for  
antimicrobial activity, animal models of infectious diseases, and therapeutic development 
services.  Plans are underway to provide vaccine development services as well.  
o The In Vitro  Assessment for Antimicrobial Activity program tests antimicrobial activity  of 
products against microbial pathogens and vectors, including those derived from clinical 
specimens.  
o The Animal Models of Infectious Diseases program conducts three types of services: 
development and refinement of animal models; i n vivo  screening, and ef ficacy testing.  
o The Therapeutic Development Services program supports the development of products 
intended for use in the cure, mitigation, diagnosis or treatment of disease caused by a 
pathogen or certain toxins, including, those derived from biotechnolog y processes.  
Controlling infectious diseases not only saves lives but is essential for building a strong global economy 
and maintaining international stability.  Through its support for research that underpins intervention 
programs, NIH participates in several efforts , including the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS 
Relief; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; and other global initiatives.  NIH 
supports networks of U.S. and international scientists, trains U.S. and foreign inve stigators to work 
internationally, and enhances basic biomedical, clinical, and behavioral research capacity and facilities 
around the world.  Partnerships, including those with bilateral and multilateral international partners, 
industry, and host governmen ts, provide extraordinary opportunities for research on vaccines, drugs, 
and new diagnostics to benefit local populations where the research is done.  
NIH funds and partners with institutions and researchers throughout the world and especially in places 
whe re diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, dengue, and neglected tropical diseases remain 
 235 endemic.  The following are selected examples of NIAID’s programs that illustrate the variety of models 
and platforms made available to support international  research.  
The International Centers for Excellence in Research (ICER)  program was launched in 2002 to develop 
and sustain research programs in disease endemic countries through partnerships with local scientists.  
While the ICER program is focused on clin ical research in infectious diseases, each center has the 
capability to address the research and training needs of greatest relevance to the local population.  The 
ICER program builds on experience gained from NIAID’s long -standing malaria research collabor ation 
with scientists in Mali, West Africa.  The NIAID Division of Intramural Research, through long -term 
collaborations with colleagues in country, has developed a core research program at each site and, over 
time, has provided opportunities to expand the research capabilities and programs.  The improvement of 
laboratory and clinical field site infrastructure and the enhancement of information technology 
capability have been critical components of this effort.  NIAID extramural divisions also have provided 
support to investigators at these sites and aim to continue to support ICER programs through the 
extramural scientific community.  The current ICER sites are located in Mali, Uganda, and India.  
NIAID HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Networks (comprising leadership g roups and trial sites) provide a domestic 
and international research infrastructure for conducting clinical trials on all aspects of HIV/AIDS.  These 
networks provide multiple opportunities for cross -NIH collaborations, with NIMH, NICHD, NIDA, NINDS, 
NCI, N IDCR, and OAR providing additional funding for specific networks or studies.  NIAID is expanding 
the scope of the network’s current activities to include the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis 
and hepatitis, major co -infections with HIV, and has also leveraged this infrastructure for an intramural 
study testing a new HPIV3 vaccine in infants.  
South East Asia Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network  (SEAICRN) was founded in 2005 in 
response to the global challenge posed by avian influenza to condu ct research on human and avian 
influenza and other infectious diseases of importance to the region.  In concert with the World Health 
Organization , the Wellcome Trust, and the ministries of the respective countries, the SEAICRN is a 17 -
site network in Thail and, Vietnam, and Indonesia addressing issues of emerging influenza viruses and 
other emerging infections.  A second five -year contract for NIAID support and collaboration is currently 
being negotiated.  The intent of the collaboration is to establish and ma intain an independent clinical 
research network of importance to the region, to the U.S., and to the global community.  
The Mexican Emerging Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network  (La RED) is a multisite collaboration 
between NIAID and the Mexico Mi nistry of Health that began in September 2009 to conduct clinically 
relevant and high -quality research on emerging infectious diseases.  The five sites in Mexico City include 
two pediatric sites.  Three studies are currently enrolling  participants . Future sh ort-term strategic goals 
include expansion to 1 –2 sites outside of Mexico City and the start of an additional flu study. The long -
term strategic plan is to promote sustainability and capacity of La Red.   
Phidisa  is an HIV/AIDS research collaboration with HHS through the NIAID, the U.S. Department of 
Defense, and the South African Medical Health Services (SAMHS).  Launched in 2003, this six -site clinical 
research project focuses on the management and treatment of HIV infection in the uniformed members 
 236 of the  South African National Defense Force (SANDF) and their dependents, with over 6,000 enrolled 
patients.  Phidisa’s mission is to generate evidence through clinical research to inform policy and 
improve medical care to benefit members of the SANDF and their f amilies.  Phidisa has recently 
expressed an interest in building capacity within the SAMHS to conduct research on other diseases of 
critical importance to military force preparedness.  
Indo -U.S. Vaccine Action Program  (VAP) was initiated under the Gandhi -Reagan Science and Technology 
Agreement signed in 1985, and implemented in 1987.  The VAP is co -managed by the Indian Department 
of Biotechnology and the NIAID and supports a broad spectrum of research activities aimed at improving 
vaccines for diseases of im portance to India and of interest to the U.S. Diseases and topics funded under 
the VAP include malaria, TB, dengue, immune enhancement, hepatitis C, rabies, the genetics of 
respiratory syncytial virus, and vaccine development for rotavirus and HIV. While t he VAP will continue 
to promote translational research and support individual projects proposed by Indian and U.S. 
collaborating scientists, it will also expand into new scientific areas, such as understanding human 
immunology and the development of novel vaccine -related technologies.   
  
 237 Minority Health and Health Disparities   
Scientific and technological discoveries throughout the 20th century have improved the overall health of 
the nation and generated hope for happier, healthier, and longer lives for all . However, some segments 
of the U.S. population continue to experience elevated morbidity and mortality, disproportionate 
incidence of disease and disability, and adverse outcomes in cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
HIV/AIDS, infant mortality, and  certain other conditions.  These disparities in health are most visible in 
racial/ethnic minority groups, individuals from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, and 
people living in medically underserved areas, including  some  rural communities.  
NIH has devoted considerable resources to understanding  the root causes of health disparities.  As a 
result of these efforts, a complex web of interconnected and overlapping factors (i.e., biological, 
behavioral, environmental, and societal) have begun to be identified . For example, poverty and lack of 
education correlate with poor health and lower life expectancy; moreover, discrimination based on 
racial, ethnic, and linguistic differences in the U.S. not only triggers biological stress, but also creates a 
barrier to accessing high -quality health care.  In addition, some groups are genetically susceptible to 
certain diseases, and when this inherited biological vulnerability combines with adverse social and/or 
environmental factors (e.g., poor diet, pollution, e conomic stress), these groups exhibit poorer health 
outcomes.  Confronting the interrelated factors that contribute to the existence of health disparities  is at 
the heart of the vigorous efforts NIH is undertaking to make advances in science that will trans late into 
effective prevention and treatment interventions.  
Health disparities affecting racial/ethnic minorities and other medically underserved populations are 
seen across a broad spectrum of diseases and conditions.  They represent one of the most persis tent 
public health challenges in the U.S.  Research findings consistently have shown that many health 
disparity populations also are less likely than most of the majority population to receive needed health 
care services, including clinically necessary proc edures.  Health disparities frequently are associated with 
differences in socioeconomic status (SES) and tend to diminish significantly and, in a few cases, 
disappear when SES factors are controlled.  Nevertheless, some racial/ethnic disparities remain even 
after adjusting for SES differences and other factors related to health care access.  
In keeping with its role as the nation’s  primary  steward of biomedical and behavioral research, NIH is 
firmly committed to eliminating health disparities in the U.S.  Since  the issuance of the Black and 
Minority Health Report in 1985, NIH has incorporated the goals of improved health for all Americans and 
the elimination of health disparities in its support of biomedical and behavioral research, research 
training, research c apacity -building, outreach, and research and health information dissemination.  Many 
of these activities are multidisciplinary collaborations involving several NIH ICs or NIH and non -federal 
organizations.  These efforts not only have advanced health dispari ties research, but also have facilitated 
communications among stakeholders and moved the field forward exponentially during the last 25 
years.  
 238 Throughout its history, NHLBI has been a leader in conducting and supporting research to eliminate 
health disparities that exist between various segments of the U.S. population.  The Institute has not only 
initiated research projects with significant minority participation to compare health status between 
various populations, but also has given high priority to  programs that focus exclusively on minority 
health issues.  NHLBI epidemiology programs, for example, include several major studies of heart disease 
in minority populations, support for components of the NHANES that track prevalence and risk factors of 
cardiovascular and lung diseases by race and ethnicity, and the National Longitudinal Mortality Study 
that analyzes socioeconomic, demographic, occupational, and racial differentials in U.S. mortality.  
Genetic epidemiologic research includes studies of the ge netics  of hypertension in populations of West 
Africa origin, salt sensitivity in people of Chinese ethnicity, and metabolic traits in Mexican Americans.  
Understanding racial differences in blood pressure control is an area of major interest for NHLBI and 
clinical trials of therapies have consistently included strong representation of minority participants.  
Understanding the relationships between heart disease and stress induced by environmental, social, or 
discriminatory influences is another focus of resea rch efforts.  In the area of lung diseases, considerable 
effort has been directed toward understanding the disproportionate burden of asthma among urban 
black and Hispanic children and identifying culturally appropriate strategies to help them achieve good 
symptom control.  The NHLBI research program in blood diseases has, since 1972, supported an 
extensive array of studies to understand the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease, identify better 
approaches to its diagnosis and treatment, and prevent complica tions.  
Research on aging continues to document the existence of persistent health differentials among older 
racial and ethnic groups in the United States, both before and after age 65. NIA remains committed to 
addressing health disparities and inequities w ith initiatives supported in partnership with the NIMHD  as 
well as with other Institutes and Centers. O ne of the Institute’s most visible and focused efforts to build 
the national research infrastructure for reducing and eliminating health disparities is  the Resource 
Centers for Minority Aging Research  (RCMAR) program, the mission of which includes establishing a 
research mentoring mechanism in minority health and health disparities, enhancing professional 
diversity in minority health research, evaluating /developing measurement tools tailored to minority and 
marginalized population groups, and developing strategies for recruiting and retaining research 
participants from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds.406 Another program, The Healthy Aging in 
Neighborh oods of Diversity across the Life Span  study, is an interdisciplinary, community -based, 
prospective longitudinal epidemiologic study examining the influences of race and SES on the 
development of age -related health disparities among socioeconomically diver se African Americans and 
whites in Baltimore. This study  began in 2004 and  is ongoing.407  
Many diseases and disorders within the NIDDK mission area disproportionately affect minority 
populations.  Therefore, the Institute supports a robust research portfolio  to reduce health disparities 
and improve the health of all people.  For example, related to type 2 diabetes, the HEALTHY408 study

408 Middle -School Based Primary Prevention Trial of T ype 2 Diabetes (HEALTHY) .  For more information, see 
http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00458029 .  
 239 tested a middle school -based intervention for reducing risk factors for type 2 diabetes in youth; the 
TODAY409 clinical trial is t esting different treatment strategies in youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes; 
and the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study  is following  DPP participants to determin e the 
durability of the interventions in preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes, and how the interventions 
affect  the development of CVD  and other complications of diabetes.  Approximately 30 -90 percent of 
participants in these studies are from minority grou ps disproportionately burdened by type 2 diabetes.  
Addition ally, the NIDDK supports the Type 2 Diabetes  Genes Consortium to identify type 2 diabetes risk 
genes in minority populations.  
Toward the goal of building and sustaining a biomedical, behavioral, cl inical, and social science research 
pipeline focused on NIDDK mission areas, the NIDDK supports the Short -Term Education Program for 
Underrepresented Persons (STEP -UP).  STEP -UP provides research education grants to institutions to 
coordinate high school an d undergraduate programs that provide eligible students with 10 -12 weeks of 
summer research experience and training opportunities.  STEP -UP seeks to increase the participation of 
students from backgrounds underrepresented in biomedical research, including i ndividuals from 
disadvantaged backgrounds, individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and individuals 
with disabilities.  Additionally, the NIDDK has established a Network of Minority Research Investigators  
(NMRI) to increase the number of minority researchers and to increase research on h ealth disparities . 
The goal of the NMRI is to foster a communication network of current and potential biomedical research 
investigators and technical personnel from traditionally under -served communities.  This Network is led 
by the NIDDK’s Office of Minority Health Research Coordination, and currently has approximately 200 
members.  
The investigator -initiated research project, Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Early Life Risk Factors for 
Childhood Obesity, was des igned to identify obesity risk factors during pregnancy, infancy, and early 
childhood. It found that Black and Hispanic children have a higher prevalence than white children of a 
range of risk factors for obesity by pre -school age, including maternal depre ssion, early initiation of solid 
food consumption, and intake of sugar -sweetened beverages. The results suggest that there is a need 
for interventions in very early life to reduce disparities in childhood and adult obesity. The article 
reporting these find ings was named as one of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Most Influential 
Research Articles of 2010.  
The NIDDK -led Look AHEAD clinical trial is determining whether a lifestyle intervention designed to 
promote weight loss can improve health outcomes, including prevention of heart disease, in overweight 
or obese people with type 2 diabetes. For the first 4 years of the study, participants in the lifestyle 
intervention group lost significantly more weight and better maintained their lost weight than thos e in 
the control group; they also had improved fitness, glucose control, blood pressure, and HDL cholesterol 
with less use of medication.  The trial is planned to continue for up to 13.5 years, and longer -term 
results will determine whether these effects w ill lead to reduced rates of cardiovascular disease and 
death.  
                                                 
409 Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY).  For more information, see 
http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00081328 .  
 240 NIDDK -supported researchers have found that African Americans with two copies of certain variants in 
the APOL1 gene are at increased risk of developing kidney disease, particularly focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and kidney disease related to infection with the HIV. These findings explain 
nearly all of the excess risk of non -diabetic kidney failure in African Americans, and have important 
implications for understanding the differ ences in kidney disease risk across populations.  NIMHD is 
collaborating with NIDDK regarding future research directions in FSGS and the APOL1 gene.  
The NIMHD Centers of Excellence (COE) program has created a research platform to advance scientific 
knowled ge and develop interventions that address diseases affecting health disparity populations.  They 
also provide a focal point for establishing partnerships with other institutions or federal agencies 
interested in health disparities research.  For example, NIM HD and the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) have launched the "Environmental Health Disparities Initiative," which examines the complex 
relationship between health disparities and the natural, built, social, and policy environments.  The 
principal obje ctive of this collaborative research effort is to generate innovative approaches to alleviate 
environmentally driven health disparities and improve access to healthy environments for vulnerable 
populations.  
In a recent study, the NIMHD COE at Arizona State  University explored when it is most efficacious to 
expose Mexican heritage youth to drug abuse prevention programs. Implementing the Keepin' it REAL 
drug prevention program in middle school (but not elementary school) decreased the use of alcohol, 
cigaret tes, marijuana, and inhalants by Mexican heritage youth.  
A diabetes epidemic is facing the U.S. Virgin Islands, yet little is known regarding the cultural context 
relevant to self -management of the disease in this U.S. territory. COE researchers in the Vi rgin Islands 
conducted in -home interviews of the local population, supplemented by a self -administered 
questionnaire and hemoglobin A1c testing, to characterize self -management knowledge, attitudes, and 
behaviors among patients living with diabetes. Severa l recurrent themes emerged from this study: 1) 
cultural nuances shaped perspectives on self -management, 2) culturally -specific challenges were 
barriers to effective self -management, 3) medical homes  were rarely viewed as the primary source of 
education an d support, and 4) fear of largely motivated or stalled self -management practices. This study 
highlights the need for culturally -tailored measures and interventions to address the specific needs 
within this population.  
Stroke affects certain ethnic and mino rity populations at a disproportionately higher rate than non -
Hispanic whites.  African Americans are at a higher risk of stroke than whites, and while incidence is 
decreasing in whites, the same downward trend is not occurring in blacks.  Stroke incidence i s also higher 
in Mexican Americans compared with whites. Socioeconomic status only accounts for a portion of these 
disparities, suggest ing that biological, cultural or geographic factors also may play a role. In certain areas 
of the southeastern U.S. , stroke mortality is significantly higher than in the rest of the population. The 
"stroke belt" has a 40 percent higher rate , while the "stroke buckle" has a 20 percent higher rate.  NINDS 
supports research aimed at better defining stroke risk, incidence an d outcomes in the  U.S. and among 
different sub -populations. Collection of population -based data helps identify and explain health 
disparities in stroke, and inform the development of preventive interventions that target high risk 
 241 populations.  For example, in the  Reasons  for Geographic  and Racial  Differences  in Stroke  study, 
investigators are exploring the geographical and racial influences on stroke risk in a cohort of about 
30,000 individuals, about half of whom live in the “stroke belt” region of the southeastern US . This study 
has produced nearly 100 publications that have led to better understanding disparities in stroke in the 
US. Data generated from this study continue to help researchers pinpoint reasons that the stroke rate is 
higher in this regi on, and among African Americans, and to develop targeted strategies for intervention.  
NINR supports a range of activities related to eliminating health disparities and promoting health equity 
in underrepresented populations, and to training new investigato rs underrepresented in the research 
community. NINR has recently sponsored research initiatives to reduce health disparities in minority and 
underserved children, and to promote health in racial and ethnic minority males. Recent studies have 
explored such topics as: risk factors for preterm labor and birth in African -American women and 
improving breast feeding in urban low -income mothers. In 2011, NINR released a Spanish -language 
version of its palliative care brochure to increase awareness of this comprehe nsive treatment for pain 
and other symptoms of serious illness in the Hispanic community.   
The NCRR  Research Centers in Minority Institutions Translational Research Network conducts multi -site 
clinical and translational research on diseases that disproport ionately affect minority populations, such 
as cancer, diabetes, renal disease, infant mortality, HIV/AIDS, and cardiovascular diseases.410  
ORWH supports trans -NIH efforts to promote research on health disparities and minority women’s 
health.  The objectives of the NIH strategic plan on women’s health and sex differences research, Moving 
into the Future with New Dimensions and Strategies: A Vision for 2020 for Women’s Health Research, 
encompass a broad vision of disease -specific research in wome n’s health.  The goal is to better 
understand the role of sex and gender differences in disease risk, vulnerability, progression, and 
outcomes for diverse populations throughout life.  
Women from low SES backgrounds, especially from African American populati ons, are particularly 
susceptible to adverse pregnancy -related outcomes because of a high prevalence rate of obesity. The 
Weight Management in Obese Pregnant Underserved African American Women project, which is 
sponsored by ORWH, is testing a novel lifesty le intervention to help obese socioeconomically 
disadvantaged African American women achieve healthy weight control during and after pregnancy.  
Epidemiology research funded by NEI, such as the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, the Multi -ethnic 
Pediatric Eye Di sease Study, and the Chinese American Eye Study, has pinpointed areas of health 
disparity in eye disease, especially glaucoma, which is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among 
Hispanic and African Americans, and diabetic eye disease. A genetics s tudy comparing glaucoma in West 
African and American populations is pioneering new genetics techniques that require fewer patients for 
each analysis. Not only is the prevalence of glaucoma four times higher in African Americans than 
                                                 
410 On December 23, 2011, President Barack Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112 -
74). As part of thi s legislation, the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) is dissolved and the National 
Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NC ATS) is established. Science Education Partnership Awards (SEPA) is 
now part of the NIH Office of the Director, Di vision of Program Coordination, Planning and Strategic Initiatives, 
Office of Research Infrastructure Programs.  
 242 Caucasians, the risk of  blindness is up to 10 times higher. The African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation 
Study  explores racial variations in optic nerve structure and biomechanics among glaucoma patients of 
African descent who are at increased risk for glaucoma relative to Caucas ians with similar intraocular 
pressures. The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network conducts trials in community clinics that 
serve a diverse complement of patients with diabetic retinopathy.  
Oral health in the U.S. has improved considerably, but n ot for all Americans. Chronic dental and oral 
conditions remain among the most common health problems that afflict disadvantaged and 
underserved communities. Among those with lower levels of access to dental care are the poor, 
members of minority groups, t he elderly, the very young, and people living in sparsely populated rural 
areas where dentists are few.  
The NIDCR Health Disparities Research Program supports a full spectrum of research studies that 
identify practical, sustainable approaches so that more disadvantaged Americans may experience good 
oral health.  The Centers of Research to Reduce Oral Health Disparities are conducting several clinical 
trials aimed at reducing early childhood caries, improving the oral health of disadvantaged pregnant 
women, a nd increasing early detection of oral cancer.  Data from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES),411 1999 –2004, indicate that the prevalence of decayed or filled teeth is 
more prevalent in U.S. children (ages 2 –4 and 6 –8) who are Mexican  American or Black compared with 
their non -Hispanic white counterparts. Nearly 70 percent of Mexican American children aged 6 –8 have 
or have had decay compared with nearly 50 percent of non -Hispanic white children.  Disparities in the 
prevalence of untreated tooth decay persist into adulthood, with the prevalence of tooth decay being 
nearly twice as great for racial/ethnic minorities compared to non -Hispanic whites.  
The NIEHS Partnerships for Environmental Public Health (PEPH) program focuses on rese arch into the 
risk of increased health burden in populations with inequities in environmental exposure and disease.  
NIMHD and NIBIB created a joint program, the Development and Translation of Medical Technologies 
that Reduce Health Disparities Initiative,  which supports the development and translation of medical 
technologies aimed at reducing disparities in healthcare access and health outcomes.  Technologies 
targeted by this initiative are remote diagnosis and monitoring; sensors for point -of-care diagnosi s; 
devices for in -home monitoring; portable diagnostic and therapeutic systems; devices that integrate 
diagnosis and treatment; diagnostics or treatments that do not require special training; devices that can 
operate in low -resource environments; non -invas ive technologies for diagnosis and treatment; and an 
integrated, automated system to assess or monitor a specific condition.  
NIMH has launched an administrative supplement program to support advanced research 
experiences for outstanding early career physic ians and medical students from diverse backgrounds.  
As outlined in the 2008 National Advisory Mental Health Council Workgroup on Research Training ,412

 243 NIMH encourages the recruitment, training, and retention of outstanding physician -scientists from 
diverse b ackgrounds.  The purpose of this program is to improve the diversity of the mental health 
research workforce by supporting and recruiting early stage investigators from groups that have 
been shown to be underrepresented in scientific disciplines relevant to  mental health research on a 
national basis.  
NIH outreach initiatives encompass a wide range of endeavors, including communications and education 
programs, partnerships and collaborations with public and private organizations, and enhancement and 
expansion  of access to information and services among disadvantaged populations.  Outreach initiatives 
span many forms of activity, from creation of a new slogan to promote early stroke awareness, to 
efforts to disseminate science -based oral health information to sp ecific populations, to health 
information outreach initiatives targeting high school students, to efforts to disseminate science -based 
information on obesity and diabetes, and to a new, decade -long program devoted to environmental 
public health.  They also address diverse stakeholder audiences, including students, patients, health care 
providers, public health educators and officials, policymakers, professional and patient advocacy 
organizations, and community -based groups.  Information and interventions may target specific diseases 
and conditions such as HIV/AIDS,  obesity,  diabetes, digestive diseases,  kidney disease,  and Sudden 
Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), or they may be oriented toward a particular health disparities population 
subgroup, or both.  These inc lude a variety of NIH health information Web sites, several of which are 
available in Spanish .413 
NIH outreach also is tailored to meet the needs of specific groups or those who provide treatment or 
services to a group.  Science -based oral health information disseminated by two NIH programs illustrates 
this point.  A Spanish -language Web site increases access to science -based oral health information 
among Hispanics.  The site was tested in two cities to ensure that it is understandable, credible, and 
attractive to the intended audience of Spanish -dominant and bilingual Hispanics from different 
countries of origin and with varying levels of education.  Dentists, dental hygienists, and caregivers have 
learned how to better serve the oral health needs of people with developmental disabilities through an 
online continuing education (CE) program called Practical Oral Care for People with Developmental 
Disabilities.  The modules have proven so popular that NIH extended the CE credit through 2011.  
The National Diabetes Edu cation Program (NDEP [ http://ndep.nih.gov/ ]) and the National Kidney 
Disease Education Program (NKDEP [ http://nkdep.nih.gov/ ]) disseminate evidence -based educational 
materials on di abetes and kidney disease, respectively.  For example, the NDEP encourages people to 
take “small steps” to prevent type 2 diabetes.  The NKDEP encourages African American families to 
discuss kidney disease at family reunions, and also provides tools and reso urces for health  care 
providers to help coordinate care and improve patient outcomes for kidney disease.  Both programs 
tailor materials for minority groups at high risk.  The Weig ht-control Information Network ( WIN 
[http://win.niddk.nih.gov/ ]) provides up -to-date, science -based information on weight control, obesity, 
physical activity, and related nutritional issues.  WIN provides tailored information to high -risk groups,

American women.  
In the spring of 2011, the NIH Associate Director of Research on Women’s Health  was the spokesperson 
for nation -wide radio media tour entitled, “Understanding Family Health History/Preventing type 2 
Diabetes in Women with a History of Gestational Diabetes.”  The goal of the tour was  to raise awareness 
of risks and prevention strategies for gestational diabetes melli tus (GDM).  It reached over one million 
listeners and pieces were aired on over 200 stations and network affiliates.  The tour focused on radio 
stations and geographic areas with large minority populations, including statewide stations in North 
Carolina and Tennessee, and the top -rated stations in northern California; St. Louis, Missouri; Dallas -Ft. 
Worth, Texas; and Denver, Colorado.

Centers of Excellence  
 
Alzheimer’s Disease Centers   
Establishment of the Alzheimer’s Disease Centers  
Based on concerns about the enormity of the problems posed by Alzheimer’s disease, Congress directed 
NIH to foster further research related to Alzheimer's disease (AD)  in the Public Health Service Act of 
1984 . Under section 445 of this act, Congress author ized the establishment of the  NIH Alzheimer’s 
Disease Centers (ADCs) program . (42 U.S.C. 285e -2). The first ADCs  were established through NIH 
funding  in the mid -1980s in response to the congressional directive, information on AD emerging from 
the work of N IH grantees and other researchers, and the prospect of a medical and social crisis triggered 
by an explosion of AD cases due to population aging . The principal objectives of the ADC program are to 
conduct cutting edge basic, clinical, translational, and so cial/behavioral research; train the next 
generation of researchers; and provide information to the public about research findings, access to 
support services, and opportunities to participate in research.  Much of the research takes place through 
multicente r cooperative studies to better understand the causes and effects of AD and to develop and 
test new interventions for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of AD and other age -related 
neurodegenerative diseases.  
How the ADCs Function Within the NIH Fram ework  
NIH currently funds 27  ADCs (see Table 4 -1). Funding for the ADCs comes from NIA through the P30 
(center core grant) and P50 (specialized center grant) mechanisms for five years; centers compete 
through a peer review process for additional funding.  New applicants for ADC funding compete with 
existing grantees.  
Description of Disease or Condition  
AD is the most common form of dementia among older people.  It is an age -related, irreversible brain 
disorder that develops over many years.  In the earliest s tage, people experience memory loss or other , 
usually mild,  behavioral or cognitive changes; these are sometimes mistaken for changes that may occur 
during  the normal aging  process . As the disease progresses  however , these symptoms gradually lead to 
dement ia, a condition characterized by marked memory loss accompanied by behavior and personality 
changes.  The disease also leads to a decline in other cognitive abilities (such as decision -making and 
language skills) and eventually to an inability to recognize family and friends and  severe mental decline . 
These losses are related to the breakdown of the connections between neurons in the brain and the 
eventual death of many of these cells.  For most people who develop  AD, symptoms first appear after 
age 65.  AD and other dementing disorders are caused by disease processes that affect the brain, 
 246 although age -related brain and body changes also can affect the timing and progression of AD and other 
dementias.  
AD probably has no single cause.  The most important k nown risk factors for the development of AD are 
age and family history, although education, diet, and environment appear to  play a role.  Scientists also 
are finding evidence that some of the risk factors for heart disease and stroke —such as high blood 
pres sure, high cholesterol, and low levels of the vitamin folate —might increase the risk for AD.  
Increasing e vidence also suggests  that physical, mental, and social activities may help to delay the onset 
of AD.  Although scientists have learned a great deal abo ut AD, they still do not know what causes the 
disease and have not identified a cure . 
Burden of Illness  
Recent estimates from a nationally representative sample in the Aging, Demographics, and Memory 
Study (part of the ongoing NIH -supported Health and Reti rement Study) suggest that one in seven 
Americans age 72 or older has dementia and about 2.4 million have AD.  Other investigators, using 
projections from community -based studies, estimate that 5.1 million Americans ages 65 or older have 
AD. Despite the dif fering methodologies and results of their studies, experts agree that the number of 
people with AD will increase significantly if current U.S. demographic  trends continue and no 
effective prevention methods emerge.  Our aging society makes AD an especially c ritical issue because 
the number of people with the disease doubles for every five -year age interval beyond age 65.  The U.S. 
Census Bureau estimates that the size of the population ages 65 and older will increase to about 72 
million people in the next 25 y ears.  Moreover, the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population 
consists of people 85 years of age or older.  
Scope of NIH Activities: Research and Programmatic  
The ADC program provides infrastructure and core resources to enhance ongoing research by bringing 
together basic biomedical, behavioral  and social , and clinical scientists to study the causes, progression, 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AD and to improve health care delivery.  ADCs also foster the 
development of new research approaches  and provide training opportunities for research fellows and 
junior faculty interested in conducting interdisciplinary AD research.  By pooling resources and working 
cooperatively with other ADCs, these centers have produced research findings and developed resources 
that would have been impossible for investigators working alone.  
The ADC program includes two types of centers.  NIH requires all ADCs to contain administrative, clinical, 
data management and statistics, education and information transfer, and neu ropathology components, 
known as “cores,” and some Centers support other cores providing specialized resources such as 
neuroimaging or genetic data.  The eleven Alzheimer’s Disease Core Centers provide investigators within 
and outside the ADC program with a ccess to the broad spectrum of ADC resources, while 16 Alzheimer’s 
Disease Research Centers conduct research projects in addition to providing core resources.  Some 
Centers also support satellite diagnostic and treatment clinics to help recruit from underre presented 
group s.  
 247 Resources shared among ADCs include brain and specimen banks at each center, which consist of well -
characterized specimens collected under standardized protocols; ADCs have provided biological samples 
from patients with AD for hundreds of non -ADC funded pr ojects.  
A major resource shared by the ADCs is the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease (NCRAD) at 
Indiana University, which collects and stores blood, DNA, and cell lines from families with several 
members affected by  AD and from unaffected c ontrol participants.  NCRAD also stores well -documented 
phenotypic data, including age and gender . The repository is part of the NIH Alzheimer’s Disease 
Genetics Initiative, which was established to identify genetic risk factors for late -onset AD, and the 
recently funded Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), which conducts large -scale whole -
genome studies on AD.  The ADGC itself maintains one of the largest collections of samples available for 
genome -wide association studies of Alzheimer’s disease t hat are being used  to identify the susceptibility 
and protective genes influencing the onset and progression of late -onset disease.  These samples are 
especially valuable because of the rich associated clinical data also available for  each participant .  
The ADCs have helped create additional collaborative research resources or projects such as the 
National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center, the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study, and the 
Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.  Descriptions of these and  other efforts are provided in the 
following section . 
Much of the important progress in AD research in the U.S. during the past 28 years stems from research 
conducted at or resources provided by the ADCs.  ADC scientists have conducted a significant amount  of 
the research on protein processing related to plaque and tangle formation  in the brain , hallmarks of 
Alzheimer’s disease.  ADC researchers also have identified the common properties of the abnormal 
proteins associated with several neurodegenerative disea ses. In recent years, ADC researchers have 
evaluated cognitive changes associated with normal aging and the transitions to mild cognitive 
impairment (early difficulties with thinking and remembering) and dementia.  With that has come a 
more precise understa nding of the timing of various types of cognitive changes as well as the 
development of better ways to measure and evaluate those changes.  They also have identified factors 
that contribute to changes in cognitive abilities such as social and physical activ ity.  
Currently, many ADCs are carrying out important studies relating changes in brain structure to the 
clinical stages of AD.  For these studies, researchers are examining patients enrolled in the clinical cores, 
brain imaging supported by imaging cores, and autopsy evaluations from the  neuropathology cores.  ADC 
researchers  also are examining relationships and commonalities between AD and cerebrovascular 
disease or other neurodegenerative diseases as well as contributions of co -existing non -neurological 
conditions that occur in people with AD.  In addition, the ADCs are exploring commonalities between AD 
and other dementias, including Parkinson’s disease dementia.  In this regard, collaborations are 
underway with the NINDS -supported Udall Parkinson’s Disease Centers to examine many overlapping 
scientific and clinical issues.  
Another major objective for the ADCs is to recruit minority and ethnically diverse research participants 
for AD research.  To achieve this goal, NIH created the Satellite Diagnostic and Tre atment Clinics and 
 248 linked them to the ADCs.  Currently there are 18 active  Satellite Clinics  recruiting African American, 
Hispanic, Native American, and Asian participants.  National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center data now 
show that approximately 20 percent  of those enrolled in the ADCs are minorities.  Also, the ADCs 
conduct research related to specific minority concerns in cooperation with the NIH -supported Research 
Centers on Minority Aging Research.  
All ADCs have Education and Information Transfer Cores (EITCs) that provide research training for new 
investigators, as well as outreach to the public, including caregivers.  EITC efforts also have been 
redefined recently to facilitate participant recruitment for large scale, national projects such as the NIA 
Genetics Initiative, Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 
and other clinical trials and initiatives.  Collaborations include ongoing interactions with organizations  
such as the Alzheimer’s Association, Administr ation on Aging, and NIH’s Alzheimer’s Disease Education 
and Referral Center.  The ADCs pay special attention to issues of cultural sensitivity and, where 
appropriate, structure their information to effectively reach minority populations, including non -nativ e 
English spea kers  people . 
NIH Funding for FY 2010 and FY 2011  
NIH funding for the ADCs was $50. 55 million in FY 2010 and $49.76 million in FY 2011  for non -ARRA 
(regular appropriations) , and $10,000  in FY 2010 for ARRA appropriations . 
FY 2010 and FY 2011 P rogress Report  
Programmatic Activities and Outcomes  
Programmatic accomplishments for the ADCs include the following examples.  
 National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC).  In 1999, NIH established NACC to facilitate 
collaborative research and standardize procedures among the ADCs.  NACC developed and maintains 
a large database of standardized clinical and neuropathological research data collected from each 
ADC.  This database provides a valuable resource to qualified research scientists for both exploratory 
and explanatory AD research.  The data provided by NACC support large studies that use patient 
samples from ethnically, racially and geographically diverse populations and multiple ADCs.  A 
minimum data set (MDS) of 67 variables collected from th e ADCs contains data on more than 74,000 
subjects enrolled since 1984.  A much richer longitudinal uniform data set (UDS) (725 variables) has 
been collected from over 25,000 subjects enrolled since 2005.  Data collected by NACC is freely 
available for all sc ientists to use in research studies.  NACC itself has funded 30 
collaborative  multicenter studies and junior investigator awards to use NACC data  and nearly 200 
additional research studies  funded by other sources have used NACC data in their research.  
 Alzhe imer’s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS). The ADCS is the large clinical trials consortium that is 
the cornerstone of NIH’s major AD clinical trials effort. The consortium expanded from the ADCs and 
now includes sites throughout the U.S. and Canada. All of the current ADCs are performance sites 
for the ADCS. The clinical research outcomes of ADCs are inextricable from the outcomes of ADCS. 
 249 NIH developed the ADCS to advance research on therapeutics that might be useful for treating 
patients with AD, to improv e cognition, slow the rate of decline, delay the appearance of AD, or 
ameliorate behavioral symptoms. In particular, the ADCS focuses on interventions that industry 
might not develop, including agents that lack patent protection or are under patent protect ion but 
are marketed for other indications, as well as novel compounds developed by individuals, academic 
institutions, and drug discovery units. Moreover, the ADCS mission also includes the design of new 
instruments for use in clinical studies and the dev elopment of novel and innovative approaches to 
clinical study design and AD clinical study analys es.  
In 2012, the ADCS renewal application will be submitted and reviewed.  Building on recent exciting 
discoveries from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging In itiative, the ADCS will focus on new trial 
approaches using imaging and other biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma to identify 
participants with AD pathology and to track disease progression and treatment response.  ADCS 
investigators will also plac e an increased emphasis on prevention studies, particularly in at -risk but 
presymptomatic individuals.  
 Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).  Most ADCs participate in ADNI, which is an 
innovative public -private partnership that is examining the potential of serial MRI, PET, or other 
biomarkers to measure earlier and with greater sensitivity the development and progression of mild 
cognitive impai rment and AD.  As is true of the ADCS, the activities and outcomes of ADNI are 
inextricable from those of the ADCs.  ADNI completed the first enrollment phase in August 2007 and 
now is monitoring the 823 participants using MRI and PET imaging and laboratory and cognitive 
tests.  This will generate a comprehensive database that will serve as an important public resource to 
spur further research.  Already, many of the tools and methods developed by the study are fueling 
similar efforts in Japan, the European Unio n, and Australia.  
In 2009, Recovery Act funding enabled the ADNI study to move into the “ADNI GO” phase.  The ADNI 
GO research effort is the first of its kind to focus on participants who exhibit the earliest signs of 
memory loss in mild cognitive impairmen t, thought to be a precursor to AD.  While the ADNI GO 
project work continues, the overall ADNI effort is rapidly moving into a third phase, known as “ADNI 
2,” which has built  upon the successes of earlier ADNI phases to identify the earliest signs of 
Alzhe imer’s disease.  
Research Activities and Outcomes  
Since the establishment of the ADC program in 1984, investigators have published thousands of 
research papers on all aspects of AD and related disorders.  Topics have ranged from the disease’s 
biology to its  family and societal impact, as well as many studies of diagnosis and treatment.  
Research accomplishments include the following important recent studies carried out by ADC scientists, 
which highlight research on biomarkers and AD recently carried out by s everal centers.  These studies 
are only a few examples from a wide spectrum of research studies conducted by the ADCs.  
 250  Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers.6 NIH-supported researchers, including  investigators with the 
Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative,  established a method and standard for testing levels of 
two candidate biomarkers for AD —tau and beta amyloid proteins.  The researchers now have 
correlated levels of these proteins in CSF with changes in cognition over time and determined that 
changes in t hese two protein levels in CSF may signal the onset of mild AD.  This is a significant step 
forward in developing a test to help diagnose the early stages of AD sooner and more accurately and 
to begin treatment that could delay the development of more sever e AD symptoms.   
 New Clinical and Pathological Diagnostic Guidelines.  The identification of strong candidate 
biomarkers for AD has facilitated the first revision of the clinical diagnostic criteria for AD in 27 years 
(through a joint effort of the NIA and t he Alzheimer’s Association).  The update offers a new 
paradigm for Alzheimer’s, covering the disease as it gradually progresses over many years, from the 
earliest preclinical, pre -symptomatic phase through mild cognitive impairment to advanced 
dementia.  The new guidelines also address the use of imaging and biomarkers to determine 
whether changes in the brain and body fluids are due to AD.  A separate update addresses diagnosis 
at autopsy and will help neuropathologists characterize Alzheimer’s -related brain changes at death 
in people who have been diagnosed with dementia and those who have not yet shown clinical 
symptoms, taking into account that the disease process may begin a decade or two before clinical 
symptoms such as memory loss appear.  
 New AD Genes.  In the largest genome -wide association study, or GWAS, ever conducted in 
Alzheimer's research, ADGC investigators confirmed that  the gene variant BIN 1 affects development 
of late -onset Alzheimer’s, and identified genetic variants significant for Alzheimer’ s at EPHA 1, 
MS4A, CD2AP, and CD33.414 The genes identified by this study may implicate pathways involved in 
inflammation, movement of proteins within cells, and lipid transport as being important in the 
disease process.  
 Beta Amyloid Production and Clearance . In Alzheimer's disease, a protein fragment called beta -
amyloid accumulates at abnormally high levels in the brain.  ADC investigators recently found that in 
the most common, late -onset form of Alzheimer's disease, beta -amyloid is produced in the brain at 
a normal rate but is not cleared, or removed from the brain, efficiently.  In addition to improving the 
understanding of what pathways are most important in development of Alzheimer's pathology, 
these findings may one day lead to improved biomarker measures  for early diagnosis as well as a 
new approach to treating the disease.  
Recommendations for Improving the Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Outcomes of the ADCs  
Evaluation Plans  
The National Advisory Council on Aging evaluates and makes recommendations for th e ADC program 
every four years.  The next evaluation is scheduled for 2013.

 251 Future Directions  
NIH plans for the ADCs to continue to emphasize research related to  the transition from normal aging to 
mild cognitive impairment and to full -blown AD, as well as on studies of the overlap between AD and 
other neurodegenerative diseases  instead of concentrating on  late-stage AD .  In addition, the ADCs will 
continue to sea rch for biomarkers that predict cognitive decline and diagnose cognitive impairment and 
dementia .

 253 Older Americans Independence Centers of Excellence   
Establishment of the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Ind ependence Centers  
In 1955, the Surgeon General of the United States established five Geriatric Research and Training 
Centers to advance research on the health care problems of the elderly and train future academic 
leaders in the field of geriatrics.  In 1989, Congress passed  legislation that redesignated the se Geriatric 
Research and Training Centers as the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Centers (OAICs) 
to honor former Florida Senator and Representative Claude Denson Pepper for his efforts to promote 
the health and well -being of older Americans.  Section 445A of  the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
285e -3) authorizes the OAICs  to increase scientific knowledge leading to better ways to maintain or 
restore independence in older adults (see Table 4 -2). 
How OAICs Function within the NIH Framework  
NIH funding for the OAICs comes from NIA through a center grant mechanism (P30).  The ultimate goal 
of the OAIC program is to translate research on aging to applications and interventions that increase or 
maintain independence for older persons.  NIH currently targets a tot al of 12 OAICs for funding (see 
Table 4 -2).  
As Centers of Excellence in geriatrics research and training, the OAICs provide intellectual leadership in 
geriatrics research, encouraging and facilitating multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary collaborations  in 
basic, translational, and clinical research relevant to the health and independence of older persons.  In 
addition, each OAIC includes a Research Career Development Core to provide research training and 
career development opportunities in geriatrics and  related fields.  
Description of Disease or Condition  
Age is a primary risk factor for many disabling diseases and conditions.  However human aging is a highly 
variable process; there is no single disease or condition that is synonymous with aging. Understanding 
the process of aging is necessary to promote the health and well -bing of older adults. Aging research 
focuses on a range of conditions, including geriatric syndromes (e.g., involuntary weight loss, dizziness, 
and urinary incontinence) and diseases and disorders that are more common among older adults such 
as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, stroke, and loss of sensory funct ion.  
Burden of Illness  
Currently, over 40 million Americans are older than 65 years.  Of these, nearly 6 million are older than 
85, and over 70,000 have reached their 100th birthday.  By 2030, the number of individuals age 65 or 
older is likely to reach 70. 3 million, and this group will comprise 20 percent of the entire U.S. population.  
The number of the “oldest old” , people age 85 or older , is expected to grow to at least 20.9 million by 
2050.  
 254 Older Americans use more health care than any other age group, a nd researchers predict that increased 
longevity is likely to require more financing from federal health care systems, including Medicare and 
Medicaid.  As life expectancy increases, the health care system will need to find new ways to address 
disease and di sability during later life.  
Scope of NIH Activities: Research and Programmatic  
OAICs are designed to develop or strengthen each awardee institution’s programs in a key area of aging 
research, contribute to greater independence for older persons, and offer opportunities for training and 
career development in aging research for young scientists.  The program’s ultimate goal is to enhance 
translation of basic and developmental research on aging to applications and interventions that increase 
or maintain indepen dence for older persons.   
NIH expects each OAIC, in its selected area of focus, to:  
 Provide intellectual leadership and innovation in geriatrics;  
 Stimulate translation of basic and clinical research in aging;  
 Facilitate and develop novel multidisciplinar y and interdisciplinary research strategies to address 
current issues in geriatrics care;  
 Stimulate incorporation of emerging technologies, methods, and scientific advances into research 
designs;  
 Serve as a source of advice and collaboration to other ins titutions regarding technology, 
methodology, analysis, or other expertise relevant to research in aging; and  
 Provide research training and career development for future leaders in geriatrics research.  
NIH Funding for FY 2010 and FY 2011  
NIH funding for the  OAICs was $13.97 million in FY 2010 and $13.34 million in FY 2011  for non -ARRA 
(regular appropriations) , and $0.21 million for ARRA appropriations . 
FY 2010 and FY 2011 Progress Report  
Programmatic and Research Activities and Outcomes  
 The University of Florida OAIC  focuses its aging research on sarcopenia ( degenerative age-related 
muscle loss), including biological mechanisms and contributing factors, as well as the prevention and 
rehabilitation of disability resulting from sarcopenia. University of Flor ida researchers examine these 
issues from interdisciplinary perspectives across the entire spectrum of biomedical investigation, 
including molecular biology, animal studies, clinical research, behavioral and social sciences, and 
epidemiology.  
 255  The Boston M edical Center at Boston University  has established an OAIC in collaboration with Tufts 
University and the Joslin Clinic. This Center fosters collaborations among the universities’ 
multidisciplinary teams of investigators to improve physical mobility by cov ering the entire spectrum 
of drug discovery, from target identification to clinical trials and function -promoting therapies.  
 The University of Pittsburgh OAIC  provides support and resources for investigators to identify 
interventions to optimize mobility and balance and prevent fall -related injuries in the elderly. This 
OAIC provides an integrated, multidisciplinary approach by pooling resources from five schools at 
the University of Pittsburgh. The Center is currently conducting several studies of exercis e and other 
interventions to improve balance and mobility in individuals with chronic low back pain and/or 
arthritis.  
 The theme of the Duke University OAIC  is to understand and modify different causes of decline in 
physical functioning. The Duke OAIC devel ops and evaluates interventions designed to help older 
Americans prepare for, cope with, and recover from disability arising from late -life disease and 
aging.  
 The Johns Hopkins University OAIC  supports research to determine the causes of and potential 
interventions to reduce frailty in older adults. To support frailty intervention studies, the university 
created a clinical translation unit and a registry of older adults who might be willing to participate in 
research. Recently, Center investigators reported that the drug losartan, commonly used to treat 
high blood pressure, may be an effective treatment for loss of muscle mass and strength in older 
adults.  
 The University of California, Los Ange les OAIC  supports the development and testing of interventions 
to prevent disability. The center emphasizes research that bridges basic biomedical and clinical 
science. Current projects are addressing the underlying causes of bone loss in osteoporosis and the 
effects of stroke on nerve -repair genes in the aged brain.  
 The University of Maryland, Baltimore OAIC  is studying rehabilitation approaches involving exercise 
and motor learning. The goal is to improve the recovery of older adults who have suffered a stroke, 
hip fracture, or other chronic debilitating disease. The Center plans to translate these findings i nto 
effective community -based rehabilitation programs.  
 Research at the University of Texas Medical Branch --Galveston OAIC  focuses on age -related 
sarcopenia and its contribution to loss of independence in older persons.  
 The Wake Forest University OAIC’s  mission is to assess the risk factors of physical disability in older 
adults and to develop and test effective preventive interventions. Several current studies are 
exploring the effects of diet and exercise on diverse health parameters.  
 The Yale University  OAIC’s  research theme is the investigation of geriatric health conditions that 
have several causes. This focus includes single conditions resulting from several contributing factors 
or affecting several outcomes, and multiple conditions occurring at the s ame time.  
 256  The University of Michigan OAIC , the first OAIC funded by NIH, advances research on health care 
problems of older adults. Recent findings from the Michigan OAIC suggest that the proportion of 
certain inflammatory cells in visceral fat increases with age, which may explain why age -related 
weight gain has been associated with chronic inflammatory disease.  
 The Mount Sinai School of Medicine OAIC  focuses on pain management and palliative care. Ongoing 
studies are exploring the relationships among pos toperative pain, pain treatment, delirium, and 
cognitive impairment in older adults as well as the effect of inpatient palliative care consultation 
teams on hospital costs, hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay, and readmission rates.  
 The OAIC a t the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences  is collaborating with the University of 
Oklahoma Health Sciences Center as the most recently established Center. This Center studies the 
causes of declining skeletal and heart muscle function with aging and  is developing new 
interventions for these conditions by targeting protein metabolism and other approaches.  
Recommendations for Improving the Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Outcomes of the OAICs  
The OAIC Coordinating Center at Wake Forest University facil itates information exchange and research 
collaborations among OAICs.  The Coordinating Center helps develop and implement projects in shared 
areas of interest.  Its major activities include developing and maintaining Web -based resources to 
facilitate collabo ration among OAIC sites and interface with the public; coordinating and enhancing OAIC 
training programs; and organizing seminars and other activities for senior investigators and trainees at 
the OAIC Annual Scientific Meeting.  
Evaluation Plans  
NIH program  staff review the progress of each OAIC every year as part of the non -competing renewal 
process.  In addition, each OAIC is required on a yearly basis to convene an external advisory board of 
expert scientists outside the OAIC institution(s) to evaluate the  Center’s progress and suggest any 
necessary changes in its scientific or administrative directions to achieve its stated goals.  
Future Directions  
NIH plans to continue to fund new and existing Claude D. Pepper OAICs  and to continue to develop and 
strength en the progress in key areas of aging research in order to discover new and effective ways to 
promote healthy and productive aging .

 258 Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Centers   
Establishment of the Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Centers  
The Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance, Research, and Education Amendments of 2001 (the 
MD-CARE Act, Pub, L. No. 107 -84) included provisions for expanding and intensifying research on 
muscular dystrophy and mandated that NIH establish Centers of Excellence for muscular dystrophy 
rese arch.  Congress designated the centers as the Senator Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy 
Cooperative Research Centers (Wellstone MDCRCs) in the Omnibus Appropriations for FY 2004 (Public 
Law 108 -199) in honor of the former Minnesota senator who was a driv ing force behind the MD -CARE 
Act. The MD -CARE Act of 2008 officially renamed the centers.  
How the Wellstone MDCRCs Function within the NIH Framework  
NIAMS, NINDS, and NICHD fund the Wellstone MDCRCs through the U54 Specialized Centers 
Cooperative Agreement  award mechanism (see Table 4 -3). NHLBI also has co -sponsored the two most 
recent competitions for Wellstone MDCRCs, co -funds one Center, and plans to support projects within 
future Wellstone MDCRCs, if NIH receives fundable applications that address NHLBI ’s mission.  
A Steering Committee, consisting of directors and co -directors of each center and NIH science officers, 
coordinates the Wellstone MDCRCs’ scientific program.  Through annual meetings, the Steering 
Committee promotes collaborations among center i nvestigators, sharing of resources and exchange of 
scientific information.   
Description of Disease or Condition  
The muscular dystrophies are a group of more than 30 genetic diseases characterized by progressive 
degeneration of skeletal muscles.  Many dystro phies also affect other organ systems such as the heart, 
brain, blood vessels, and gastrointestinal tract (stomach and intestines).  Some forms occur in infancy or 
childhood, whereas others usually do not appear until middle age or later.  The Wellstone MDCR Cs 
address, but are not limited to, the following conditions.  
 Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most 
common childhood form of muscular dystrophy  and is  an X-linked recessive disease . Because it is 
carried on  the X chromosome and its effects are masked by the normal gene , it primarily affects 
males. Boys who have DMD lack the protein dystrophin, which muscle cells need to function 
properly. DMD usually becomes evident when a child begins walking. Patients typi cally require a 
wheelchair by age 10 to 12 and die in their late teens or 20s. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), a 
less severe disease, occurs when the body produces low levels of dystrophin or forms of dystrophin 
that does not work properly.  
 Myotonic dyst rophy.  Myotonic dystrophy is commonly an adult form of muscular dystrophy, 
although forms of this disease can affect newborns and other children. It is marked by myotonia (an 
inability to relax muscles after they contract) and muscle wasting and weakness. Myotonic 
 259 dystrophy varies in severity and symptoms. It can affect body systems in addition to skeletal 
muscles, including the heart, endocrine organs (organs that release hormones, or substances that 
affect cell function in another part of the body, into t he bloodstream), eyes, and gastrointestinal 
tract.  
 Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD).  FSHD initially affects muscles of the face (facio), 
shoulders (scapulo), and upper arms (humeral). Symptoms usually develop in the teenage years. 
Some affected individuals become severely disabled. Wasting of muscles of the trunk can lead to 
life-threateni ng breathing complications.  
 Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMD).  The CMDs are a group of muscular dystrophies with 
different genetic causes. Muscle weakness is present at birth. Several forms are caused by defects in 
the interactions of muscle cells wit h the surrounding protein matrix. The brain and other organs are 
often affected in addition to muscles.  
 Limb -girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs).  All LGMDs show a similar distribution of muscle 
weakness, affecting both upper arms and legs. Scientists have identified many forms of LGMDs; 
some affect children, whereas others affect adults.  
 Miyoshi myopathy.  Miyoshi myopathy causes initial weakness in the calf muscles. It is caused by 
defects in the same gene that is responsible for one form of LGMD, suggesti ng that research 
progress against one form of muscular dystrophy could lead to a better understanding of other 
forms as well.  
Currently, no treatment can stop or reverse the progression of any form of muscular dystrophy.  
Treatments such as physical therap y, use of appliances for support, corrective orthopedic surgery, and 
drugs can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life for some individuals.  Some drugs, such as 
corticosteroids, can slow the progression of DMD to some extent, but have adverse effects.  Several 
treatments, including gene therapy, cell -based treatments, and strategies to reduce muscle wasting 
have shown promise in experiments using cells and animals.  Clinical trials of some therapies have begun, 
including the use of drugs to reduce muscle damage, approaches to increase muscle mass by stopping 
the activity of other proteins that inhibit muscle growth, and strategies to bypass mutations that cause 
disease.  
Burden of Illness  
DMD and BMD affect 1 in 3,500 to 1 in 5,000 boys, respectively.  With more than 4 million annual births 
in the U.S., about 400 to 600 boys are born with DMD or BMD every year.415 Myotonic dystrophy affects 
approximately 1 in 8,000 people worldwide,416 whereas FSHD affects approximately 1 in 20,000 people 
and affects men and wome n equally.417

417 For more information, see www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000707.htm . 
 260 The MD -CARE Act called for the CDC to collect and analyze information on the number, incidence, 
correlates, and symptoms of individuals with muscular dystrophy.  Results from the project described the 
delay between the start of symptoms and def initive diagnosis of DMD.  
Scope of NIH Activities: Research and Programmatic  
As nationally recognized Centers of Excellence in muscular dystrophy, the Wellstone MDCRCs promote 
communication and collaboration, develop and share research resources, and help train new muscular 
dystrophy researchers.  Each center can conduct a mixture of basic research to understand the diseases, 
translational research to turn basic research findings into interventions for patients, and clinical studies 
to test interventions in people.  The overall focus of the Wellstone MDCRCs is to integrate activities to 
develop therapies for muscular dystrophies.  An open competition led to one new Wellstone MDCRC in 
2010, and the renewal of two that had received funds from the FY 2005 competit ion.  
Collectively, the Wellstone MDCRCs conduct research on various forms of muscular dystrophy, including 
some not listed above.  Examples of research topics addressed by the Wellstone MDCRCs in FY 2010 and 
FY 2011 follow.  
 At the University of Rochester  center, researchers are examining cellular and molecular factors that 
contribute to myotonic dystrophy and testing potential treatments.  
 The Washington, D.C., Children’s National Medical Center,  for which funding ended in FY 2010,  
focused on genetic and cellular factors that contribute to DMD’s progression and patient responses 
to treatment.  
 Research at the University of Iowa  center focuses on understanding the causes and developing 
treatments for a group of dystrophies called dystroglycanopathies, which  are associated with 
defects in the muscle proteins dystroglycans. The center also provides services through a Muscle 
Biopsy/Cell Culture/Diagnostics core.  
 The Center funded through the  University of Pennsylvania  supports a collaborative group of 
investigators involving the University of Chicago, the University of Florida and the University of 
California, Los Angeles. The projects of this center focus on the process by which muscle is lost in 
many of the muscular dystrophies and is replaced with fat and scar -like tissue, and the involvement 
of inflammation in this process. These studies could lead to novel strategies for the treatment of 
many different forms of dystrophy.   
 Ongoing research at the Boston Biomedical Research Institute  center seeks to identify specific 
biomarkers for FSHD. The Wellstone MDCRC is establishing muscle tissue and cell repository 
biomarker databases as resources for research and evaluation of clinical trials outcomes.  
 Ongoing research at t he University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  center is developing and testing 
gene therapies for DMD and other muscle disorders. Studies are aimed at designing improved gene 
therapy vectors with reduced immune response and testing methods for delivering therapeutic 
genes to muscle through veins in the legs and arms.  
 261  Established in FY 2010, the Wellstone MDCRC at Nationwide Children's Hospital  in Columbus, Ohio, 
is developing methods to overcome immune barriers to gene correction for DMD.  
Each Wellstone MD CRC has core facilities that p rovide unique resources or services  for the muscular 
dystrophy research community.  Cores include repositories of research data and biologic resources from 
patients with different types of muscular dystrophy, and assistance wit h gene therapy development and 
production.  The Wellstone MDCRC program also supports facilities and personnel for testing candidate 
therapies in mice and dogs.  
NIH Funding for FY 2010 and FY 2011  
NIH funding for the Wellstone MDCRC program was $9.1 0 millio n in FY 2010 and $9.0 0 million in FY 
2011.  
FY 2010 and FY 2011 Progress Report  
Programmatic Activities and Outcomes  
Programmatic accomplishments in FY 2010 and FY 2011 include establishing a new Wellstone MDCRC at 
the Nationwide Children's Hospital,  Columbus, Ohio, in FY 2010. In addition, the Wellstone MDCRCs at 
the University of Iowa  and University of Pennsylvania  competed successfully for renewal through FY 
2015. The Children’s National Medical Center  Wellstone MDCRC, funded under an earlier Wells tone 
competition, ended its formal center program in FY 2010. However, many of the center’s investigators 
continue to conduct muscular dystrophy research with support from other grants, including a Center for 
Research Translation award from NIAMS. Moreover , Children’s National Medical Center still is eligible to 
compete for a future Wellstone MDCRC grant.  
The Wellstone MDCRC program has provided opportunities for public -private partnerships in muscular 
dystrophy. Projects have involved collaborations with, and additional support from, companies such as 
PTC Therapeutics and Insmed. The centers also have strong ties with patient advocacy groups and 
voluntary health organizations that promote and support muscular dystrophy research. These 
organizations are inte gral to the success of the Wellstone MDCRCs; they provide advice, assist with 
patient recruitment, and enhance the research through additional support. The synergy created by NIH 
resources and the involvement of industry and advocacy groups is accelerating  progress toward 
muscular dystrophy treatments.  
Because training and career development is an important component of the Wellstone MDCRC program, 
all current centers have formal training and education cores. These facilities provide stipends to 
predoctoral  and postdoctoral researchers and enhance the programs’ educational environments.  
Wellstone MDCRCs have leveraged other NIH funding in muscular dystrophy. In addition to awards 
reported in prior biennial reports, an NIH institutional training grant in neu romuscular disease has been 
awarded to investigators at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.  Investigators participating in the University 
of Pennsylvania  Wellstone MDCRC received an NIH program project grant for examining the 
mechanisms and potential therapeut ics for muscular dystrophy -associated muscle fibrosis.  
 262 The Wellstone MDCRC core facilities are national resources for the muscular dystrophy research 
community. These facilities have been publicized at national meetings and through center Web sites and 
the Wellstone MDCRC Web site.418 These shared research tools foster collaborations across 
departments or schools within institutions, and among investigators and health care providers 
nationwide. Examples of these facilities include:  
 The University of Rochester  established the Repository and National Registry of Myotonic Dystrophy 
Patients and Family Members when NIH renewed the center’s funding in FY 2008. The facility, a 
combination of the center’s existing Tissue Repository Core and the NIH -funded Registry of  
Myotonic Dystrophy Patients and Family Members, provides researchers with cell or tissue samples 
and clinical information about the donors of these samples.419  
 The University of Iowa  Wellstone MDCRC oversees a Muscle Tissue/Cell Culture/Diagnostics Core  
that serves as a national tissue and cell culture resource for research, as well as a laboratory for 
patient diagnostic and post -intervention biopsy evaluation for clinical trials. A repository contains 
muscle biopsies from approximately 3,000 patients with a wide variety of neuromuscular disorders. 
It also contains fibroblast cultures that have been established from more than 100 patients with 
myopathies, predominantly muscular dystrophies. Diagnostic tests include western blots that can be 
performed for a l imited number of proteins in frozen muscle tissue or in cultured fibroblasts.  
 The Physiological Assessment Core  at the University of Pennsylvania  evaluates muscle integrity and 
function for center investigators and other academic and industrial researchers . The facility’s staff 
conduct measurements that now are the standard for showing whether a new treatment is effective 
in animals.  
 The MDCRC at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  launched the National Vector Muscular 
Dystrophy Core  in FY 2008. The Core is producing and testing gene therapy materials for 
researchers.420 As tests are completed successfully, the facility will supply investigators with 
materials that they can use for clinical research. The core also will help investigator s submit 
documents to regulatory agencies (such as the U.S. FDA) and comply with all relevant regulations.  
Research Activities and Outcomes  
The Wellstone MDCRCs conduct basic, translational, and clinical studies related to a variety of muscular 
dystrophies.  Examples of accomplishments in FY 2010 and FY 2011 are provided below.  
 The University of Rochester  MDCRC has made advances in preclinical therapy development and 
clinical trial readiness that collectively improve the environment for new therap ies for myotonic 
dystrophy. In collaboration with PTC Therapeutics, they have identified chemical scaffolds with 
activity in increasing muscleblind 1 protein to address the pathophysiological mechanisms in the 
disease. Also, these investigators have shown preclinical efficacy of antisense oligonu cleotides in

 263 blocking or eliminating the toxic RNA that forms the basis for myotonic dystrophy. This MDCRC -
supported work has fostered a collaboration on antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics with Isis 
Pharmaceutic als, that is now funded by an NINDS translational cooperative agreement. In clinical 
studies, the Rochester MDCRC has developed a simpler, less invasive muscle biopsy technique to 
serve as a molecular surrogate to evaluate candidate therapeutic efficacy in  early stage human 
clinical trials. Their natural history studies of progression of myotonic dystrophy in patients have 
developed and incorporated new measures (including quality of life measures) and collected 
longitudinal data that will be essential in d esigning studies, stratifying subjects, and assessing 
outcomes in interventional clinical trials.421 
 Investigators at the University of Florida, who  are members of the Wellstone MDCRC at the 
University of Pennsylvania,  are developing new methods to assess sk eletal muscle health in patients 
with muscular dystrophies using magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI/S). After 
conducting pilot studies in DMD patients with support from the Wellstone MDCRC, these 
investigators are now collaborating with resea rchers at Oregon Health and Sciences University and 
Children’s Hospital Philadelphia in a larger study comparing MRI/S and measures of skeletal muscle 
function in 100 DMD boys and 50 healthy controls. This larger study called ImagingDMD422 is 
supported by NI AMS and NINDS. Through the Wellstone MDCRC, new methods are being explored 
to non -invasively measure muscle scaring and replacement by fat in various forms of dystrophy.  
 The University of Iowa  MDCRC has led important breakthroughs in the molecular mechani sms of the 
dystroglycanopathies, a class of muscular dystrophy where understanding has lagged until the 
focused efforts of the Iowa group.423 The Iowa MDCRC leveraged new therapeutic strategies for drug 
development that are being explored in an NIH ARRA awar d that has developed in vitro  animal 
models for drug testing and identified putative drug scaffolds through a high throughput screening 
program. The Iowa MDCRC also is addressing clinical trial readiness, to ensure that sufficient tools 
(e.g., biomarkers, trial endpoints) and knowledge (natural history) are in place to run safety and 
efficacy clinical trials in human subjects.  
 Clinical researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  Wellstone MDCRC have 
developed a new method for delivery of  fluids through veins to skeletal muscles in the legs of 
dystrophy patients that is safe and well tolerated. Previously, they showed that this is an effective 
method for delivery of therapeutic genes in a dog model of DMD. Ongoing studies are preparing for  
future clinical trials of therapeutic genes to be delivered through the veins to muscles of the arms 
and legs of dystrophy patients. Researchers at the Nationwide Children’s Hospital  Wellstone MDCRC 
are preparing to conduct a clinical trial of a gene tran sfer approach directly into the muscles of DMD 
patients, and to test methods for minimizing the immune responses.

 264 Recommendations for Improving the Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Outcomes of the Wellstone MDCRCs  
Major review criteria for the Wellstone MDCRCs include the degree to which an institution shows that it 
can foster substantive collaborations among its researchers and with scientists elsewhere that address 
key issues in muscular dystrophy and its potential to serve as a national infrastructure and training 
resource.  NIH responded to the burgeoning number of basic research findings in muscular dystrophy by 
changing the focus of the last two Wellstone MDCRC competitions (FY 2008 and FY 2010) to encourage 
research that translates basic findings abo ut the disease to human studies and applications in the clinic.  
To further capitalize on NIH basic and translational research investments and accelerate progress 
toward effective treatments or other improvements in patients' lives, the next round of center s424 will 
be expected to involve clinical research with direct interactions between researchers and muscular 
dystrophy patients. In addition to therapy development, NIH will also encourage studies of the natural 
history of diseases, biomarker identification and validation, biopsychosocial studies, and other patient -
oriented research.  Centers may also contain basic and preclinical translational projects, as long as efforts 
are directed toward therapy development and other strategies for improving the lives of patients.  NIH 
will continue to monitor the program’s coordination and productivity as staff review the progress of 
each center at the time of noncompeting renewal and through regular contact with Wellstone MDCRC 
leaders through the Steering Committee.  
Futu re Directions  
NIH is committed to supporting six outstanding Wellstone MDCRCs.  The agency issued three five -year 
awards to the Wellstone MDCRC program in FY 2010.  In FY 2013, NIH plans to hold an open competition 
and intends to fund up to three Centers (for a total  of up to six active Centers) , pending the availability 
of funds .425 Grantees will join the network of Wellstone MDCRCs to translate scientific findings and 
technological developments into treatments for muscular dystrophies.   
NIH supports multi -project gran ts and core centers for muscular dystrophy research at academic 
institutions, in addition to the Wellstone Centers.  The agency also is promoting interactions among 
investigators at the Wellstone Centers and these other institutions to expand the scope and strength of 
the Wellstone Network.

 266 National Institute on Minority Health and Health  
Disparities Centers of Excellence   
Establishment of National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Centers of Excellence  
The Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act of 2000 (Pub. L. No. 106 -525) 
included provisions for the creation of NCMHD to conduct and support research, training, and 
dissemination of information with respect to minority health conditions and other populations with 
health disparities.  The statute specifically mandated establishing COEs  in research institutions for the 
purpose of conducting biomedical and behavioral health disparities research and t raining.  In FY 2010, 
the NCMHD was re -designated the NIMHD, and all the responsibilities of the NCMHD authorized under 
Public Law 106 -525 were transferred to the Institute in accordance with the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111 -148). 
NIH defines health disparities as differences in the incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and 
burden of diseases and other adverse health conditions that exist among specific population groups.  
These population groups are African Americans, Ame rican Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, 
Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, subpopulations of all of these racial/ethnic 
groups, socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, and medically underserved populations residing in  
rural areas.  
The COE program supported by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities 
(NIMHD), formerly the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD) is one of 
several programs that are central to NIH’s scientific investment strate gy for addressing and ultimately 
eliminating health disparities.  That strategy encompasses:  
 Conducting and supporting basic, clinical, social sciences, health services, and behavioral research;  
 Promoting enhancement of research infrastructure and research training; and  
 Community engagement and disseminating research information to racial and ethnic minority and 
other communities that experience health disparities.  
How the NIMHD Centers of Excell ence Function within the NIH Framework  
NIMHD established COEs to create a comprehensive platform in academic institutions to address health 
disparities in priority diseases and conditions through the fundamental strategies of research, training a 
diverse s cientific workforce, and engaging the community.  The COE program supports the Department 
of Health and Human Services Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities and the 
National Prevention Strategy.  
Since 2002, NIMHD has established COEs i n 35 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands  (see Table 4 -4). Initially, the program used three different funding mechanisms for 
 267 Resource -Related Centers (R -24), Exploratory Centers (P20), and Comprehensive Centers (P60).  The use 
of these different funding mechanisms allowed NIMHD to support institutions with varying levels in 
biomedical research expertise and capacity.  This approach also enabled NIMHD to leverage resources to 
support the capabilities of the nation’s geogr aphically and culturally diverse institutions that have 
longstanding partnerships with local and regional health disparity organizations and communities.  The 
Resource -Related Centers mechanism, which NIMHD no longer uses, enabled institutions with emerging  
or modest research infrastructures to begin building research capacity to address health disparities.  
Several institutions that received these R24 awards have since successfully established an NIMHD COE 
using the Exploratory Centers mechanism.  
NIMHD supp orted 51 COEs in FY 2010 and FY 2011 and all COEs funded since 2005 have had project 
periods of five years.  The types of institutions funded directly by the NIMHD COE program or throu gh 
partnerships with NIMHD COEs  include research -intensive institutions, medical schools, historically black 
colleges and universities, Hispanic -serving institutions, tribal colleges/universities, and liberal arts 
colleges.  NIMHD COEs have also been successful in developing novel partnerships with different types of 
non-academi c institutions, such as community -based organizations or foundations.  These partnerships 
provide a means for non -academic institutions to engage in the research on improving minority health 
and or eliminating health disparities.   
Description of Disease or Condition  
The research and other COE activities that NIMHD supports are not limited to or focused on a single 
disease, illness, or condition.  As described in various solicitations published in the NIH Guide for Grants 
and Contracts , the NIMHD COEs conduct research on health disparities associated with the following 
priority diseases and conditions: cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, infant 
mortality, mental health, and obesity.  The NIMHD COE program also supports research on lung di sease, 
liver disease, psoriasis, scleroderma, and glomerular (kidney) injury; all of these diseases and conditions 
disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities.  
Burden of Illness  
The diversity of the contemporary American population is one of th e nation’s greatest assets.  However, 
the richness of this diversity is diminished by the disproportionate burden of disease and illness and the 
reduced access to quality health care that racial and ethnic minority populations and the rural and urban 
poor e xperience.  Compelling evidence of the disparate health status of America’s racial and ethnic 
minority and economically disadvantaged populations includes their shorter life expectancies and higher 
rates of cancer, birth defects, developmental disorders, infant mortality, asthma, diabetes, obesity, 
cardiovascular disease, and stroke.  Racial and ethnic minorities and the medically underserved also 
suffer a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality associated with HIV/AIDS , autoimmune 
diseases  (such  as lupus and scleroderma ), oral health , sexually transmitted diseases , mental disorders , 
violence , and substance abuse.   
 
 268 Scope of NIH Activities: Research and Programmatic  
Guided by the NIH Health Disparities Strategic Plan and Budget, the scope of activ ities conducted by 
NIMHD COEs includes research, research capacity (including training and education), and community 
outreach.  This broad scope provides considerable flexibility for COEs to design and implement multi - 
and transdisciplinary strategies, stud ies, interventions, and activities needed for reducing and ultimately 
eliminating health disparities.  
The NIMHD COE program requires all COEs to establish mandatory cores:  
 An Administrative Core for carrying out and overseeing administrative matters and functions;  
 A Research Core for conducting, coordinating, generating, and advancing research on health 
disparities;  
 A Research Training and Education Core for conducting and advancing research training; and  
 A Community Engagement Core for engaging communi ties and others as partners in eliminating 
health disparities through community participation in research and the joint development and 
dissemination of effective health information messages and research findings.  
NIH Funding for FY 2010 and FY 2011  
NIH fu nding for the NIMHD COE program was $67.9 million in FY 2010 and $68.8 million in FY 2011.  In FY 
2011, in partnership with the EPA, funding of $5 million enabled 10 NIMHD COEs to establish research 
programs for addressing environmental factors contributing  to health disparities.   
FY 2010 and FY 2011 Progress Report  
Programmatic Activities and Outcomes  
Significant programmatic accomplishments included establishing four new COEs and one competing 
renewal.  The number of active NIMHD COEs was 51 in FY 2010 and FY 2011 (see Table 4.4).  
 In FY 2010, administrative supplements to support bioethics were made available through the NIH 
Office of the Director.  Four NIMHD COEs received funding to establish novel rese arch and or 
research training activities addressing bioethics issues.  
 In FY 2011, in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the scope of 10 NIMHD 
COEs was expanded.  The principle objective of the collaborative research effort put forth  by EPA and 
NIMHD is to generate innovative approaches to alleviate environmentally driven health disparities 
and improve access to healthy environments for vulnerable populations.  
Research Activities and Outcomes  
Funding for the NIMHD COEs has resulted i n several FY 2010 and FY 2011 research accomplishments.  
The COEs conduct research on minority health and the biologic and non -biologic factors contributing to 
 269 health disparities.  As shown by the following examples, NIMHD researchers are exploring the role of 
social and cultural factors in the prevalence of priority diseases and conditions.  
The NIMHD Center of Excellence in Eliminating Disparities (CEED) at the University of Illinois, Chicago 
addresses racial/ethnic disparities through research in cancer pr evention, early detection and treatment 
management.  Research conducted by this COE has found that multi -level hierarchical models based on 
an existing population -based ovarian cancer survival cohort in which disadvantage measures were 
computed with the 200 0 census data, suggest that women living in disadvantaged neighborhoods were 
more likely to be diagnosed at later stages of ovarian cancer and have shorter survival.  
The NIMHD COE program at the University of Montana has established diverse partnerships w ith seven 
or more of the tribes in Montana and is engaged in community based participatory research (CBPR) 
projects.  CBPR is a research approach that is preferred by many tribes.  One such project has been 
established to address Apsáalooke (CROW) community cancer risks from contaminated water.  This 
partnership includes Little Big Horn College, the CROW tribe, the Indian Health Service, the Apsáalooke 
Water and Wastewater Authority, the 107 Committee (of Tribal Elders), Montana State University and 
the Univer sity of New England.  This partnership has conducted over 120 well surveys.  
Collaborations between NIMHD COEs and Clinical Translation Science Awards (CTSA) and Clinical 
Translation Science Institutes (CTSI)  have been an important part of the success of th e COE program.  
Seventeen (81  percent ) of the 21 active NIMHD P60 COE institutions  have also received CTSA program 
funding and several of these institutions are leveraging their joint interests and capabilities in 
community engagement and outreach and healt h disparities by establishing partnerships.  For example, 
the NIMHD COE established at the New York University (NYU) Center for the Study of Asian American 
Health has partnered with the CTSI established by NYU and New York City Health and Hospitals 
Corporat ion (HHC).  The NIMHD COE and the NYU CTSI have developed the Community -Empowered 
Research Training (CERT) Program for building research capacity among community organizations and 
providers interested in conducting community -initiated research.   
Recommendat ions for Improving the Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Outcomes of the NIMHD COEs  
Since their inception in year 2002, NIMHD COEs made progress toward the elimination of health 
disparities.  However, much more needs to be done in designing and taking the critical steps needed to 
translate research findings to meaningful actions that will improve the quality of life experienced by 
those overburdened by health disparities.  Efforts need to be more targeted toward interventions that 
work.  As a result of the 20 08 NIH Summit to Eliminate Health Disparities and subsequent Funding 
Opportunity Announcements recognizing and stressing the multifactorial and multidisciplinary nature 
and complexities of health disparities, NIMHD COEs established in 2010 have placed emph asis on 
research and interventions addressing the social determinants of health.  NIMHD and its COEs cannot 
and are not acting alone ; NIMHD has sought and continues to seek new partners and also encourages 
each NIMHD COE to establish partnerships with other  NIH-funded centers and programs, other federal 
agencies, and others committed to eliminating health disparities.  The partn erships established with 
other f ederal agencies in FY 2010 and FY 2011 expanded the scope of research and research activities 
 270 conduct ed by NIMHD COEs.  In FY 2012, NIMHD will continue to pursue the recommendations previously 
published in the 2008 -2009 Biennial Report:   
 Establish partnerships with other NIH -fund ed centers and programs, other f ederal agencies, and 
others committed to elimi nating health disparities as a way to maximize resources.  
 Increase the diversity of the scientific workforce, especially the number of women and biomedical 
and behavioral scientists from racial/ethnic and other health disparity populations.  Focused effort s 
are especially needed to increase the number of women scientists and researchers who 1) remain in 
the sciences beyond the terminal research or professional degree and beyond the postdoctoral or 
residency stage and who pursue basic or clinical research as  a career and 2) serve in leadership and 
decision -making roles as members of scientific review panels or members of national advisory 
councils.  
 Create opportunities for biomedical and behavioral scientists to work with social scientists, health 
services r esearchers, and other public health researchers to address more effectively the 
transdisciplinary challenges in health disparities elimination and prevention research.  
 Enhance the n ation’s research capacity to conduct health disparities research by expand ing the 
research and training opportunities available.  
Evaluation Plans  
NIMHD program staff evaluate the COEs’ annual progress by examining each COE’s published peer -
reviewed articles, books, and book chapters; conferences sponsored and presentations give n on health 
disparities; community engagement activities, such as health fairs and other forums for disseminating 
health -promotion materials; community participation in research and clinical trials (if applicable); 
training of junior faculty from health di sparity populations, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate and 
undergraduate students; and K –12 educational efforts.  This review ascertains the COE’s progress in 
meeting the aims and objectives of the grant and assists in identifying areas of concern that nee d to be 
addressed.  The Office of Minority Health, HHS , will assist the NIMHD in evaluating the effectiveness of 
the NIMHD COE s funded to promote patient –centered  outcome  research.  
Future Directions  
The NIMHD COE program will continue to intensify research  efforts to understand, reduce , and 
eliminate health disparities, with an emphasis on sustaining current partnerships and establishing new 
ones.  The 2012 Summit on the Science of Eliminating Health Disparities involve d agencies across the 
federal governmen t and result ed in several new partnerships for the NIMHD and for the NIMHD COEs 
and several significant recommendations for future research themes.  With the establishment of new 
partnerships, NIMHD expects that its COEs will continue to discover new biomedical and behavioral 
knowledge for improving minority health and eliminating health disparities within and across the 
priority areas of cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, infant mortality, mental 
health, and obesity, as well a s in lung and liver diseases, psoriasis, scleroderma, and glomerular injury.  It 
 271 is also expected that NIMHD COEs will embrace future research themes that will expand beyond these 
areas to include research recognizing and integrating the environmental scien ces, bioethics, social and 
political sciences, and policy with translational practices and interventions to build a healthier society.  
The COEs also will continue to develop new technologies for measuring the diverse interactions 
between health disparitie s and social and policy level factors and new paradigms.  The resulting new 
knowledge and technologies will lead to the development of bio -psychosocial and other interventions 
and strategies for improving minority health and eliminating health disparities.  
The success of these and future research efforts by the NIMHD COEs will continue to depend, in part, on 
the development of improved methodological tools, measures, validated instruments, and novel 
research designs for disentangling the contribution to hea lth disparities of biologic, behavioral, and 
social factors, and health policies and practices.  Conducting population -based studies for reducing the 
incidence and prevalence of health disparities among individuals living in different geographical regions 
of the United States  (especially the Mississippi Delta, Appalachia, the U.S. -Mexico border region, and 
tribal communities ) will continue to be important.  NIMHD will continue to support studies to eliminate 
or decrease the impact of factors, including natura l disasters, that contribute to the excess risks, 
morbidity, and mortality associated with living in these regions.

 274 Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network   
Establishment of the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network  
The Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) was  established in 2003 by the Office of Rare 
Diseases Research (ORDR) in collaboration with six NIH ICs.  The RDCRN has developed a novel 
collaborative model of rare disease research in a number of ways including integration of patient 
advocacy groups as rese arch partners.  Its purpose is to facilitate clinical research in rare diseases 
through support for 1) collaborative clinical research in rare diseases, including longitudinal studies of 
individuals with rare diseases, clinical studies and trials; 2) traini ng of clinical investigators in rare 
diseases research; 3) pilot and demonstration projects; 4) a test bed for distributed clinical data 
management that incorporates novel approaches and technologies for data management, data mining, 
and data sharing acros s rare diseases, data types, and platforms; and 5) access to information related to 
rare diseases for basic and clinical researchers, academic and practicing physicians, patients, and the lay 
public.   
In February 2008, ORDR, in collaboration with several N IH ICs, opened a re -competition for funding 
support for  the network and the Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC).  The resulting 
network consists of 19 consortia and a Data Management Coordinating Center, each with cooperative 
agreement awards for  five years.  ORDR is collaborating with NINDS, NIAID, NIAMS, NICHD, NIDCR, 
NHLBI, NIDDK, and NCI.   
The DMCC houses all data for the network centrally via in -house scalable and customizable electronic 
data capture systems.  Some of the data systems built by the DMCC for the RDCRN include a specimen 
collection, shipment, and tracking system; randomization system; participant management system with 
electronic case report forms; standardized and automated report sets (accrual, demographics, adverse 
events, compl iance, study status); automated XML/CSV data sets with associated data dictionaries; and 
an Adverse Event Data Management System for real time reporting, submission, and review of adverse 
events.   
An additional feature, the RDCRN Contact Registry, together  with consortia information, is designed for 
access by the general public [ http://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org ]. Users access an enrollment form 
for the Contact Registry via one of 19 consortium -specific we b pages.  The RDCRN consortia web pages 
and associated links to the Contact Registry are accessible from disease -specific searches on a variety of 
internet browsers.  171 diseases are represented by 9,806 registrants.  The Contact Registry has been 
utilized a s a pathway for informing registrants about studies.  The first instance of this success was a 
partnership between the DMCC and the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC) whereby over 
500 subjects were recruited and the study was completed within th ree months.  
The DMCC also maintains the public web pages and portals for all consortia within the network.  Since 
August 2009, the public web pages have experienced over 600,000 visits with 515,000 visits occurring in 
the last 12 months.  
 275 Clinical trials a nd research studies and network collaborations have resulted in 279 publications 
including one book, nine book chapters, three conference posters, 45 conference papers, two special 
publications, and 219 journal articles.  
How the RDCRN Functions within the NIH Framework  
Each consortium develops and, after approval, carries out clinical protocols for a set of related rare 
diseases with guidance from one or several of the participating institutions.  A steering committee guides 
the network.  The steering committ ee consists of the principal investigator of each consortium and the 
DMCC, the RDCRN program coordinator from ORDR, NIH program scientists from the participating ICs, 
and the Chair of the Coalition of Patient Advocacy Groups (CPAG) in the network.  
The netw ork’s improved infrastructure and functions build on lessons learned in previous years and uses 
those approaches that have proven to be most effective while searching for additional efficiencies and 
innovation.  
Description of Disease or Condition  
A disease  is defined as rare if fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States have it.  There are more 
than 6,500 rare diseases for which fewer than 250 treatments have been approved as orphan products , 
drugs that are specifically developed to treat a rare disease . Approximately 80 percent of rare diseases 
are thought to be of genetic origin.  It is estimated that at least 50 percent of the patients are children.  
The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) estimates that about 1 in 10 people in the U.S. 
have  a rare disease, which translates to as many as 25 to 30 million people.  The 19 consortia below

Burden of Illness  
The burden of illness for all rare diseases is difficult to assess because of the large number of disorders, 
the complexity of each disease, and the very  limited availability of prevalence and incidence data.  
Overall, all the rare diseases listed above and the others studied are devastating and costly, not only for 
the patients but also for the family.  This is due partly because of the disease severity and  partly because 
diagnosis can take a long time, often occurring well after symptoms have appeared.  In addition, often 
treatment is not available once a disease is diagnosed.  Moreover, it is impossible to assess the pain, 
suffering, and lost opportunities e xperienced by patients and their families.  Because of these variables, 
these rare diseases specifically and others generally represent a disproportionate share of health care 
spending.  In addition, few drug companies conduct research into rare diseases sin ce it is difficult for 
them to recover the costs of developing treatments for small, geographically dispersed populations.  
Scope of NIH Activities: Research and Programmatic  
The RDCRN brings together experts who are skilled in studying, diagnosing, and tre ating particular 
groups of rare diseases and who train junior faculty and postgraduate fellows.  In addition, the network 
enables each consortium to gather groups of patients with similar or related disorders, fosters basic 
scientific investigation and long itudinal natural history and epidemiological studies which in the past 
have often not been funded, encourages synergy in translational research, and enhances opportunities 
for collaborative clinical investigation.  
NIH Funding for FY 2010 and FY 2011  
NIH f unding for the RDCRN was $20.8 0 million for 19 consortia and the DMCC  in FY 2010 and  $16.6 0 
million  in FY 2011 . The total cost over five years for the RDCRN’s Phase II is estimated to be $117 million.   
FY 2010 and FY 2011 Progress Report  
Programmatic and Research Activities and Outcomes  
The RDCRN is unique in its approach to addressing rare diseases.  Previously, the NIH ICs funded research 
on individual rare diseases in their respective disease -type or organ domain.  In the first two years since 
the second grant cycle of the RDCRN (August 2009 to September 2011), the network has activated 41 
multi -site clinical research studies.  The Network has 78 active studies which are accruing at over 162 
clinical centers; 26 of the enrolling clinical centers are located  internationally (with representation from 
 279 the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Canada, Iceland, and 
Australia).  In addition, 100 trainees were prepared to lead future rare diseases research.  Since August 
2009, 10 st udies have completed accrual and are in the final analysis phase.  In addition, a total of 8,329 
participants have been enrolled since the beginning of the second grant cycle.  The network established 
a comprehensive training program for clinical investigato rs and developed a network -wide web site to 
inform the public, physicians, patients, and investigators about the rare diseases under study.  The 
network’s aims continue to include training a cadre of young investigators in the clinical and 
physiological pro cesses associated with each disease and pharmacologic aspects of specific rare 
diseases.  The network’s training includes instruction on and experience with methodologies for patient -
oriented clinical research in rare diseases, including biostatistics and e pidemiology, and the 
conceptualization, ethics, design, implementation, analysis, and reporting of controlled clinical trials.  An 
integrated training program provides supervision by clinicians and biostatisticians with extensive 
experience in investigating  rare diseases and developing novel therapies.  The training program also 
provides an integrated statistics, epidemiology, and computer science curriculum; seminars on clinical 
trial design; courses in the basic sciences underlying experimental therapeutics  and in ethics; and career 
development support.  
Findings in recent publications are  examples of  just a few of the scientific -research accomplishments of 
the RDCRN:  
 Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus in Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM):  LAM is a progressive lun g 
disease, primarily in young women.  Sirolimus stabilized lung function and was associated with a 
reduction in symptoms and improvement of life for select patients with LAM.  
 Mexilitine is an effective therapy in improving symptoms and signs of myotonia in patients with 
non-dystrophic myotonia.  
 N-carbamylglutamate may serve as an important therapeutic adjunct in the treatment of acute 
hyperammonemia in patients with propionic acidemia.  The drug may serve as an important 
therapeutic adjunct in the treatment o f acute hyperammonemia in this disorder.  
 Children with neonatal urea cycle defects (UCDs) typically have high mortality and poor 
neurologic outcomes unless they receive liver transplantations.  A study of children with 
neonatal urea cycle defects concluded that early  liver transplantation, aggressive metabolic 
management, and early  childhood intervention improve the neurologic outcome for children 
with UCDs.  
Recommendations for Improving the Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Outcomes of the RDCRN  
Future Directi ons  
ORDR and its partner NIH Institutes will develop requirements for the next five -year grant cycle.  The 
requirements will build on the experience and lessons learned in the program’s previous years.

 281 Autism Centers of Excellence   
Establishment of the Autism Centers of Excellence  
CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network estimates that about 1 in 88 
children has an ASD. These estimates are based on data collected from health and special education 
records of children living in 14 areas of the U.S. during 2008. .426 NIH is working to better understand the 
causes of autism spectrum disorder  and develop treatments for this serious and disabling disorder.  
To address this public health challenge, Congress passed the Combating Autism Act of 2006, which 
emphasized the need to expand research and improve coordination among NIH Centers of Excellence 
focused on autism spectrum disorder . In response to the Combating Autism Act, the NIH Autism 
Coordinating Committee formed the Autism Centers of Excellence (ACE) program b y consolidating the 
aims of two previous autism spectrum disorder  research programs into a single research effort.  The 
previous programs were the Collaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism (CPEA, established in 1997) 
and Studies to Advance Autism Resea rch and Treatment (STAART, established in 2002 and completed in 
2008).  The ACE program, funding of which began in FY 2007 and FY 2008, focuses on identifying the 
causes of autism spectrum disorder  and developing new and improved treatments.  
How the Autism Centers of Excellence Function within the NIH Framework  
A key feature of the Combating Autism Act was expanding the scope of the Interagency Autism 
Coordinating Committee (IACC), initially established by the Children’s Health Act of 2000.  The IACC 
includes  federal agency representatives and members of the public appointed by the Secretary of HHS.  
In accordance with the 2006 law, and as re -authorized under the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act 
of 2011, the IACC develops and updates annually a strategic pl an for autism spectrum disorder  research 
and a summary of autism spectrum disorder  research advances.  The first edition of the plan was 
released in 2009, and annual updates were released in 2010 and 2011.  Though the ACE program was 
initiated prior to compl etion of the first IACC Strategic Plan, ACE activities address many identified 
priority areas, including biomarkers, genetic susceptibility, pharmacological treatments, early 
intervention, and risk and protective factors.  
The ACE program comprises five cen ters and six research networks.  ACE centers  foster multidisciplinary 
collaboration among teams of specialists at a single facility to address a particular research question in 
depth.  Each center conducts interdependent sub -projects.  ACE networks  unite rese archers at many 
different facilities throughout the country; working as a unit, each network addresses a particular 
research question in depth.  Because networks encompass multiple sites, they are able to recruit large 
numbers of participants with autism sp ectrum disorder , achieving optimal design for treatment trials.

 282 The goals of the ACE program were established by the NIH ACC —a working group composed of the 
seven NIH Institutes (NIMH, NICHD, NIDCD, NINDS, NIEHS, NINR, & NCCAM) that support autism 
spectru m disorder  research and are tasked with enhancing the quality, pace, and coordination of 
research efforts at the NIH in order to find a cure for autism.  Five of the ACC ICs provide funding to the 
ACE program (NIMH, NICHD, NIEHS, NINDS, & NIDCD), and these ICs share administrative and oversight 
responsibilities.  
Description of Disease or Condition  
Leo Kanner first described autism in 1943 as a disorder “characterized by extreme aloneness and a 
desire for the preservation of sameness, with a variety of behavioral (cognitive, affective) symptoms 
derived from them.”427 Over time, growing recognition of a broader range of related disorders led to the 
use of the term autism spectrum disorder , which includes several complex neurodevelopmental 
disorders of early  childhood that vary in severity, share common clinical features, and usually persist 
throughout the lifetime of the individual.  Common features include social impairments; verbal and 
nonverbal communication difficulties; and restricted, repetitive, and st ereotyped behavior patterns.  
“Classic” autistic disorder is the most disabling; other forms of autism spectrum disorder , such as 
Aspergers disorder, have fewer or milder symptoms.  Intellectual disabilities, seizures, and self -abusive 
behaviors are common a mong children at the more severe end of the spectrum.  
A child’s primary caregivers often are the first to identify autism spectrum disorder  symptoms.  As early 
as infancy, a baby with autism spectrum disorder  may be unresponsive to people or focus intently  on 
one item to the exclusion of others for long periods.  A child with autism spectrum disorder  may appear 
to develop normally and then withdraw and become indifferent to social engagement.  Clinicians can 
make a reliable autism spectrum disorder  diagnosis for most children by age three.  The current autism 
spectrum disorder  diagnostic criteria and classifications represent progress in identifying a core set of 
developmental symptoms that, in the past, clinicians might have diagnosed differently because the 
criteria were more narrowly defined than they are today.  
Burden of Illness  
Autism spectrum disorder  causes tremendous economic and social burdens for families and society at 
large.  Although autism spectrum disorder  varies greatly in character and severity, it occurs in all ethnic 
and socioeconomic groups and affects every age group.  Currently, no coherent and comprehensive 
system of care is available for affected individuals.  People with autism spectrum disorder  might receive 
private and public services in special education settings, hospitals, university medical centers, or 
residential treatment facilities, among others.  
Some scientists and economists have estimated that the combined direct and indirect costs of pr oviding 
care for all Americans with autism spectrum disorder  during their lifetimes exceed $34 billion.  The 
estimated costs over a lifetime for each person total $3 million.428 Families often incur large debts for

 283 medical and education services that public p rograms or medical insurance do not cover . In addition, 
autism  spectrum disorder  often leads to profound emotional hardships for patients and their families. 
However, t he Affordable Care Act  will help ease the financial burden that often comes with treatin g and 
caring for people with autism  spectrum disorder . The law requires new plans to cover autism screening 
and developmental assessments for children at no cost to parents and allows parents to keep their 
children on their family health insurance until th ey turn 26. Insurers will also no longer be allowed to 
deny children coverage for a pre -existing condition such as autism or to set arbitrary lifetime or annual 
limits on benefits.  
Prevalence estimates —the number of affected individuals at a given point in  time —have increased 
markedly since the early 1990s.  CDC currently estimates that as many as 1 in 88 children ha s autism 
spectrum disorder .429 Boys are approximately four times as likely as girls are to have autism spectrum 
disorder .430 However, it is unclear if incidence, the number of new cases across time in the same 
population, also has increased.  It also is unclear whether the rise in prevalence is due to such factors as 
the use of different criteria to diagnose autism spectrum disorder , earlier and more a ccurate autism 
spectrum disorder  diagnoses , or increases in biologic, environmental, or other risk factors . A similar 
increase in autism spectrum disorder  prevalence has occurred in other countries.  
Scope of NIH Activities: Research and Programmatic  
The si x centers and five networks that compose the ACE program cover a broad range of autism 
spectrum disorder  research areas, including early brain development and functioning, social interactions 
in infants, rare genetic variants and mutations, associations be tween autism -related genes and physical 
traits, possible environmental risk factors and biomarkers, and a potential new treatment.  
In an effort to support and accelerate research in the prevention, cause, diagnosis, and treatment of 
research on autism spe ctrum disorder , NIH created the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR), 
an informatics system and central data repository.  NDAR collects a wide range of data types, including 
phenotypic, clinical, and genomic, as well as de -identified medical images,  derived from individuals who 
participate in autism spectrum disorder  research, regardless of the source of funding.  NDAR provides 
the infrastructure to store, search across, retrieve, and analyze these varied types of data.  
While NDAR receives data from many public and privately funded research sources, all ACE centers and 
networks are required to contribute their data to NDAR.  NDAR also coordinates data access with other 
federal databases, such as the NIMH Center for Collaborative Genetic Studies.  The ce nter is a national 
resource for researchers who study the genetics of complex mental disorders, including autism 
spectrum disorder , and stores human DNA, cell cultures, and clinical data.  In 2011, NDAR received an 
HHS innovates  award, recognizing its outsta nding efforts to accelerate research within the Department.

 284 NIH Funding for FY 2010 and FY 2011  
Five NIH ICs fund the ACE program: NICHD, NIDCD, NIEHS, NIMH, and NINDS.  NIH funding for the ACE 
program, which includes centers (P50s), a cooperative agreeme nt (U01), and networks (R01s), was 
$25.6 0 million in FY 2010 and $25.5 0 million in FY 2011.   
FY 2010 and FY 2011 Progress Report  
Programmatic and Research Activities and Outcomes  
The activities and several accomplishments of the ACE program are highlighted briefly below.  
Yale University:  Researchers are searching for biomarkers of visual engagement and auditory perception 
in infants at risk for autism spectrum disorder . Their projects will build upon existing research on the 
behavioral, brain, and molecular aspects of autism spectrum disorder  and may lead to new 
discoveries on the causes and best treatments for autism spectrum disorder . 
University of Illinois at Chicago : Researchers are studying genetic factors as well as brain chemicals and 
brain functions that could account for repetitive behaviors in people with autism spectrum disorder . 
They also are testing whether genetic differences influence how individuals respo nd to certain 
medications intended to reduce the frequency of these behaviors.  
University of Washington:  Researchers are investigating genetic and other factors that might increase a 
person’s risk for autism spectrum disorder  and factors that might protect people from developing 
autism spectrum disorder . Researchers at the University of Washington center conducted a 
randomized computerized training program for adults with autism spectrum disorder  who showed 
initial impairment in their ability to recognize faces. Their findings suggest that adults with autism 
spectrum disorder  who undergo the computerized training can gain expertise in facial recognition 
and processing skills.431 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill:  Invest igators from the ACE network are studying abnormal 
processes in early brain development by examining brain images of very young children at risk for 
developing autism spectrum disorder. A study from the network found evidence of enlarged 
portions of the am ygdala in 6 - to 7-year -old children with autism spectrum disorder  and that these 
differences were associated with deficits in social and communicative behavior.432 
University of California, San Diego  (UCSD) : The UCSD ACE is using brain imaging methods to tra ck brain 
development in children believed to be at risk for autism spectrum disorder . In a recent study, UCSD 
ACE investigators found that children with autism had 67 percent more neurons in the prefrontal 
cortex and heavier brains for their age compared t o typically developing children. Since these

432 Kim JE, et al. Arch Gen Psychiatry . 2010;67 (11):1187 –97. PMID: 21041620.  
 285 neurons are produced before birth, the study’s findings suggest that differences in prenatal cell birth 
or maintenance may be involved in the development of autism.433 
University of California, Los Angeles: Resear chers at the ACE are studying the causes and treatments of 
social communication problems in people with autism spectrum disorder .  
University of Pittsburgh:  The University of Pittsburgh  ACE is studying how people with autism spectrum 
disorder  learn and und erstand information.  
Drexel University:  Researchers with the Drexel University  network sites are studying possible risk factors 
and biological indicators of autism spectrum disorder  before and soon after birth. This project is part 
of the Early Autism Ris k Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI).  
University of California, Davis:  Researchers with the UC -Davis network sites are examining factors that 
might be useful for improving treatment outcomes in very young children with autism. They are 
comparing an intens ive behavioral intervention to standard community -based treatment.  
Wayne State University:  Investigators with the Wayne State network sites will conduct a clinical trial to 
test the safety and efficacy of buspirone, a drug that increases the body’s produc tion of serotonin —
one of several neurotransmitters that brain cells use to communicate with each other —as an early 
intervention in children younger than six years with autism spectrum disorder . A pilot study by the 
Wayne State researchers showed that buspi rone improves social interaction and reduces repetitive 
behaviors, sensory dysfunction (extreme sensitivity or lack of sensitivity to light, noise, and touch), 
and anxiety in children with autism.  
University of California, Los Angeles:  Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles  network 
sites are studying the relationship between genes related to autism and physical features. They also 
are investigating rare genetic variations, mutations, and abnormalities that affect a person’s risk for 
autis m.  
Several investigators across the ACE centers and networks (University of California – Los Angeles, 
University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Pittsburgh, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
Yale University, and University of Washington),  contributed both genetic data and analytic expertise 
to study the genome -wide characteristics of rare copy number variations or genetic mutations that 
are strongly associated with the risk of autism spectrum disorder . This large study identified both 
inherited and de novo  (i.e., spontaneous or induced, not inherited) copy number variations that 
implicated a number of genes associated with risk of the disorder.434

 286 Recommendations for Improving the Effectiveness, Effici ency, and Outcomes of the NIMHD COEs  
Evaluation Plans  
The Combating Autism Act of 2006 and the NIH Reform Act of 2006 require that NIH conduct periodic 
reviews of the ACE program.  To implement this requirement, the NIH formed the Autism Evaluation 
Implementation Oversight (AEIO) working group, with membership comprising Planning and Evaluation 
Officers at the five NIH Institutes that provide financial support and scientific expertise to the ACE 
program (NIMH, NICHD, NINDS, NIEHS, and NIDCD).  In 2008 -2009, the group initiated a feasibility study 
to evaluate the ACE program.  The objectives of the study were 1) to determine the availability of data 
and the feasibility of answering key questions about the ACE program, and 2) to obtain baseline data on 
the ACE program.  The key study questions focused on the program’s implementation and scientific 
scope.  This included describing the organization and staffing of the ACE centers and networks, the 
publication and grant history of the ACE investigators, areas o f research addressed in the ACE program, 
leveraging of additional funding sources, and the role of NDAR in the ACE program.  The study also 
collected data on initial outputs resulting from ACE program research, including research publications 
and science ad vances, as well as other information to guide plans for future ACE program evaluation 
activities.  Overall, this initial study and future evaluation activities are intended to complement, but not 
duplicate, the NIH scientific peer review process, which rema ins the primary means to ensure the 
scientific excellence of NIH -funded research.   
A report addressing the areas outlined above was developed in 2010.  Based on the results of the 
feasibility study, the AEIO has outlined plans to periodically update the bas eline data, including plans to 
update several elements in 2012.   
Future Directions  
In 2011, as in the prior year, the NIH ACC convened a two -day meeting at which the investigators 
presented progress towards the goals of their ACE and exchanged ideas for co llaborations.  Some 
sessions addressed data sharing options through the NDAR, with time allotted for a question -and-
answer period with NDAR staff. ACE principal investigators and project principal investigators, as well as 
core directors and data managers, attended.  Principal investigators were encouraged to invite K award 
(career development grant) recipients, fellows, and postdoctoral students from their laboratories.  
In FY 2011, NIH re -issued the ACE funding announcements (RFA -HD-12-195; RFA -HD-12-196).  Applicants 
were instructed that highest funding priority would be given to projects related to gaps identified by the 
2011 IACC Strategic Plan.
