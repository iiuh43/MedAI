designed to ensure that the assets of the charter school are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and to
ensure that adequate accountin g data are completed to allow for the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The internal control structure is
designed to provide reasonable assurance, recognizing thal (1) the costs ofa control should not exceed
the benefits likely to be derived; and (2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and
judgments by management.
As a recipient of federal and state financial assistance, the School is also responsible for ensuring that an
adequate internal control structure is in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations
related to those programs. This internal control structure is also subject to periodic evaluations by the
School's management.
As part of the School's Singte Audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control
structure, including that portion related to federal and state financial assistance programs, as well as to
detennine that the School has complied with applicable laws and regulations.
BUDGETARY CONTROLS
In addition to internal accounting controls, the School maintains budgetary controls. The objective of
these budgetary controls is to ensure compliance with legal provisions embodied in the annual
appropriated budget approved by the Board of Trustees. Annual appropriated budgets are adopted for
the general fund. The final budget for the fiscal year is reflected in the financial section.
ACCOUNTING SYSTBM AND REPORTS
The School's accounting records reflect generally accepted accounting principles, as promulgated by
GASB. The accounting system of the School is organized based on funds. The funds are explained in
Notes to the Financial Statements, Note 2.

The intent of the Board is to ensure that the School manages its budget and finances in a fiscally prudent
and responsible way by establishing financial policies for the budget, fund balance, and maintenance of
adequate reseryes. The government-wide and proprietary financial statements are repofted using the
economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded
when earned and expenses are recorded when the liability is incurred. Govetnmental fund financial
statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual
basis of accounting. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the current
period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period'

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinions
We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities and
each major fund of Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School, as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30,2022,
and the ielated notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise Pennsylvania Cyber Charter
School's basic financial statements as listed in the financial section of the table of contents.
ln our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the governmental activities, the business-type activities and each major fund of Pennsylvania
byber Charter School, as of June 30,2022, and the respective changes in financial position and, where
applicable, cash flows thereof for the fiscal year then ended in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinions
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Governntent Auditing
Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those
standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
section of our report. We are required to be independent of Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School and to
meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our
audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinions.
Respons ihil iti es of Manoge ment for th e Financial Stule ments
Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of theie financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America; and for the design, imptementation, and nraintenance of internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether

Responsihilities of Manugemenl for the Financial Statements (continued)
In preparing the financial statements, nlanagement is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or
events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about Pennsylvania Cyber Charter
School's ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the financial statement date,
including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter.
Aatlitor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Finuncial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's reporl that
includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level ofassurance but is not absolute assurance and
tlrerefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing
Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists, The risk of not detecting a niaterial
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the
aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial
statements.
ln performing an audit in accordance with GAAS and Government Audiling Slandards,we
r Exercise professionaljudgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
r Identifu and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such
procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.
. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circuntstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's intemal control.
Accodingly, no such opinion is expressed.
o Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by marlagement, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the
financiaI statenrents.
o Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,
that raise substantial doubt about Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's ability to continue as a
going concem for a reasonable period of time.
We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related
matters that we identified during the audit.

Emphasis of Matter
Implementation of GASB Statement No. 87, Leases
Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School implemented the provisions of GASB Statement No. 87, Leases, in
the current fiscal year. Our opinion is not modified rvith respect to this nratter.
Re q u i re d S upp le me ntary I nfo rmatio n
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's
discussion and analysis, budgetary comparison information, other post-employment benefits information,
and the pension information on pages 15 through 25 and 6l through 6T be presertted to supplement the
basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and, although not a par1
of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who
considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an
appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied ceftain limited procedures to
the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the
information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our
inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic
financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because
the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidenoe to express an opinion or provide any
assurance.
S upp I e me ntury I nformati o n
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of fbrming opinions on the financial statements that collectively
comprise Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's basic financial statentents. The accompattying Schedule
of Expenditures of Federal Awards, as required by Title 2 U.S. Code o.f Federal Regulations Part 200,
Unrform Adninislralive Requit'enxenls, Cosl Principles, and Audit Requirentents .for Federal Awards, is
presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial statements.
The Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards is the responsibility of management and was derived
from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic
financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit
of the basic financial statements and ceftain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling
such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic
financial statements or the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion,
the Schedule of Expenditures of FederalAwards is fairly stated, in all materialrespects, in relation to the
basic financial statements as a whole.

REPORTING THE SCHOOL AS A WHOLE
Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities
While this document contains the funds used by the School to provide programs and activities, the view
of the School as a whole looks at all financial transactions and asks the question, "How did we do
financially during Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022?" The Statement of Net Position and the Statement
of Activities answer this question. These statements include all assets and liabilities using the accrual
basis of accounting similar to the accorinting used by most private-sector companies. This basis of
accounting takes into account all of the current year's revenues and expenses regardless of when cash is
received or paid.
These two statements report the School's net position and changes in net position. This change in net
position is important because it tells the reader, for the School as a whole, whether the financial position
of the School has improved or diminished. The causes of this change may be the result of many factors,
some financial, some not. Non-financial factors include the current charter school laws in Pennsylvania
concerning funding, availability of facilities, required educational programs, mandated services and other
factors.
OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Government-Wide Statements
The government-wide statements report information about the School as a whole using accounting
methods similar to those used by private-sector companies. The Statement of Net Position includes all
the School's assets and liabilities. All the current year's revenues and expenses are accounted for in the
Statement of Activities regardless of when cash is received or paid.
The two government-wide statements report the School's net position and how it has changed. Net
position, the difference between the School's assets and deferred outflows of resources and liabilities and
deferred inflows of resources, is one way to measure the School's financial health or position.
Over time, increases or decreases in the School's net position is an indication of whether its financial
health is improving or deteriorating, respectively.
To assess the overall health ofthe School, you need to consider additional non-financial factors, such as
changes in the School's enrollment (growth) and the academic achievement of the students.
In the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities, the School shows the following kinds of
activities:
Governmental activities - Most of the School's basic services are included here, such as
instruction, support services, operation and maintenance of plant, and administrative services.
Tuition, state and federal subsidies and grants finance most of these activities.a

REPORTING THE CHARTER SCHOOL'S MOST SIGNIFICANT FUNDS
Fund Financial Statements
Fund financial statements provide detailed information about the most significant funds - not the School
as a whole. Some funds are required by state law.
Governmentalfund -Most of the School's activities are reported in the general fund, which focuses on
the determination of financial position and change in financial position, not on income determination.
They are reported using an accounting method called modified accrual accounting, which measures cash
and all other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash. The general fund statements provide a
detailed short-term view of the School's operations and the services it provides. General fund
information helps the reader determine whether there are more or fewer financial resources that can be
spent in the near future to finance the School's programs. The relationship (or differences) between
governmental activities (reported in the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities) and
governmental fund is reflected in reconciliations on pages 29 and 31.
Proprietary fund - The School maintains one proprietary fund. The internal service fund is an accounting
device used to accumulate and allocate costs internally among the School's various functions. The
School uses the internal service fund to account for its self-funded health insurance. Because these
services benefit governmental rather than business-type functions, they have been included within
governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE SCHOOL AS A WHOLE (continued)
The majority of the decrease in total liabilities relates to the School's proportionate share of the PSERS
net pension liability. The deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources are a result of
recording the net pension liability and net OPEB liability in accordance with GASB 68 and 75,
respectively. For more information on this, see the notes to the financial statements.
The results of this year's operations as a whole are reported in the Statement of Activities on page 27 . All
operating expenses are reported in the first column. Specific charges, grants, revenues, and subsidies that
directly relate to specific expense categories are presented to determine the final amount of the School's
activities that are supported by other general revenues. The largest general revenue is tuition charged to
local educational agencies for enrolled students residing in those educational agencies.
Total revenue increased $6,376,290 (3.36%) while total expenses only increased by $3,974,364 (2.58%)
leading to a positive increase in net position. The increase in revenue was due to an increase in the
average reimbursement rate per student of $735 (4.67%). The School has consistently had an increase in
net position since the year ended June 30, 2018 due primarily to increased enrollment and increasing
reimbursement rates.
Table A-2 takes the information from the Statement of Activities, reaffanges it slightly, so you can see
total revenues for the year. Prior year information is also provided for a comparative analysis of

have remained consistent. Revenues increased $6,406,640 (3.37%) while expenditures increased
$11,584,144 (7.54%). The increase in revenues was due to an increase in both tuition revenue and federal
funds received. The average reimbursement rate was $16,480 per student compared to $15,745 in the
prior year. Although expenditures increased more than revenues the School had a Net Change in Fund
Balance of $38,512,031 as compared to 542,216,024 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The School
has consistently had a positive change in fund balance since the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.

Budgeting Highlights
The School's budget is prepared according to Pennsylvania law and is based on accounting for certain
transactions on a basis of cash receipts, disbursements, and encumbrances. The only budgeted fund is the
General Fund.
For the General Operating Fund, budgeted revenue and other financing sources were in the amount of
$204,581,546. Actual revenues and other financing sources were less than this budget amount by
$6,811,386. The expenditures were budgeted at $175,688,034. Actual expenditures were less than
budgeted expenditures by approximately $L6,429,905. A schedule showing the School's original and
final budget amounts compared to actual amounts is provided on page 6l '
The COVID-l9 Pandemic continued to impact the school's operations during the 202112022 school year
with respect to enrollment, federal program revenues, and expenditures. Duringthe202112022 frscalyear,
PA Cyber experienced an increase in fund balance of the General Fund and net position. Nevertheless,
the school experienced a decrease in both total revenues and total expenditures.
The school budgeted for receipt of monies associated with COVID-l9 Pandemic relief through the
Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act which included the Elementary and
Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER II Funds). At the time the budget was developed and
finalized, there was uncertainty regarding ESSER II Funds because guidelines for the funds were not fully
developed. Nevertheless, according to the Pennsylvania school code, school districts must pass a final
budget by June 30 each year. Several months later after the budget was developed and approved, the
school did not apply for ESSER II Funds. This led to the reduction in federal program revenues.
Also, in terms of revenues, the school experienced a slight decrease in enrollment for the first three
months of the 2OZll2022 school year compared to the budgeted forecast. Yet, after this time frame,
revenues from school districts were on target so the effect of the slight decrease in enrollment was only a
l.4o/o decrease in local revenues for the 202112022 school year.
In terms of expenditures, there were several main areas which explain why actual expenses were less than
budgeted expenses. These areas are salaries/benefits, facilities construction, and professional services.
With respect to salaries/benefits, PA Cyber budgeted for additional positions that were anticipated to be
filled during the 202112022 school year. To be succinct, many hires were delayed while other open
positions were not filled during the 202112022 school year. These open positions will be filled during the
202212023 school year.
PA Cyber also budgeted monies for multi-million-dollar renovation projects for four of its facilities
located in Midland, PA. The projects were scheduled to begin during the 2021-2022 school year.
However, the start date of the projects were delayed. The school during the 2022 year began negotiations
to acquire additional properly and will be constructing a facility to meet its needs. The school intends to
follow through with the four renovation projects to its existing facilities. However, these projects will be
delayed until the new facility is completed.
Another construction/renovation project was scheduled for a newly leased regional office in Hanisburg
was delayed. The reason for this delay is that it unexpectedly took much longer to secure a new location
for this location and as a result the retrofit of the new location to meet the school's requirements was
delayed.

THE SCHOOL'S FUNDS (continued)
Budgeting Ilighlights (continued)
Finally, expenditures associated with student testing unexpectedly declined. The reason is that the testing
session was postponed from the 2021-2022 school year to the 2022-2023 school year.
During the 202112022 school year, monies were budgeted for professional services. As a result of the
pandemic, the services were not utilized for such activities associated with constructior/renovation
projects, marketing initiatives and upgrades to technology infrastructure.
Therefore, both internal and external factors led to the positive variance associated with expenditures.
CAPITAL ASSETS AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION
Capital Assets
At June 30,2022, the School's Governmental Activities had $40,800,597 invested in a broad range of
capital assets, including land, buildings and improvements, fumiture and equipment, right-to-use assets
and construction in progress. This amount represents a net increase of $1,665,910 from last year. The
increase in capital assets is primarily due to the addition of right-to-use assets recorded due to the
implementation of GASB No. 87. More detailed information regarding the School's capital assets is
included in the Notes to the Financial Statements Q''lote 6).
Leases
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022,the School implemented GASB Statement No. 87, Leases and
on July I,2021, recognized a lease liability of $4,983,585 and righfto-use assets totaling $4,983,585. As
of June 30,2022, right-to-use assets totaling $6,415,752 and the total lease obligation was $5,602,887.
The current portion of the lease obligation is $802,179.
Debt Administration
As of June 30,2022, the School had no outstanding debt.
ECONOMIC FACTORS AND BUDGETS
Though the cyber charter school concept is now widely-accepted as a viable and indeed necessary
educational model, the issue concerning how cyber charter schools are funded will likely remain
contentious in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the demand for the type and quality of services
provided by the School continues to grow. The success of the School has created hundreds of new jobs in
ind around the community of Midland, PA as more professional and support staff are needed to serve the
growing roster of students. As a state-wide school, the School is also establishing a physical presence in
k"y u."u. across Pennsylvania. Furthermore, the innovations - technological and educational - pioneered
by the School, are helping to establish Pennsylvania as a leader in the development of 21't century
learning strategies for public education.

Fiscal Year Ended Jane30,2022
NET CHANGE IN FUND BALANCE - GOVERNMENTAL FUND
Amounts reported for governmental uctivities in the statement of activities
are different because:$ 38,512,031
Capital outlays are reported in the governmental fund as expenditures.
However, in the statement of activities, the cost of those assets is allocated
over their estimated useful lives as depreciation expense.
Add: capital outlaYs
Less: depreciation and amortization expense
The govemmental fund reports proceeds from the sale of property and
equipment as revenue. However, in the statement of activities, only the
gain or loss (proceeds less depreciated cost) is recognized from the sale of
capital assets. This is the amount by which the net book value exceeded
sales proceeds.
The issuance of notes payable provides current financial resources to the
governmental fund, while repayment of the principal consumes the current
financial fesources of the governmental fund. Neither transaction,
however, has any effect on the change in net position. This amount is the
net effect of these differences in the treatment of notes payable and related
items:

NOTE 1 - REPO ENTITY
The Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School (the School) was formed under the laws of the state of
Pennsylvania to provide elementary and secondary education to students through a computer
managed learning system designed to meet individual students' needs and styles.
A reporting entity is comprised of the primary govefirment, component units, and other organizations
that are included to ensure that the financial statements of the School are not misleading. The
primary government consists of all funds, departments, boards, and agencies that are not legally
separate from the School. For the School, this includes general operations.
Component units are legally separate organizations for which the School is financially accountable.
The School is financially accountable for an organization if the School appoints a voting majority of
the organization's governing board and (l) the School is able to significantly influence the programs
or services performed or provided by the organization; or (2) the School is legally entitled to or can
otherwise access the organization's resources; the School is legally obligated or has otherwise
assumed the responsibility to finance the deficits of, or provide financial support to, the organization;
or the School is obligated for the debt of the organization. Component units may also include
organizations that are fiscally dependent on the School in that the School approves the budget or the
issuance of debt. The School does not have any component units.
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements of the School have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States of America. The Govemmental Accounting
Standards Board (GASB) is responsible for establishing GAAP for state and local governments
through its pronouncements (Statements and Interpretations). The more significant accounting
policies established by GAAP and used by the School are described below.
A. Basis of Presentation
The School's basic financial statements consist of government-wide statements, including a
statement of net position and a statement of activities, and fund financial statements which provide a
more detailed level of financial information.
Government-wide financial statements - The statement of net position and the statement of
activities display information about the School. These statements include the financial activities of
the overall government.
The statement of net position presents the financial condition of the govemmental and business-type
activities of the School at year-end. The statement of activities presents a comparison between direct
expenses and program revenues for each program or function of the School's governmental and
business-type activities. Direct expenses are those that arc specifically associated with a service,
program or department and therefore clearly identifiable to a particular function.
Program revenues include charges paid by the recipient of the goods or services offered by the
program, grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital
requirements of a particular program and interest earned on grants that is required to be used to
support a particular program.
-35-
THE PENNSYLVANIA CYBER CHARTER SCHOOL
Notes to the Financial Statements
Fiscal Year Ended Jane30,2022
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
A, Basis of Presentafibn (continued)
Revenues which are not classified as program revenues are presented as general revenues of the
School, with certain limited exceptions. The comparison of direct expenses with program revenues
identifies the extent to which each business activity or governmental function is self-financing or
draws from the general revenues of the School.
The effect of interfund activity has been eliminated from the government-wide financial statements.
tr'und financial statements - During the year, the School segregates transactions related to certain
School functions or activities in separate funds in order to aid financial management and to
demonstrate legal compliance. Fund financial statements are designed to present financial
information of the School at this more detailed level. The focus of governmental and enterprise fund
financial statements is on major funds. Each major fund is presented in a separate column. Non-
major funds, if any, are aggregated and presented in a single column. The fiduciary funds, if any, are
reported by type.
Proprietary fund financial statements - The focus of proprietary fund rneasurement is upon
determination of operating income, changes in net position, financial position, and cash flows. The
generally accepted accounting principles applicable are those similar to businesses in the private-
sector. The School reports the internal service fund as a proprietary fund. An intemal service fund
accounts for operations that provide services to other departments of the School on a cost
reimbursement basis. The Health Insurance Fund accounts for the employees' self-insured medical,
dental and vision benefits. Because the principal users of the internal services are the School's
governmental activities, the financial statements of the internal service fund are consolidated into the
governmental column when presented in the government-wide financial statements.
B. Measurement Focus/Bnsis of Accounting
The government-wide and proprietary fund financial statements are reported using the economic
resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when
earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash
flows. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements
imposed by the provider have been met.
The School uses funds to maintain its financial records during the year. A fund is defined as a fiscal
and accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts. There are three categories of funds:
governmental, proprietary and fiduciary.
Govemmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources
measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon
as they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are
collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period.
Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting.
However, debt service expenditures, as well as expendifures related to compensated absences, early
retirement, post-employment healthcare benefits and pensions, are recorded only when payment is
due.

B. Measurement Focus/Basis of Accounting (continued)
The School reports the following major governmental fund:
General Fund - The General Fund is the operating fund of the School and is used to account for all
financial fesources except those required to be accounted for in another fund.
Additionally, the School reports the following proprietary fund type:
Internal Service Fund - accounts for risk management and health insurance costs provided to
departments of the School.
C. Budgetary Process
The School passed an appropriated budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022 with revenues
totaling $204,58 1,5 46 and expenditures totaling $ I 75,6 8 8,034.
The School is required by state law to adopt an annual budget for the General Fund. The budget is
presented on the modified accrual basis of accounting, which is consistent with generally accepted
accounting principles.
The following procedures are followed in establishing the budgetary data reflected in the financial
statements:
1. The School prepares a budget for the next succeeding fiscal year. The operating budget includes
proposed expenditures and the means of financing them'
2. the School adopts a proposed budget, after ten days' public notice of the meeting has been
given.
3. Prior to July 1, the budget is legally enacted via resolution of the School.
4. The Budget for the general fund must be filed with the Office of Public Instruction within fifteen
(15) days after the adoption ofthe budget.
Final Budgetz The final budget for each year must be adopted (via Board vote) by June 30 of the
preceding school fiscal year.
Once the budget is approved, it can be amended at the Function and Fund level only by approval of a
majority of the members of the Board.
D. Cash and Cash Equivalents
The School's cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term
investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition, not included
in investments.

E.Investments and Fair Value Measurement
Investments are recorded at fair value, net asset value or amortized cost in accordance with GASB.
Investments consist of certificates of deposit, bonds, U.S. Treasury notes, or other short-term
investments. The School complies with the investment guidelines set forth by the Pennsylvania
School Code.
The School categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by
GAAP. The hierarchy is based on the valuation inputs used to measure the fair value of the asset.
Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; Level2 inputs are significant
other observable inputs; Level 3 inputs are significant unobservable inputs.
The School has the following recurring fair value measurements as of June 30,2022:
r Direct obligations of the U.S. Government, Govemment Sponsored Enterprise Securities,
U.S. Treasury Securities, and Municipal Bonds are valued using quoted market prices (Level
l inputs).
. Certificates of deposit are valued based on the cost of the investment plus interest receivable
at the stated interest rate (Level 2 inputs).
Below is a summary of investments measured at fair value as of June 30,2022:
U.S. Treasury Securittes

Money market funds totaling $115,627,734 at June 30, 2022 inc\tded in cash and cash equivalents,
are valued at net asset value per share as provided by GASB Statement No.72. There are no
restrictions on withdrawals and no deposit requirements.
F. Interfund Balances
On fund financial statements, receivables and payables resulting from short-term interfund loans are
classified as "interfund receivables/payables." These amounts are offset against each other in the
governmental activities column of the statement of net position, except for amounts due tolfrom
other funds which are not presented in the statement of net position. There were no interfund
transfers during the fiscal year ending Jlune 30,2022.
G. Capital Assets
General capital assets result from expenditures in the governmental funds. These assets are reported
in the governmental activities' column of the government-wide statement of net position but are not
reported in the fund financial statements.

G. Capital Assels (continued)
All capital assets are capitalized at cost (or estimated historical cost) and updated for additions and
retirements during the year. Donated capital assets, donated works of art and similar items, and
capital assets received in service concession arrangements are reported at acquisition value rather
than fair value. Improvements are capitalized; the costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do
not add to the value of the asset or materially extend an asset's life are not'
All reported capital assets except land and construction in progress are depreciated. Improvements
are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related capital assets. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method over the following useful lives:
DescriptionGovernmental Activities

Buildings and Improvements
Furniture and Equipment
Computer Equipment10 - 40 years
3 - 15 years

The School has recorded right-to-use lease assets as a result of implementing GASB 87. The right-
to-use assets are initially measured at an amount equal to the initial measurement of the related lease
liability plus any lease payments made prior to the lease term, less lease incentives, plus ancillary
charges necessary to place the lease into service. The rightto-use assets are amortized on a straight-
line basis over the life of the related lease.
H. Compensated Ahsences
The School has no compensated absences as ofJune 30,2022
I. Accrued Liabilities and Long-Term Obligations
Alt payables, accrued liabilities and long-term obligations are reported in the government-wide
financial statements.
In general, governmental fund payables and accrued liabilities that, once incurred, are paid in a
timely manner and in fulI from current financial resources are reported as obligations of the funds.
However, claims and judgments, special termination benefits and contractually required pension
contributions that will be paid from governmental funds are reported as a liability in the fund
financial statements only to the extent that they are due for payment in the currentyear.
J. Pension
For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, defened outflows of resources and deferred
inflows of resources related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net
position of the Public School Employees' Retirement System (PSERS) and additions to/deductions
from PSERS's fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by
PSERS. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are
recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms and investments are reported
at fair value.

General Information about the Pension Plan
Plan description
PSERS is a governmental cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan that provides
retirement benefits to public school employees of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (System).
The members eligible to participate in the System include all full-time public school employees,
part-time hourly public school employees who render at least 500 hours of service in the schoolyeat,
and part-time per diem public school employees who render at least 80 days of service in the school
year in any of the reporting entities in Pennsylvania. PSERS issues a publicly available financial
report that can be obtained atwww.psers.pa.gov.
Benefits provided
PSERS provides retirement, disability, and death benefits. Members are eligible for monthly
retirement benefits upon reaching (a) age 62 with at least 1 year of credited service; (b) age 60 with
30 or more years of credited service; or (c) 35 or more years of service regardless of age. Act 120 of
2010 (Act 120) preserves the benefits of existing members and introduced benefit reductions for
individuals who become new members on or after July l, 2011. Act 120 created two new
membership classes, Membership Class T-E (Class T-E) and Membership Class T-F (Class T-F). To
qualifu for normal retirement, Class T-E and Class T-F members must work until age 65 with a
minimum of 3 years of service or attain a total combination of age and service that is equal to or
greater than 92 with a minimum of 35 years of service. Benefits are generally equal to 2.0%o or
2.5yo, depending upon membership class, of the member's final average salary (as defined in the
Code) multiplied by the number of years of credited service. For members, whose membership
started prior to July 1, 2011, after completion of five years of service, a member's right to the
defined benefits is vested and early retirement benefits may be elected. For Class T-E and Class T-F
members, the right to benefits is vested after ten years of service.
Participants are eligible for disability retirement benefits after completion of five years of credited
service. Such benefits are generally equal to 2.0%o or 2.5o/o, depending upon membership class, of
the member's final average salary (as defined in the Code) multiplied by the number of years of
credited service, but not less than one-third of such salary nor greater than the benefit the member
would have had at normal retirement age. Members over noffnal retirement age may apply for
disability benefits.
Death benefits are payable upon the death of an active member who has reached age 62 with at least
one year of credited service (age 65 with at least three years of credited service for Class T-E and
Class T-F members) or who has at least five years of credited service (ten years for Class T-E and
Class T-F members). Such benefits are actuarially equivalent to the benefit that would have been
effective if the member had retired on the day before death.

from the School were $408,072 for the fiscal year ended Jlune 30,2022.
L. Fund Balance Classiftcations
GASB Code Section 1800 provides for two major types of fund balances, which are nonspendable
and spendable. Nonspendable fund balances are balances that cannot be spent because they are not
expected to be conv.tt"d to cash or they are legally or contractually required to remain intact.
Examples of this classification are prepaid items, deposits, and inventories.
In addition to the nonspendable fund balance, GASB 54 has provided a hierarchy of spendable fund
balances, based on a hierarchy of spending constraints.
Restricted - Fund balances that are constrained by external parties, constitutional provisions, or
enabling legislation.
Committed - Fund balances that contain self-imposed constraints of the government from its highest
level of decision making authority (Board of Trustees). The board of trustees may commit fund
balance for specific purposes pursuant to copstraints imposed by formal actions taken, such as a
majority vote or resoiution. These committed amounts cannot be used for any other purpose unless
the board of trustees removes or changes the specific use through the same type of formal action
taken to establish the commitment. The board's action to commit fund balance needs to occur within
the fiscal reporting period, no later than June 30ft; however, the amount can be determined
subsequent to the release of the financial statements.
Assigned - Fund balances that contain self-imposed constraints of the government to be used for a
particular purpose. The Board has delegated the Board Treasurer the authority to assign fund
balance for specific pulposes.
(Jnassigned- Fund balance of the general fund that is not constrained for any purpose.
Prioritization of Fund Balance Use
When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted (committed,
assigned, oi unassigned) amounts are available, it shall be the policy of the School to consider
restiicted amounts to have been reduced first. When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for
which amounts in any of the unrestricted fund balance classifications could be used, it shall be the
policy of the School that committed amounts would be reduced first, followed by assigned amounts
and then unassigned amounts.

M. Net Position
Net position represents the difference between assets and deferred outflows of resources and
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources. Net investment in capital assets consists of capital
assets, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, reduced by the outstanding balances of any
borrowings used for the acquisition, construction or improvement of those assets. Net position is
reported as restricted when there are limitations imposed on their use either through the enabling
legislation adopted by the School or through external restrictions imposed by creditors, grantors or
laws or regulations of other governments.
N. Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
O. Change in Accounting Principle
Effective July 1, 202l,the School adopted the new lease accounting guidance in GASB Statement
No. 87, Leases. As a result of the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance, the School
recognized on July 1,2021(a) a lease liability of $4,983,585, which represents the present value of
the remaining lease payments discounted using the School's incremental borrowing rate of 5o/o, and
(b) rightto-use assets totaling $4,983,585.
NOTE 3. CASH AND CASH EOUIVALENTS
Under Section 440.1 of the Public School Code for 1949, as amended, the School is permitted to
invest funds consistent with sound business practices in the following types of investments:
Obligations of (a) the United States of America or any of its agencies or instrumentalities
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, (b) the Commonwealth of
Perursylvania or any of its agencies or instrumentalities backed by the full faith and credit of the
Commonwealth, or (c) any political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any
of its agencies or instrumentalities backed by the full faith and credit of the political
subdivision.
Deposits in savings accounts, time deposits, or share accounts of institutions insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to the extent that such accounts are so insured
and, for any amounts above the insured maximum, provided that approved collateral, as
provided by law, is pledged by the depository.
The deposit and investment policy of the School adheres to state statutes and prudent business
practices. Deposits of the governmental funds are either maintained in demand deposits or savings
accounts, certificates of deposit, or cash equivalents. There were no deposit or investment
transactions during the year that were in violation of either the state statutes or the policy of the
School.

NOTE 9. NET PENSION LIABILITY
At June 30,2022, the School reported a liability of $140,824,584 for its proportionate share of the
net pension liability. The total pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was
determined by rolling forward the System's total pension liability as of June 30, 2020 to June 30,
2021. The School's proportion of the net pension liability was calculated utilizing the employer's
one-year reported contributions as it relates to the total one-year reported contributions. At June 30,
2022, the School's proportion was 0.3430Yo, which was an increase of 0.0248% from its
proportionate share measured as of June 30,2021'

actuarial assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement:
o The actuarial cost method is Entry Age Normal, Level Percent of Pay'
o The Investment Rate of Return is 7.00%, including inflation of 2'50o/o.
o Salary growth is an effective average of 4 .50o/o, comprised of inflation of 2.50Yo and 2.00oh fot
real wage growth and for merit or seniority increases.
o Mortality rates were based on a blend of 50% PubT-2010 and 50o/o PubG-2010 Retiree Tables
for Males and Females, adjusted to reflect PSERS' experience and projected using a modified
version of the MP-2020Improvement Scale.
r The discount rate used to measure Total Pension Liability decreased from7.25o/o as of June 30,
2020 to 7.00% as of June 30,2021.
Demographic and economic assumptions approved by the Board for use effective with the June 30,

NOTE 9 - NET PENSION LIABILITY (continued)
The long-term expected rate of refurn on pension plan investments was determined using a building
block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns,
net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class.
These iu.tg"r aie combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the
expected futo.. real rates ofreturn by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected
inflation.
The pension plan's policy in regard to the allocation of invested plan assets is established and may be

Discount rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.00o/o. The projection of cash
flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that contributions from plan members will be
made at the current contribution rate and that contributions from employers will be made at
contractually required rates, actuarially determined. Based on those assumptions, the pension plan's
fiduciary tt"t porition was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of
current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments
*us uppli"d to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.

Investments consist primarily of short-term assets designed to protect the principal of the plan assets.
The expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was determined using the OPEB asset
allocation policy and best estimates of geometric real rates of return for each asset class.
The OPEB plan's policy in regard to the allocation of invested plan assets is established and may be

Discount rate
The discount rate used to measure the total OPEB liability was 2.I8o/o. Under the plan's funding
policy, contributions are structured for short-term funding of Premium Assistance. The funding
policy sets contribution rates necessary to assure solvency of Premium Assistance through the third
fiscal year after the acttarial valuation date. The Premium Assistance account is funded to establish
reserves that are sufficient for the payment of Premium Assistance benefits for each succeeding year'
Due to the short-term funding policy, the OPEB plan's fiduciary net position was not projected to be
sufficient to meet projected future benefit payments; therefore, the plan is considered a "pay-as-you-
go" plan. A discount rate of 2.18% which represents the S&P 2}-year Municipal Bond Rate at June
30,2021,was applied to all projected benefit payments to measure the total OPEB liability.

NOTE12. CONTINGENCIES
Litigation - The School is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising from
the ordinary course of business. Management intends to vigorously defend the asserted claims.
While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management does not expect the
ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a materially adverse effect on the School's financial
position at June 30, 2022, beyond the aforementioned assignment of fund balance and recorded
liability for claims and judgements.
The School received financial assistance from federal and state agencies in the form ofgrants. The
expenditure of funds received under these programs generally requires compliance with terms and
"onditiott. specified in the grant agreements and are subject to audit by the grantor agencies. Any
disallowed Clui-. resulting from such audits could become a liability of the general fund or other
applicable funds. However, in the opinion of management, any such disallowed claims will not have
a material adverse effect on the overall financial position of the School at June 30,2022.
NOTE 13. RISK MANAGEMENT
As of July 1, 2008, the School has elected to self-fund the health and drug benefit program for its
employees. Under the program, the School employs a third-party administrator and pays all medical
claims through them. In addition, the School purchases individual and aggregate stop-loss insurance
from a commercial carrier to protect it from catastrophic claims. The School retains the risk of
liability for all claims under the aggregate stop-loss insurance. Settled claims have not exceeded the
aggregate stop-loss insurance coverage for the past 3 years.

Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters

Indenendent Auditor's Report
To the Board of Trustees
Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School
We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Governnrcnt Auditing Standards
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental
activities, the business-type activities and each major fund of Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School as of
and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes to the financial statements, which
collectively comprise Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's basic financial statements, and have issued
our report thereon dated December 14,2022.
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Pennsylvania Cyber
Charter School's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the
hnancial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Pennsylvania
Cyber Charter School's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness
of Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's internal control.
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow
management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or
detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A nnlerial wealntess is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis' A
sig;nificant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less
,.u"p than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with
governance.
Our consideration of internal control was for tlre limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this
section and was not designed to identily all deficiencies in internal control that might be material
weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identifu any
deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material
weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that have not been identified.

Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed in Accordance
with Government Auditing Standards
Indenendent Auditor's Report
(continued)
Report on Compliance and Other Mutters
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's financial
statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a
direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with
those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be
reported under Gov ernm ent Auditing Standards.
Purpose of this Report
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of ittternal control and compliance
and ihe results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal
control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with
Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and cornpliance.
Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Pennsylvania Cyber Chafter School
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program
Opinion on Each Maior Federnl Program
We have audited Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's compliance with the types of compliance
requirenrents identified as subject to audit in the OMB Contpliance Supplemenl that could have a direct
and material effect on each of Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's major federal programs for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2022. Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's major federal programs are identified in
ih" rr*rnury of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.
In our opinion, Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School complied, in all material respects, with ,the
compliance requiremenfs referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its
nrajor federal programs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022'
Basisfor Opinion on Each Maior Fecleral Program
We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAS); the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government
Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (Government Auditing
Standaids): and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part200, Unifornt
Administrative Requirements, Cosl Principles, and Audit Requirements .for Federal Av'ards (Unifornt
Guidance). Our responsibilities under those standards and the Uniform Guidance are further described in
the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.
We are required to be independent of Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School and to meet our other ethical
responsibiiities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on
comptiance for each major federal program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of
Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.

Responsibilities of Monagement for Compliance
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements refered to above and for the design,
implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirentents of
laws, statutes, regulations, rules and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to
Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's federal programs,
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Aadit of Compliance
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the
compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an
opinion on Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is
a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with CAAS, Governmenl Auditing Standards, and the Uniform Guidance will
always detect nrateriat noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance
resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the
compliance requirements refened to above is considered material, if there isa substantial likelihood that,
individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgrnent made by a reasonable user of the report
on compliance about Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's compliance witli the requirements of each
major federal program as a whole.
In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Governnrcnt Auditing Slandards, and the Uniform
Guidance, we:
. Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
r Identi8 and assess the risks of materialnoncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on
a test basis, evidence regarding Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's compliance with the
compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in tlie circumstances,
e Obtain an understanding of Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's internal control over
compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the
Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the efTectiveness of
Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School's internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no sttch
opinion is expressed.
We are required to communicate witlr those cliarged witlt governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal
control over compliance that we identified during the audit.

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over
.o*iliunr" does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned
functions, to prevent, or detect and corect, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a
federal progri* on a timely basis. A material v,eakness in internal control over compliance is a
deficieniy, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a
reasonabie possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal
program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in
'intirnal control over compliance is adeficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in intemal control over
compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material
ou.ukn"r, in internal control over compliance, yet important enougll to merit attention by those charged
with governance.
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant
deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not
identis any deficiencies in intemal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses,
as dedned- above. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over
compliance may exist that were not identified.
Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of intemal
control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
The purpose of this report on intemal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the
Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this repofi is not suitable for any other purpose'

Title IA: Fiscal
Component I: General Fiscal Requirements/Uniform Grants Guidance
Fiscal monitoring is different than program monitoring: Fiscal monitoring will include a review of a subgrantee's financial operations, which may include a
review of internal controls for program funds in accordance with state and federal requirements, an examination of principles, laws and regulations, and a
determination of whether costs are reasonable and necessary to achieve program objectives. This activity involves an assessment of financial statements,
records, and procedures. It is similar to an audit but has a lesser degree of detail and depth and, usually, a higher degree of frequency.
Fiscal monitoring includes, but is not limited to:
. Reviewing a random sample (usually 3-5 per program) of invoices or bills for expenditures charged to the program to determine if appropriate units of
measure are reported and that costs (units x rate) are correct and that costs align with grant objectives and were approved in the application for funds.. Comparing budgets or budget limits to actual costs to determine if the LEAs expenditures are likely to be more or less than budgeted. Obtaining documentation that services billed or items purchased were actually delivered according to the contract. Comparing invoices with supporting documentation to determine that costs were allowable, necessary, and allocable.
An expenditure is allowable if it is an approved use of funds under the statute or regulations governing a program and meet the intent of the program.
An expenditure is necessary if it is part of an approved application for funding.
An expenditure is allocable to the extent that the expenditure is used to meet the intent of the grant program (costs are pro-rated across grants if used to meet
several grant program obj ectives).

The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (Public Law 1Il-296) offers LEAs an alternative to collecting household applications in the National School
Lunch and National School Breakfast Programs, which eliminates unnecessary paperwork previously required by the Richard B. Russell National School
Lunch Act. The CEP is a reimbursement option for eligible LEAs and schools that wish to offer free meals to all children in high-poverty schools.

Comments
The PCCS pre-K to K, grade two to three, and grade five to six Transition Programs are excellent examples of how a school professionally and effectively
engages families in the school and its programs. Families have numerous meaningful opporlunities to engage in school life. And more importantly how to
give input to PCCS initiatives.

Executive Summary
BSE Compliance Monitoring Review
of the
Pennsylvania Cyber CS
 
PART I
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
A.Review Process
 Prior to the Bureau's monitoring the week of November 9, 2020, the Pennsylvania Cyber CS was
formally notified of the dates the onsite review would be conducted.  Notice and invitation to comment
was also provided to the Local Task Force on Right-to-Education.  The charter school was informed of
its responsibility to compile various reports, written policies, and procedures to document compliance
with requirements.
 While onsite, the monitoring team employed a variety of techniques to gain an in depth understanding of
the charter school's program operations.  This included:
 •Interviews of charter school administrative and instructional personnel
•Review of policies, notices, plans, outcome and performance data, special education forms and
formats, and data reports used and compiled by the charter school (Facilitated Self-Assessment)
•Comprehensive case studies (including classroom observations, student file reviews, and interviews
of parents and general and special education teachers).
B.General Findings
In reaching compliance determinations, the Bureau of Special Education (BSE) monitoring teams apply
criteria contained in federal and state special education regulations.  Specifically, these are:
 •Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004
•22 Pa. Code Chapter 711
•34 CFR Part 300
 This report focuses on compliance with regulatory requirements and also contains descriptive
information (such as interview and survey results) intended to provide feedback to assist in program
planning.
C.Overall Findings
 1.FACILITATED SELF ASSESSMENT (FSA)
  The team reviewed the FSA submitted by the charter school and conducted onsite verification
activities of the information submitted in the FSA.  The onsite verification activities included
review of policies, notices, procedures, and file reviews.

  Interviews were conducted with parents and teachers of students selected by the BSE for the
sample group.  The goal is to determine if the charter school involves parents and professionals
in required processes (e.g., evaluation, IEP development), whether programs and services are
being provided, and whether the charter school provides training to enhance knowledge.  Parent
and teacher satisfaction with the special education program is also generally assessed.

CORRECTIVE ACTION PROCESS
PART I of this report presented an overall summary of findings.  In the Appendix to the report, we have
provided the detailed findings for each of the criteria of the compliance monitoring document, i.e. FSA, File
Reviews, Interviews and Classroom Observations.  The detailed report of findings includes:
Executive Summary for Pennsylvania Cyber CS
•Criteria Number
•Statements of all requirements
•Whether each requirement was met, not met, not applicable or other
•Statements of corrective action required for those criteria not met.  Criteria not met that require corrective
action by the charter school are gray-shaded.
Charter schools are advised that in accordance with requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act, all noncompliance must be corrected as soon as possible but in no case later than one year
from the date of the monitoring report.  The BSE is required to verify timely correction of noncompliance,
and must report annually to the federal government and the public on this requirement.
Upon receipt of this report, the charter school should review the corrective action and improvement planning
required.  The report is formatted so that findings from all components of the monitoring are consolidated by
topical area.  The report lists the finding, and whether corrective action is required.  For certain types of
findings, corrective action will be prescribed, and will not vary from charter school to charter school.  For
example, if the finding is that the charter school lacks a specific required policy, it is reasonable to have the
BSE prescribe a standardized remedy and timeline for correcting this deficiency.  However, the majority of
corrective action activities will be individually designed by the charter school based on their own unique
circumstances and goals.  Consistent with IDEA's general supervision requirements for states, BSE must
approve all proposed corrective action.
With respect to the File Review, because students were selected at random, findings are generalized to the
entire population of students with disabilities.  During the corrective action review, the BSE Advisor will
select students at random and will review updated data, i.e. records that were developed subsequent to the
monitoring.  Consequently, the charter school should approach corrective action on a systemic basis.  As
indicated above, the charter school is also required to correct student specific noncompliance identified during
monitoring under the ICAP process.  If there has been a finding of noncompliance in the Educational Benefit
Review component, the individual students are identified to the charter school and, because of the significance
of the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to these students; the charter school must take
immediate corrective action.
The BSE Adviser will schedule an onsite visit with the charter school within 60 days following issuance of
the monitoring report.  The BSE Adviser, charter school, and PaTTAN staff will develop a Charter School
Corrective Action Verification/Compliance and Improvement Plan.  PaTTAN and IU staff are available to
assist the charter school.
Upon conclusion of the corrective action process, the charter school will be notified of its successful
completion of the monitoring process.

Special Education Services and Programs 
PA Cyber is required by the IDEIA 2004 to provide a free appropriate public education to school age children with disabilities 
who need special education and related services.  School age children with disabilities who need special education and related services are identified as eligible for special educ ation if they need specially designed instruction and have one or 
more of the following physic al or mental disabilities: 
 Autism 
 Deaf-blindness 
 Hearing Impairment including Deafness 
 Emotional Disturbance 
 Intellectual Disability 
 Multiple Disabilities  
 Orthopedic Impairment 
 Other Health Impairment 
 Specific Learning Disability 
 Speech or language Impairment 
 Traumatic Brain Injury 
 Visual Impairment including Blindness 
IDEA 2004 provides legal definitions of the disabilities that qualify a student for special education, which may differ from 
those terms used in medical or clinical practice or common usage. 
Section 504 Services 
Under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitat ion Act of 1973, some school age children with disabilities who do not meet the 
eligibility criteria outlined above might be eligible for special protections and for adaptations and accommodations in 
instruction, facilities, and activities. Children are entitled to  such protections, adaptations, and accommodations if they hav e 
a mental or physical disability that subs tantially limits or prohibits participation  in or access to an aspect of the school 
program and otherwise qualify under the applicable state and federal laws, including Chapter 711 of Title 22 of the 
Pennsylvania Code and Section 504. 
Charter School must ensure that qualified handicapped students ha ve equal opportunity to participate in the School program 
and activities to the maximum extent appropriate for each in dividual student.  In compliance with applicable state and federal 
laws, Charter School provides to each qualifying protected handi capped student without discriminat ion or cost to the student 
or family, those related aids, services or accommodations which are needed to provide equal opportunity to participate in 
and obtain the benefits of the school program and activities to the maximum extent appropriate to the student’s abilities and 
to the extent required by the laws. 
These services and protections for “protected handicapped student s” may be distinct from those applicable to eligible or 
thought-to-be eligible students.  Charter Sc hool or the parent may initiate an ev aluation if they believe a student is a 
protected handicapped student.  For further information on the evaluation procedures and provisi on of services to protected 
handicapped students, parents s hould contact the School’s Director of  Special Education, at: 888-722-9237 
Least Restrictive Environment “LRE”  
To the maximum extent appropriate, stude nts with disabilities are educated with  students who are nondisabled. Special 
classes, separate schoo ling or other removal of students with di sabilities from the general ed ucational envir onment occurs 
only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that  education in general education classes, even with the use of 
supplementary aids and services, cannot be achieved satisfactor ily. A continuum of alternative placements is available to 
meet the needs of students with disabilities for special edu cation and related services as required by applicable state and 
federal regulations.  This is a team decision, which includes the Charter School and the Parents. 
Special education services are provided according to the educatio nal needs of the child, not the category of disability. Types 
of service that may be available, depending upon the child’s  disability and needs as determined by the IEP team might 
include, but are not limited to: (1) learning support; (2) lif e skills support; (3) emotional support; (4) deaf or hearing impa ired 
support; (5) blind or visually impaired support; (6) physical su pport; (7) autistic support; (8) multiple disabilities support;  (9) 
speech and language support; (10) extended school year support. 
 
 
 
 2 Depending on the nature and severity of the disability, C harter School could provide special education programs and 
services as determined appropriate by the IEP team, in locations such as: (1) the classroom/building the child would attend 
if not disabled, (2) an alternative regular class either in or  outside the school, (3) a special education center operated by a n 
IU, (4) an approved private school or other private facility licen sed to serve children with disabilities, (5) a residential sc hool, 
(6) approved out-of-state pr ogram, or (7) the home. 
Related services are designed to enable the child to participate in or access his or her program of special education.  
Examples of some related services that a child may require might include transportation and such developmental, corrective, 
and other supportive services as are required to assist a child  with a disability to benefit from special education, and includ es 
speech-language pathology and audiology services, interpreting services, psychological services, physical and occupational 
therapy, recreati on, including therapeutic recreation , early identification and assessme nt of disabilities in children, 
counseling services, including rehabilitation counseling, or ientation and mobility services, and medical services for 
diagnostic or evaluation purposes.  Related services might also  include school health services and school nurse services, 
social work services in schools, and parent counseling and training. Some students may also be eligible for extended school 
year services if determined needed by their IEP t eams in accordance with Chapter 711 regulations. 
Charter School in conjunction with the parents determines the type and intensity of special education and related services 
that a particular child needs based on the unique program of spec ial education and related servic es that the School develops 
for that child. The child’s program is described in writing in  an individualized education program , or “IEP,” which is develope d 
by an IEP team. The participants in the IEP team are dictated by IDEA 2004. The parents of the child have the right to be 
notified of and to be offered participation in all meetings of their child’s IEP team. The IEP is revised as often as 
circumstances warrant but reviewed at l east annually. The law requires that the program and placement of the child, as 
described in the IEP, be reasonably calculated to ensure meani ngful educational benefit to the student. In accordance with 
IDEA 2004, there may be situations in which the School may hold an IEP team meeting if the parents refuse or fail to attend 
the IEP team meeting. 
IEPs generally contain: (1) a statement of the student’s present levels;  (2) a statement of measurable annual goals 
established for the child; (3) a statement of how the child’s progress toward meeting the annual goals will be measured and 
when periodic reports will be provided; (4 ) a statement of the special education and related services and supplementary 
aids and services and a statement of the program modification s or supports for School personnel that will be provided, if 
any; (5) an explanation of the extent, if any, to which the ch ild will not participate with non-disabled children in the regula r 
class and in activities; (6) a statement of any individual appropriate accommodati ons that are necessary to measure the 
performance of the child on State and School assessments; a nd (7) the projected date for the beginning of the services and 
modifications and the anticipated frequency, location and duration of those services or modifications. 
Beginning not later than the first IEP to be in effect when t he child turns 14, or younger if determined appropriate by the IEP  
Team, and updated annually, thereafter, the IEP must include appropriate measurable postsecondary goals and transition 
services needed to assist in reaching those goals. Charter Scho ol must invite the child to the IEP team meeting at which 
the transition plan is developed. 
Beginning not later than one year before the child reaches t he age of majority under State law, the IEP must include a 
statement that the child has bee n informed of the child’s rights, if any, that will transfer to the child  on reaching the age o f 
majority. 
Screening 
Each educational agency must establish and implement proce dures to locate, identify, and evaluate school age students 
suspected of being eligible for special education.  These procedures include screening activities which include but are not 
limited to: review of group based data (cum ulative records, enrollment records, health records, and report cards); hearing 
screening (at a minimum of kindergarten. first, second, and third grades); vision screens (every grade level); motor 
screening; and speech; and speech and language screening.  This information will be reviewed by a team of school 
personnel to help determine if a disability is suspected Ch arter School has established a system of screening which may 
include pre-referral intervention services to accomplish the following: 
1. Identification and provision of initia l screening for students prior to referr al for a special education evaluation. 
2. Provision of peer support for teachers and other staff members to assist them in working effectively with 
students in the general education curriculum. 
3. Identification of students who may need special education services and programs. 
The screening process includes: 
 
 
 
 3 1. Hearing and vision screening in accordance with Sect ion 1402 of the Public School Code of 1949 (24 P. S. § 
14-1402) for the purpose of identifying students with hearing or vision difficulty so that they can be referred for 
assistance or recommended for evaluation for special education. 
2. Screening at reasonable interval s to determine whether all students are performing based on grade-appropriate 
standards in core academic subjects. 
Charter School has established and implements procedures to  locate, identify and evaluate children suspected of being 
eligible for special education. These proc edures involve screening activities which may also include but are not limited to:  
review of data and student records; motor screening; and sp eech and language screening.  T he school assesses the current 
achievement and performance of the child, designs school-b ased interventions, and assesses the effectiveness of 
interventions.  If the concern can be addressed without specia l education services or is the result of limited English 
proficiency or appropriate inst ruction, a recommendation may be made for interv entions other than a multidisciplinary team 
evaluation. Parents have the right to request  a multidisciplinary team evaluation at  any time, regardless of the outcome of 
the screening process. 
In accordance with Chapter 711, in the event that Charter Sch ool would meet the criteria in 34 CFR 300.646(b)(2) (relating 
to disproportionality), as established by the State Department of Educ ation, the services that would be required would then 
include: 
1. A verification that the student was provided with appr opriate instruction in reading, including the essential 
components of reading instruction (as defined in sect ion 1208(3) of the Elementary and Secondary Education 
Act (ESEA) (20 U.S.C.A. § 6368(3)), an d appropriate instru ction in math. 
2. For students with academic concerns, an assessment of the student's performance in relation to State-
approved grade level standards. 
3. For students with behavioral concerns, a systematic observation of the student's behavior in the school 
environment where the student is displaying difficulty. 
4. A research-based intervention to increase the student 's rate of learning or behavior change based on the 
results of the assessments under pa ragraph (2) or (3), or both. 
5. Repeated assessments of achievement or behavior, or both, conducted at reasonable intervals, reflecting 
formal monitoring of student pr ogress during the interventions. 
6. A determination as to whether the student's assessed diffi culties are the result of a lack of instruction or limited 
English proficiency. 
7. A determination as to whether the student's needs exceed the functional ability of the regular education 
program to maintain the student at an appropriate instructional level. 
8. Documentation that information about the student's progress as identified in paragraph (5) was periodically 
provided to the student's parents. 
Except as indicated above or otherwise announced publicly, screening activities take place on- going at periods throughout 
the school year.  Screening is conducted at Charter Sc hool, unless other arrangements are necessary or arranged. 
The screening of a student by a teacher or specialist to det ermine appropriate instructional strategies for curriculum 
implementation is not to be considered an evaluation fo r eligibility for special education and related services. 
 
 
 
If parents need additional information about the purpose, time, and location of screening activities, they should call or write  
to the Special Education Contact for The Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School: 
Director of Special Education  
722 Midland Avenue 
Midland, PA 15059  
Screening or pre-referral intervention activities may not serve as  a bar to the right of a parent to request an evaluation, at 
any time, including prior to or during the conduct of  screening or pre-referral intervention activities. 
 
 
 
 4 Evaluation 
An evaluation under IDEIA 2004 involves the use of a variet y of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant 
functional, developmental, and academic information about the ch ild, including information provided by the parent that may 
assist in determining whether the child is a child with a disa bility and the content of the ch ild’s IEP.  Charter School does 
not use any single measure or assessment as  a sole criterion for determ ining whether a child is a child with a disability and 
for determining an appropriate educational program for the child .  Technically sound instruments are used to assess the 
relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral fact ors in addition to physical or developmental factors.  
Parental consent must be obtained by Charter School prior to conducting an initial evaluation to determine if the child 
qualifies as a child with a disability, an d before providing special education and rela ted services to the child.  Parental 
consent for an evaluation shall not be construed as consent for their child to receive special education and related services. 
The screening of a child by a teacher or specialist to determine appropriate instructional strategies for curriculum 
implementation is not considered to be an evaluation for eligibility for special edu cation and related se rvices; therefore, 
parental consent is not required in this instance. 
The law contains additional provisions and due process protecti ons regarding situations in which parental consent for an 
initial evaluation is absent or refused di scussed more fully below and in the PaTTA N Procedural Safeguards Notice.  If you 
have any questions about where to obtain a copy of the PaTTA N Procedural Safeguards Notice, kindly contact the Director 
of Special Education, 1200 Midland Avenue, Midland, PA 15059 
The evaluation process is conducted by a Multi-Discipli nary Team (MDT) which is formed based on the student’s needs 
and may include a teacher, other qualified professionals who work  with the child, the parents and other members as required 
by law. The MDE process must be conducted in accordance with specific timelines and must in clude protective procedures.  
For example, tests and procedures used as part of the Multi-Disc iplinary Evaluation may not be racially or culturally biased. 
The MDE process culminates with a written report called an Evaluation Report (ER).  This report makes recommendations 
about a student’s eligibility for special education based on t he presence of a disability and the need for specially designed 
instruction. 
Parents who think their child is eligible for special education may request, at any time, that Charter School conduct a Multi-
Disciplinary Evaluation. Requests for a Mu lti-Disciplinary Evaluation must be made in  writing to the Director of Special 
Education at: 1200 Midland Avenue, Midland, PA 15059 
If a parent makes an oral request for a Multi-Disciplinary Evalua tion, Charter School shall provide the parent with a form(s) 
for that purpose.  If the public school denies the parents’ requ est for an evaluation, the parents have the right to challenge 
the denial through an impartial hearing or through voluntar y alternative dispute resolution such as mediation. 
Reevaluations are conducted if Charter Sc hool determines that the educational or related service needs, including improved 
academic achievement and functional perfor mance, of the child warrant a reevaluation;  or if the child’s parent or teacher 
requests a reevaluation. A reevaluation may occur not more than once a year, unless the parent and Charter School agree; 
and must occur once every 3 years, un less the parent and Charter School agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary.  
Students with intellectual disability must be re evaluated every two years under State law. 
Educational  Placement 
The determination of whether a student is eligible for spec ial education is made by an Individualized Education Program 
(IEP) team.  The IEP team includes:  the parents of a child with  a disability; not less than on e regular educati on teacher, if 
the child is, or may be, participating in the regular educati on environment; not less than one special education teacher, or 
when appropriate, not less than one special education provider; a representative of the school who is qualified to provide 
or supervise the provision of specially designed instruction to meet  the unique needs of children with disabilities, is 
knowledgeable about the general education curriculum, and is know ledgeable about the availabilit y of resources of Charter 
School; an individual who can interpret the instructional implic ations of evaluation results, who may be a member of the 
team described above; other individuals,  at the discretion of the parent or the agency, who have knowledge or special 
expertise regarding the child, including related services pers onnel as appropriate; and whenever appropriate, a child with a 
disability.  Additionally, Charter School must invite the child with a disability to attend the child’s IEP Team meeting if a 
purpose of the meeting includes the c onsideration of the postsecondary goals fo r the child and the transition services 
needed to assist the child in reaching those goals.  If the child does not attend the IEP Team meeting, Charter School must 
take other steps to ensure that the chil d’s preferences and interests are considered .  IEP team participation is directly 
addressed by the regulations.   
 
 
 
 5 A single test or procedure may not be the sole factor in deter mining that a student is exceptio nal. If the student is determine d 
to be eligible for special education, the IEP team develops a written education plan called an IEP.  The IEP shall be based 
on the results of the multidisciplinary eval uation.  The IEP team may decide that a st udent is not eligible for special educati on.  
In that instance, recommendations for educational progra mming in regular education may be developed from the ER.  
An IEP describes a student’s current educational levels, goal s, objectives, and the individualized programs and services, 
which the student will receive.  IEP’s ar e reviewed on an annual basis.  The IEP team will make decisions about the type of 
services, the level of services, the level of intervention, and the location of intervention. 
Placement must be made in the least restrictive environment in which the student’s needs can be met with special education 
and related services.  All students with disabilities must be ed ucated to the maximum extent appropriate with children who 
are not disabled. 
Parents and Surrogate Parents  
For purposes of this Notice, Charter School considers parents to be biological or adoptive parents of a  child;  a  foster  
parent;  a  guardian  generally  authorized  to  act  as  the  child’s  parent,  or authorized to make educational decisions fo r 
the child; an individual acting in the place of a biological  or  adoptive  parent  (including  a  grandparent,  stepparent,  o r  
other  relative)  with whom the child lives, or an individual who is legally responsible for the child’s welfare; or a surrogat e 
parent. 
A surrogate parent must be appointed when no parent can be identified; a public agency, after reasonable efforts, cannot 
locate a parent; the child is a ward of the State under the laws of Pennsylvania, or the child in an unaccompanied homeless 
youth as defined by the McKinney- Vento Homeless Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 11434a(6).   A person selected as a surrogate parent must not be an employee of the SEA, Charter School or any other agency that is involved in the education 
or care of the child; has no personal or professional interest  that conflicts with the interest of the child the surrogate pare nt 
represents; and has knowledge and skills that ensure adequate representation of the child. The surrogate parent may represent the child in all matters relating to the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the child and the 
provision of FAPE to the child. Reasonable efforts must be made to ensure the assignment of a surrogate parent not more than 30 days after it is determined that the child needs a surrogate parent. 
Prior Written Notice  
Charter School will notify the parent whenever School takes the following actions(s), pursuant to the Notice of Recommended 
Educational Placement/Prior Written Notice  (NOREP/PWN), regarding the child’s education program.  For more information, 
see the annotated NOREP/PWN on the PaTTAN website or available at the Charter School office. 
Type of action taken: 
1.  Proposes initial provision of special education and re lated services (For this action, the school may not 
proceed without your consent in Section 8 of this document,) 
2. Refusal to initiate an evaluation (Must issue Procedural Safeguards Notice) 
3. Proposes to change the identification, evaluation or ed ucational placement of the child or the provision of a 
free appropriate public education (FAPE) 
4. Refusal to change the identification, evaluation or educat ional placement of the child or the provision of a free 
and appropriate public education (FAPE) 
5. Change of placement for disciplinary reas ons (Must issue Procedural Safeguards Notice) 
6. Due process hearing, or an expedited due process hearing, initiated by school/district 
7. Graduation from high school

 6 13. Other 
In Pennsylvania, prior written notice is provided by me ans of a Prior Written Notice Form/Notice of Recommended 
Educational Placement (NOREP). You should be given reasonable notice of this proposal or refusal so that if you do not agree with Charter School you may take appropriate action. Reasonable Notice means ten (10) days. 
Pursuant to PaTTAN, the above list is for the LEA to use to communicate to the parents the proposed actions to be taken.  
All actions listed require Prior Written Notice, except the firs t action, (i.e., Proposes initial provision of special educatio n and 
related), which requires parental consent.  When selecting t he first action, the LEA may not proceed without the written 
consent of the parents in Section 8 (Parent al Consent) of the NOREP/PWN.  An initial evaluation may NOT by conducted 
without parental permission.  Perm ission is requested using the Permission to Eval uate – Consent Form.  In the reevaluation 
process, if the parent requests additional data and the LEA dis agrees with the request, the LEA would issue the NOREP/PWN 
with an explanation of the reason for the refusal.  A clarif ication has been added to remind t he LEA that they must issue 
Procedural Safeguards Notice for the following actions:  Refu sal to initiate an evaluation and Change of placement for 
disciplinary reasons. 
 The prior written notice must:  
1. Describe the action that Charter School proposes or refuses to take;  
2. Explain why Charter School is pro posing or refusing to take the action; 
3. Describe each evaluation procedure, assessment, record, or report Charter School used in deciding to 
propose or refuse the action; 
4. Include a statement that you have protections under the procedural safeguards provisions in Part B of IDEA; 
5. Tell how you can obtain a description of the procedural safeguards if the action that Charter School is 
proposing, or refusing is not an initial referral for evaluation; 
6. Include resources for you to contact for help in understanding Part B of the IDEA; 7. Describe any other choices that your child’s IEP Team considered and the reasons why those choices were 
rejected; and 
8. Provide a description of other reasons why Charter School proposed or refused the action. 
The notice must be:  
1. Written in language understandable to the general public;  and 
2. Provided in your native language or other mode of comm unication you use unless it is clearly not feasible to 
do so. 
3. If your native language or other mode of  communication is not a written language,  
4. Charter School will ensure that: 
a. The notice is translated for you orally or by ot her means in your native language or other mode of 
communication; 
b. You understand the content of the notice;  and 
c. There is written evidence that 1 and 2 have been met. 
Native language , when used with an individual who has limited English proficiency, means the following: 
1. The language normally used by that person, or, in the case of a child, the language normally used by the 
child’s parents; 
2. In all direct contact with a child (including evaluation of  a child), the language normally used by the child in the 
home or learning environment. 
For a person with deafness or blindness, or for a person with  no written language, the mode of communication is what the 
person normally uses (such as sign language, Braille, or oral communication). 
Parental Consent  
Consent means: 
 
 
 
 7 1.   You have been fully informed in your native language or other mode of communication (such as sign language, 
Braille, or oral communication) of all information about the action for which consent is sought; 
2.   You understand and agree in writing to that action, and the consent describes that action and lists the records 
(if any) that will be released and to whom; and 
3.   You understand that the granting of consent is vol untary and may be revoked at any time.  However, consent 
does not negate (undo) an action that has occurred after you gave your consent and before you withdrew it. 
If you revoke consent in writing for your child’s receipt of s pecial education services after your child is initially provided 
special education and related services, Charter School is not required to amend your child’s education records to remove 
any references to your child’s receipt of special education and related services because of the revocation of consent. 
Need for Parental Consent 
Initial Evaluations (34 CFR §300.300) 
1. General Rule: Consent for initial evaluation 
Charter School cannot conduct an initial evaluation of your child to determine whether your  child is eligible under 
Part B of the IDEA to receive special education and relat ed services without first providing you with prior written 
notice of the proposed action and without obtaining your consent .  Charter School must make reasonable efforts 
to obtain your informed consent for an initial evaluation to decide whether your child is a child with a disability. 
Your consent for initial evaluation does not mean that you have also given your consent for Charter School to 
start providing special education and related services to your  child. If your child is enrolled in public school or 
you are seeking to enroll your child in a public school and you have refused to provide consent or failed to 
respond to a request to provide consent for an initial evaluation, Charter School may, but is not required to, seek 
to conduct an initial evaluation of your child by utilizing the Act’s mediation or due process complaint, resolution meeting, and impartial due process hearing procedures.  Ch arter School will not violate its obligations to locate, 
identify and evaluate your child if it does not pursue an evaluation of your child in these circumstances. 
2. Special rules for initial evaluation of wards of the State 
Under Pennsylvania law, if a child is designated a ward  of the state, the whereabouts of the parent are not 
known or the rights of the parent have been terminated in accordance with State law. Therefore, someone other 
than the parent has been designated to make educational decisions for the child. Consent for an initial evaluation should, therefore, be obtained from the individual so designated. 
3. Ward of the State , as used in the IDEA, encompasses two other categories, so as to include a child who is: 
a. A foster child who does not have a foster parent; b. Considered a ward of the State under State law; or 
c. In the custody of a public child welfare agency. 
Consent for Initial Placement in Special Education (34 CFR §300.300)  
1. Definitions of Parental Consent: 
a. You have been fully informed in your native language or other mode of communication (such as 
sign language, Braille, or oral communication) of all information about the action for which consent is sought; 
b. You understand and agree in writing to that action, and the consent describes that action and lists 
the records (if any) that will be released and to whom; and 
c. You understand that the consent does not negat e (undo) an action that has occurred after you gave 
your consent and before you withdrew it. 
2. Can the Parent Revoke Consent? 
a. Yes.  You must submit written documentation to the staff revoking consent for special education and 
related services; 
b. When you revoke consent for special education and related services, Charter School must provide 
you with Prior Written Notice; 
 
 
 
 8 c. Special education and related services cannot cease until Charter School provides you with Prior 
Written Notice; 
d. Prior notice is defined as ten calendar days;  
e. Charter School staff cannot use mediation or due process to override your revocation of consent; 
f. Charter School will not be considered in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available to the 
child because of the failure to provide the child wi th further special education and related services; 
g. Charter School is not required to amend the chil d’s educational records to remove any references 
to the child’s receipt of special education and related services because of the revocation of consent; 
and 
h. Charter School is not required to convene an IEP team meeting or develop an IEP for the child for 
further provision of special education and related services. 
 
3. Parental Consent for Services 
Charter School must obtain your informed consent before providing special education and related services to 
your child for the first time. Charter School must make  reasonable efforts to obtain your informed consent 
before providing special education and related services to your child for the first time. 
If you do not respond to a request to provide your consent for your child to receive special education and related 
services for the first time, or if you refuse to give such consent, Charter School may not use the procedural 
safeguards (i.e. mediation, due process complaint, resolution meeting, or an impartial due process hearing) in 
order to obtain agreement or a ruling that the special education and related services as recommended by your 
child’s IEP Team may be provided to your child without your consent. 
If you refuse to give your consent for your child to start receiving special education and related services, or if 
you do not respond to a request to provide such consent and Charter School does not provide your child with 
the special education and related services for which it sought your consent, Charter School: 
a.   Is not in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available to your child for its failure to provide those 
services to your child; and 
b.   Is not required to have an IEP meeting or develop an IEP for your child for the special education and 
related services for which your consent was requested. 
Consent for Reevaluations (34 CFR §300.300)  
Charter School must obtain your informed consent before it reevaluates your child, unless Charter School can demonstrate 
that: 
1. It took reasonable steps to obtain your consent for your child’s reevaluation;  and 
2. You did not respond. 
Documentation of Reasonable Efforts to Obtain Parental Consent (34 CFR §300.300)  
Charter School will take steps to ensure that one or both  of the parents of a child with a disability are present at each IEP 
Team meeting or are afforded the opportunity to participate, including: 
1. Notifying parents of the meeting early enough to ensure that they will have the opportunity to attend; and 2. Scheduling the meeting at a mutually agreed upon time and place. 
If Charter School is unable to convince parents to attend an IEP Team meeting, the meeting may still be conducted; 
however, Charter School must maintain documentation of reasonable efforts to obtain parental consent for initial evaluations, to provide special education and related services for the first time, to reevaluate and to locate parents of wards  
of the State for initial evaluations. The documentation must include a record of Charter School’s attempts in these areas, such as: 
1. Detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the results of those calls; 
2. Copies of correspondence sent to the parents and any responses received; and 
3. Detailed records of visits made to the parent’s home or place of employment and the results of those visits. 
 
 
 
 9 Consent Not Required Related to Evaluation  
Your consent is not required before Charter School may: 
1. Review existing data as part of your child’s evaluation or a reevaluation;  or 
2. Give your child a test or other evaluation that is gi ven to all children unless, before that test or evaluation, 
consent is required from all parents of all children. 
Refused Consent to a Reevaluation  
If you refuse to consent to your child’s reevaluation, Charter School may, but is not required to, pursue your child’s 
reevaluation by using the mediation, due process complaint,  resolution meeting, and impartial due process hearing 
procedures to seek to override your refusal to consent to your  child’s reevaluation. As with initial evaluations, Charter Schoo l 
does not violate its obligations under Part B of the IDEA if it declines to pursue the reevaluation in this manner. 
Charter School may not use your refusal to consent to one service or activity to deny you or your child any other service, 
benefit, or activity. 
Disagreements with an Evaluation/ Independent Educational Evaluations (34 CFR §300.502)  
1. General  
As described below, you have the right to obtain an independent educational evaluation (IEE) of your child if 
you disagree with the evaluation of your child that was obtained by Charter School. If you request an IEE, Charter School must provide you with information about where you may obtain an IEE and about Charter 
School’s criteria that apply to IEEs. 
2. Definitions 
a. Independent educational evaluation means an evaluation conducted by a qualified examiner who is not 
employed by Charter School responsible for the education of your child. 
b. Public expense means that Charter School either pays for the full cost of the evaluation or ensures that 
the evaluation is otherwise provided at no cost to y ou, consistent with the provisions of Part B of the 
IDEA, which allow each State to use whatever State, local, Federal and private sources of support are 
available in the State to meet the requirements of Part B of the Act. 
3. Parent Right to Evaluation at Public Expense 
You have the right to an Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE) of your child at public expense if you disagree 
with an evaluation of your child obtained by Ch arter School, subject to the following conditions: 
a. If you request an IEE of your child at public expense, Charter School must, without unnecessary delay, 
either:  (a) File a due process complaint to request a hearing to show that its evaluation of your child is 
appropriate; or (b) Provide an IEE at public expense, unless Charter School demonstrates in a hearing that the evaluation of your child that you obtained did not meet Charter School’s criteria. 
b. If Charter School requests a hearing and the final decision is that Charter School’s evaluation of your 
child is appropriate, you still have the right to an IEE, but not at public expense. 
c. If you request an IEE of your child, Charter School may ask why you object to the evaluation of your 
child obtained by Charter School. However, Charter School may not require an explanation and may 
not unreasonably delay either providing the IEE of your child at public expense or filing a due process complaint to request a due process hearing to defend Charter School’s evaluation of your child. 
d. You are entitled to only one IEE of your ch ild at public expense each time Charter School  conducts an 
evaluation of your child with which you disagree.  
e. If an IEE is at public expense, the criteria under which the evaluation is obtained, including the location 
of the evaluation and the qualifications of the examin er, must be the same as the criteria that Charter 
School uses when it initiates an evaluation (to the extent those criteria are consistent with your right to an IEE). Except for the criteria described above, Charter School may not impose conditions or timelines 
related to obtaining an IEE at public expense. 
5. Parent-initiated evaluations 
 
 
 
 10 If you obtain an IEE of your child at public expense or you share with Charter School an evaluation of your child 
that you obtained at private expense: 
a. Charter School must consider the results of the evaluation of your child, if it meets Charter School’s 
criteria for IEEs, in any decision made with respect to the provision of FAPE to your child; and 
b. You or Charter School may present the evaluation as evidence at a due process hearing regarding your 
child. 
6. Requests for evaluations by hearing officers 
If a hearing officer requests an IEE of your child as part  of a due process hearing, the cost of the evaluation 
must be at public expense. 
Services for Protected Handicapped Students 
Students who are not eligible to receive special education pr ograms and services may qualify as handicapped students and 
therefore be protected under federal stat utes and regulations intended to prevent discrimination (in particular, 34 CFR Part 
104 and 28 CFR Part 35).  PA Cyber must ensure that qualifi ed handicapped students have equal opportunity to participate 
in the school program and extracurricular activities to t he maximum extent appropriate fo r each individual student as 
required by law.  In compliance with federal laws PA Cy ber will provide to each protected handicapped student without 
discrimination or cost to the student of family, those relat ed aids, services or accommodations which are needed to provide 
equal opportunity to participate in and obtain the benefits of the school program and extracurricular activities to the maximum  
extent appropriate to the student ’s abilities.  In order to qualify as a prot ected handicapped student, t he student must be of 
school age with a physical or mental disab ility, which substantially limits or prohib its participation in or access to an aspec t 
of the school program. 
These services and protections for “protected handicapped student s” may be distinct from those applicable to eligible or 
thought to be eligible students.  The parent may initiate an evaluation if the parent believ es a student is a protected 
handicapped student.  For further information on the evaluation pr ocedures and provision of services handicapped students, 
parents should contact the Special Education Contact.

01. AAC in the General Education Classroom: Inquiry and Inclusion 
Sarah Gregory, M.S. CCC -SLP  
  
Every student has a right to be authentically included in the mainstream or general 
education classroom, but this does not come without challenges. This session will 
explore strategies to support AAC users in mainstream environments, both socially and academically. We will discuss peer support and how AAC can be integrated into the classroom in a way that benefits all learners. We will also examine inquiry -style teaching 
and the descriptive teaching model and how these techniques can be used to differentiate academics for all learners. This session will be fun and full of practical ideas to provide all students with meaningful interactions with the curriculum as well as the social aspects of a classroom.

02. The Connection between Learning Theory and Student Progress: Reducing 
Barriers to Success  
Leslie Thatcher, EdM  
This session will introduce participants to foundational ideas about how students learn, in order to help educators recognize when a challenge may be related to visual 
impairment or may be related to another challenge such as possible learning disability, ADHD, executive functioning weakness,  or autism. A greater understanding of how students learn will help educators to recognize when to include the student’s broader team to address challenges a student may have that may impact their ability to learn 
blindness skills and thus, advance on pace with their peers.  Participants will gain a 
greater understanding of the impact of their work in supporting students to improve 
academic performance, creating greater opportunities for a more rigorous curriculum, greater self -awareness, and transition planning that integrates a student’s entire 
experience of learning.

et’s Talk About It: Best Practice for Providing Students with Low Incidences 
Sexuality Education  
Rebekkah Abeyta  
 
 Students with low incidences are often left out of the conversation about sexuality, 
almost as if they are incapable of having thoughts, feelings, and needs. In reality, they, too, are sexual beings that need information and skills for making healthy decis ions 
about sexuality. This workshop will help you become more comfortable talking about this sensitive topic by discussing what needs to be taught when and how to help people 
with developmental disabilities have safe- satisfying relationships.

hy Deaf -Blindness and Autism Spectrum Disorders Look So Much Alike  
Julie Maier, MA  
The similarities in the ways that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and deafblindness 
present in children have been recognized for a long time, as have diagnostic strategies for differentiating between autism and deafness. Families and educators serving children with deafblindness increasingly hear other educators, service providers, or medical specialists say that these children seem to act autistic or to have “autistic -like 
behaviors.” While it is possible for children to be both deafblind and be diagnosed with autism, it is much more likely that a child who is deafblind simply appears similar to a child with autism and, conversely, the child with autism might appear to have certain features consistent with deafblindness. The purpose of this webinar is to look closely at 
the key features of ASD and deafblindness and consider why children who are deafblind 
might, in some cases, share many of the same features associated with ASD and how vision and hearing loss and other sensory impairments can explain these “autistic -like” 
features.

 A UDL Approach to Strengthening Collaboration 
Nicole Tucker -Smith  
This interactive session will apply a Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Approach to 
strengthening and sustaining professional collaboration between general and special educators. Participants will explore UDL core ideas and how they relate to adult learner variability, removing barriers to collaboration, and flexible options to support a range of 
specializations and contexts. Participants will take away concrete strategies and 
resources that they can apply to their special education - general education teams and 
partnerships.

 Executive Functioning: Foundational Skills for the Educator (and Student )  
Leslie Thatcher, EdM  
As students grow and progress through the K -12 system, assumptions are made about 
their ability to organize their time, assignments, social engagements, and emotional 
reactions.  These are all skills related to executive functions. Some students intuitivel y 
develop these skills, yet they are often learned through incidental learning, and not 
explicitly taught. Many students benefit from explicitly structured work to develop 
executive functioning skills -and students learning with a visual impairment are no 
different.  Learn the basics about executive functioning, and learn how to integrate 
these skills into your work. This session will involve some hands -on work to explore the 
implications of these key skills, and how to increase your student's executive func tions.  
This session can be taken separately from the previous session, or in combination with the prior session.

ilding Bridges Between Best Practices & I nterventions for ASD and 
Deafblindness  
Julie Maier, MA  
 
 
Page 9 
In this session we’ll look closely at current evidence- based practices related to the 
instruction of learners with autism spectrum disorder and compare those practices to 
highly recognized field- based best practices related to deafblind education. This 
presentation will outline the unique educational needs of a learner who is deafblind and 
offer suggestions for how to match and tailor certain evidence- based ASD practices with 
deafblind practices when planning instruction and support for a learner who is deafblind. Particular attention will be paid to the areas of appropriate access to the curriculum and social relationships, communication skill development, concept development, sensory regulation, and self -determination skills.

. Navigating The Career Road: Optimizing Employment Outcomes For Students 
Who Are Deaf  
Kristopher Koberlein  
 
 In this workshop, participants will learn  ab out the importance of transition planning in 
helping students who are deaf and or hard of hearing to plan for and navigate the career 
road in an effort to obtain and maintain competitive employment. Too often for youth who are deaf and hard of hearing, the career road is marked by detours as they are 
more apt to experience issues related to unemployment or underemployment as they 
attempt to enter and maintain employment in the workforce. This is despite a willingness to want to work competitively in the workforce after gaining the necessary education, training, and skills.

Vocabulary and background knowledge building (schema) can significantly impact 
reading, writing, and communication with AAC users. You need words, and to 
understand words, to use words in shared reading and writing experiences. We will dive 
into the research from Comprehensive Literacy for ALL and The Science of Reading.  The following tools and strategies will be highlighted; The Expanding Expression 
Tool™, Descriptive Teaching Techniques, Canva™, Alternative Pencil, Readtopia™, 
(however, any Literacy curriculum can be used), and Youtube™. When these tools and 
strategies are combined with EBPs, participants will be given practical strategies on how all students can be active participants in their journey of learning to read and write. 
It begins with presumed competence, evidence- based practices (EBP’s), and 
meaningful activities!

 14. Modeling ASL for Young Deaf/HoH Children 
K. Crom Saunders  
Young Deaf/HoH children often face challenges in language acquisition, due to a plethora of factors ranging from lack of resources, lack of language models, parenting decisions, school system structuring, and so on. Oftentimes their first and sometimes only language model(s) for using ASL are professionals working in Deaf/HoH and 
Special education programs.  For the younger ages, there is often very little foundation for any language development, in English, ASL, or any other primary languages. Teaching/interpreting curriculum content, while simultaneously teaching th e 
fundamentals of ASL is a difficult challenge, but not impossible.  This workshop will 
demonstrate techniques and tools to expose young Deaf/HoH children to language-
based concepts and meaning, bridging language gaps in ASL, and allowing them to develop their expressive skills naturally.

Alternate Assessment  
Alicia Cuttle, Susan Lefeber, and Christa Reida  
Each day, professionals are presented with a barrage of online information – e mails, 
newsletters, advertisements about curriculum and resources, and more.  It can be overwhelming to know which resources are key to delivering English Language Arts, mathematics, and science standards.  Teachers of students with the most significant 
cognitive disabilities may experience greater challenges identifying resources and 
delivering accessible standards and content.  In 2020, the PA Department of Education, 
Bureau of Special Education (BSE) adopted a new assessment system that includes key reso urces for teachers of students with significant cognitive disabilities.  Join the 
BSE and Dynamic Learning Maps (DLM) as the team provides a ‘walk through’ of content, instructional resources, and assessment tools that can help with planning, teaching, and  assessing.

19. Collaborative Consultation: Effective Communication for  Low-Incidence 
Service Providers  
Britt Coffey, Ph.D.  
Although teachers of students who are deaf or hard of hearing (TSDHH) spend a great 
deal of their time consulting with adults, the skills needed to do this successfully are 
often overlooked in TSDHH preparation programs. Teachers of students who are deaf 
or hard of hearing find consultation increasingly part of the job due to the national trend toward inclusion, which has been accelerated in the field of deaf education by the implementation of universal  newborn hearing screening and advances in technology 
that have included digital hearing aids, cochlear implants, and hearing assistive technology systems (Berndsen & Luckner, 2012). As a result, deaf and hard- of-hearing 
students are increasingly educated by general education teachers. Today, over 87 percent of students with hearing loss spend at least part of their day in a mainstream classroom (U.S. Department of Education, 2016), making in- school support from 
TSDHH more common.  
 
 T
his presentation takes a big-picture approach and uses best practices from related 
fields to teach negotiation, conflict resolution, and effective consultation skills. 
Consultation skills are presented as relevant to the work of the teacher of the deaf in a 
mainstream setting. Participants can expect to leave this presentation with a better understanding of how to effectively work with other school professionals.

23. Trading in The One -Time In -Service for Consistent Communication With 
Teams  
Britt Coffey, Ph.D. and Emily Snow, M.Ed.  
Today, most students with hearing loss receive the majority of their instruction in a 
general education classroom (U.S. Department of  Education, 2015). Because only 1% 
of students are on an IEP because of hearing loss, most general teacher preparation programs do not spend much time teaching about this unique, heterogeneous group. As a result, general education teachers report feeling unprepared for teaching these students (Eriks- Brophy & Whittingham, 2013), and school staff may misunderstand or 
underestimate the needs of students who are deaf or hard of hearing (Miller, 2014).  
This is where teachers of students who are deaf or hard of hearing (TSDHH) come in. The role of TSDHH is becoming increasingly focused on indirect service (Miller, 2014). Training provided by TSDHH can improve preparedness and help classroom teachers 
feel more positively about inclusion (Sari, 2007).  
 
C
ommonly, TSD HH provide “in -service training” for teachers at the beginning of the 
school year to talk about student needs, teaching strategies, and accommodations/modifications. However, research on professional development for 
teachers shows that one- time team training is often ineffective. In order for professional 
development to create lasting change, it should incorporate active learning and be of "sustained duration" (Darling- Hammond, Hyler, & Gardner, 2017).  
This presentation will focus on concrete ways to structure and sustain consistent communication with teams.

. The 3 R's: Promoting Reasoning, Real -Life Function, and Resilience in 
Adolescents with TBI  
Lori Cook, Ph.D., CCC- SLP  
 Adolescents with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often have a variety of cognitive-
communication deficits and dynamic needs across the continuum of recovery, due to 
ongoing development and increasing cognitive demands, that can make generalization of skills f rom one context to another challenging. The goal of this session is to describe 
some evidence- based approaches for the assessment and remediation of later -
emerging cognitive deficits after pediatric brain injury. The presentation will focus on novel approaches, such as strategy -based reasoning training, and technology 
applications that offer promise in the characterization and remediation of real -life 
challenges for youth with brain injury in the longer term. An emphasis will be placed on 
forward -thinking applications to maximize learning potential and higher -order cognitive 
skills (e.g., executive functioning, social cognition, resilience- building, etc.) as well as 
lifelong brain health; including practical tips, case study examples, and opportunities for 
questions and group discussion.

6. Making Connections with Feature Matching  
Tammy Thompson- Cooke and Tammy Bertel  
Despite the legal mandate to consider assistive technology (AT) for students with 
disabilities, many teams struggle with making the connection between technology features and what students need. A term often used to describe matching a product's features to an individual’s needs and preferences is "feature matching." This session 
will cover the AT consideration process, how free frameworks and assessment tools 
can be used to determine needs and preferences, how feature matching can be used to decide which tool(s) will be most appropriate for activities, and make connections for developing action plans and incorporating this information into evaluations.

renovation by prioritizing areas for brainstorming and planning, facilitating all team 
members’ input, including the student, and enabl ing action planning and follow up 
support. The resulting process is called the Framework for Action and Belonging (FAB), 
and consists of surveying team members, developing a plan for implementation and 
monitoring the student’s progress.  During the session, participants will be provided with an overview of the foundational concepts of the FAB process and a tour of the revised

 28. Interoception, the 8th Sense: Nurturing Self -Regulation & Mental Health from 
the Inside -Out 
Kelly Mahler, OTD, OTR/L  
Interoception is an important sensory system that helps us to feel internal body signals 
like an empty stomach, tense muscles, or racing heart. Research indicates that these internal body signals provide valuable clues to how we feel and what our body uniquely needs for regulation and comfort. For example: Are we Anxious? Overwhelmed? 
Hungry? Full? In pain? Many people can experience interoception confusion and 
disconnect, including clients that have experienced trauma. This session will provide an overview of what the latest research tells us about interoception as well as how this sense influences areas such as self -regulation and mental health. Several strategies for 
assessing and nurturing interoception growth and inner connection will be shared.

 29. Promoting Communication and Peer Relationships for Students Learning to 
Use AAC  
Eliza beth Biggs, Ph.D.  
Positive peer relationships are important for all children and youth, including students with disabilities who have complex communication needs and who are learning to use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) such as speech -generating 
devices. Yet, many questions arise for teachers or service providers working with 
students with complex communication needs. What role do adults have in promoting 
students’ communication and engagement with peers? Can adults do anything to suppor t the development of stronger peer relationships? Is it reasonable to strive for 
mutual friendships, or will peer relationships always look more like “helper” relationships 
for students with significant disabilities? Are there ways to better integrate AAC into 
peer interactions? Can interventions involving peers help students build communication and language skills? This session will answer all of these questions and more by sharing tips and implementation steps that come from our team’s multi -year research 
project focused on enhancing social communication, engagement, and peer relationships for elementary -aged students and their peers. Attendees can expect to 
come away from the session with practical guidance and tools to implement peer network interventions as a way to help their students grow their communication skills 
while forming positive relationships and friendships with their peers without disabilities.

30. 21st Rigorous Expanded Core  
Robbin Clark, MA  
The goal of the Expanded Core should be to help produce interdependent individuals 
who are self -reliant and contributors to today’s world. In order to accomplish this, our 
students must have deep and meaningful connections to the world around them as well as real essential core skills of 21st -century learning such as critical thinking.  We need 
to upgrade our instruction to an authentic approach that supports applying and transferring skills. There is too much of the Expanded Core that is taught in fragment ed 
scenarios where students are disabled to transfer skills and knowledge from one 
environment to the next.

31. Grow Your Toolbox: Outcome Writing Assessments for Students with 
Complex Learning Needs  
Janet Sturm, Ph.D., Ph.D., CCC -SLP, ASHA- F, BCSCL  
 
E
ducators have a growing appreciation of the need for science- based writing instruction 
for students with complex learning needs (CLN). As a result, authentic academic 
measures are being sought to drive and align this high- quality instruction with standards 
and measure progress. In this session, you will discover how the Developmental Writing Scale (DWS), partnered with additional writing measures, can reframe how educational teams conceptualize and work with beginning writers of all ages, many with complex 
learning needs.  The progress monitoring outcome measures shared in this session can 
be used by school teams to identify present performance levels, establish goals, design instruction, and monitor  progress. Participants will hear case studies and classroom 
examples applying the assessment tools to increase academic success!

Kerry Lueders, MS, COMS, TVI, CLVT, and Elise Ciner, O.D.  
For decades, Teachers of Students with Visual Impairments (TVIs) have been called upon to evaluate children who have been recommended for vision therapy.  This session will prepare participants to understand the differences between vision therapy services and ed ucational visual impairment services.  Case study discussions will serve 
to further elucidate the complexities and overlaps between vision therapy and educational visual impairment services and how eligibility for special education may be impacted.

5. Grow Your Toolbox: Leveraging Science to Improve Writing for Students with 
Complex Needs  
Janet Sturm, Ph.D., Ph.D., CCC -SLP, ASHA- F, BCSCL  
The ability to write has enormous power for all students, especially those with complex 
learning needs. The good news is that decades of research across the world have given us a preponderance of evidence to inform how reading and writing develop. Given that 
the pandemic has resulted in significant reductions in instruction and student backslide, 
using science to increase instructional efficacy and efficiency, and optimize student outcomes, is essential. Learn how all students, especially those with complex learning needs, can become authors when systematic, sequential, and explicit instruction is anchored in the science of writing. This session will also show how the not -so-simple 
view of writing can help practitioners assess the knowledge, skills, and curriculum materials needed to improve evidence- based practice in written language. Classroom -
based videos and student examples will be shared throughout the session. Participants will see how assessment data,  partnered with high- quality instruction, enables changes 
in the mindset that written language is an important form of communication for ALL individuals.

7. Putting It All Together: The Deaf -Blind Resource Teams Training Process  
Melissa Kenderes, Kimberly Uccenllini, MA, CCC -A, Kelse y Sprenkle, Daniel Currie, 
Kelly Lauer  
Providing high- quality instruction and support services to students with combined vision 
and hearing needs requires thoughtful collaboration between many professionals with a 
variety of different backgrounds. School  teams often require technical assistance in 
order to expand their knowledge and skills surrounding this unique population of 
learners. One approach to providing this needed technical assistance is through the development of Deaf -Blind Resource Teams (DBRTs). In this session, attendees will 
learn about the Deaf -Blind Resource Team Training Process from some of its original 
participants. Members of the IU 3 and IU 23 DBRTs will share their experiences in the DBRT training process, lessons learned, and some i mplications for future practice.

8. Expectations High Enough for Movement?: Students who are Blind/VI or 
DeafBlind  
Elizabeth Foster, Ph.D., CAPE (presenting in person; in person and virtual attendees)  
The sensory systems of auditory and visual information are used in conjunction with 
vestibular and proprioception feedback to the brain in order to perform appropriate movements. These sensory systems aid an important role in postural stability and 
feedback to where the body is in space and how to best respond to the environment and movement. Come learn effective instructional strategies and interventions designed for stu dents and youth with blindness, visual impairments, or deafblindness to increase 
movement opportunities and maintain high expectations of motor performance. 
Attendees will be able to advocate for accessible movement programs, learn about the 
benefits of mo vement and movement breaks throughout their day, and be able to adapt 
physical activities for safe and successful participation.
