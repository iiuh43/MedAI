DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE OF THE CLINICAL SERVICE GUIDE 
The Clinical Service Guide (CSG) contains clinical protocols for local health department (LHD) nurses that have 
been identified as Core Public Health Services by the Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH). The 
purpose of this document is to clearly identify minimum program/grant requirements and provide information that 
will support LHD operation.
This reference contains guidelines and protocols for LHD to use in providing services. Each section is divided into 
two categories: clinical protocol for a LHD nurse and information required for LHD patient case management. 
Sections of this document may contain medically approved guidelines or protocols as required by regulation. 
Guidelines are recommendations for patient management that identify and/or support the use of a range of patient 
care interventions and approaches. Protocols are authoritative statements requiring a physician’s signature. In 
addition to these guidelines, nurses providing WIC services will follow all the federally approved WIC guidelines, 
policies and procedures in the WIC and Nutrition Services Manual and the Administrative Reference for WIC 
services.
These guidelines and protocols represent levels of care considered appropriate for staff at LHDs and are intended 
to be used without modification unless a higher level of care is desired and supported at the local level. It is the 
responsibility of local staff, as appropriate, to develop additional guidelines and protocols that are desired at the 
local level. The Clinical Service Guide is not all-inclusive and does not supersede professional judgment, or the 
Kentucky Nurse Practice Act.

Health Equity 
July 2023 
HEALTH EQUITY 
The Commonwealth faces many challenges in health outcomes, as evidenced by state health rankings, 
KyBRFS and disparities in health status between populations in Kentucky. The factors that contribute to 
Kentucky’s overall health challenges are influenced by the conditions, in which we live, work and play 
know as social determinants of health (SDoH). These include education, physical and built environment, 
neighborhood, socioeconomic status, social connectedness, and access to health care. Every facet of 
care provided by the local health department should include addressing and mitigating health inequities, 
SDoH, policies and processes and other barriers to care in efforts to improve linkage to resources and 
services to achieve optimal health for all Kentuckians. 
For more information, please contact the Office of Health Equity at 502-564-3970.

Breast Cancer Screening 
 
 
Early diagnosis of breast cancer offers women more treatment options and greatly reduces mortality. 
Early diagnosis is aided by the triad of breast self-awareness, and when indicated or age-appropriate, a 
clinical breast exam (CBE), and regular mammography screening. 
BREAST CANCER RISK FACTORS: 
• 
Female age 40 or older; risk increases with age 
• 
First degree relative (mother, sister, daughter) with a history of breast cancer before the age of 50 
(pre-menopausal) or a close relative* with a male breast cancer or with a known BRCA (Breast 
Cancer Susceptibility Gene) mutation, or if the patient herself has a known BRCA mutation. 
(*See section entitled “GENETIC COUNSELING/TESTING” for a definition of close relative.) 
• 
Personal or family history of genetic syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome 
• 
Personal history of breast cancer or a benign breast condition 
• 
Dense breasts 
• 
History of radiation treatments to the chest wall 
• 
Early menarche (prior to age 12) 
• 
Late menopause (after age 55) 
• 
No pregnancies, or first pregnancy after age 30 
• 
Hormone use: some oral contraceptives and combination (estrogen and progestin used together) 
hormone replacement therapy 
• 
Use of the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) or intrauterine exposure to it 
• 
Overweight/Obese (especially after menopause) 
• 
Lack of physical activity 
• 
Alcohol consumption: risk increases with amount of alcohol consumed 
 
BREAST SCREENING HISTORY 
• 
Include dates and results of previous mammograms 
• 
Elicit personal history of breast symptoms, including pain, tenderness, nipple discharge, palpable 
mass, or skin changes 
• 
Document any personal history of breast cancer and previous biopsies or treatments 
• 
Screen for risk factors (listed above) 
 
BREAST SELF-AWARENESS, BREAST CANCER RISK ASSESSMENT, CLINICAL BREAST 
EXAMINATION AND MAMMOGRAPHY 
• 
All females should be counseled on breast self-awareness (BSA) beginning at age 21. 
Counseling shall be documented in the medical record (e.g., “Breast Self-Awareness counseling 
provided”). 
• 
All women should undergo breast cancer risk assessment by age 25; update as needed. 
• 
CBE: 
o 
A clinical breast exam (CBE) may be offered* during the cancer screening visit to 
asymptomatic, average-risk women beginning at age 25 years (offered every 1-3 years 
for ages 25-39; offered annually to ages 40 and older). 
          9
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
*Offered in the context of informed decision-making, recognizing the 
uncertainty of additional benefits/harms of CBE beyond screening 
mammography. (Adapted from ACOGPractice Bulletin 179, July 2017) 
 
o 
A CBE is recommended for high-risk women or any woman who presents with 
symptoms. 
o 
If an outside provider performed the previous CBE, thorough documentation of the exam 
done by that provider must be obtained, reviewed by the examining nurse at the LHD, 
and placed in the patient’s chart. 
o 
The required method for performing the CBE is using the principles of positioning, three 
levels of palpation, and the vertical strip search pattern. 
• 
During their cancer screening visits, women shall be informed to report any changes in their 
breasts noticed between visits to the Nurse Case Manager (NCM) at the local health department 
(LHD) as soon as possible. 
• 
For average-risk women, the LHD will follow the breast cancer screening guidelines 
recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for 
mammography screening: 
 
Ages 40-49: The decision to start screening mammography in women prior to age 50 
should be an individual one. Women who place a higher value on the potential benefit 
than the potential harm may choose to begin biennial screening mammography between 
the ages of 40-49. 
 
Ages 50-74: Women ages 50-74 years of age should have biennial screening 
mammography. 
 
Note: These guidelines are intended to guide screening of the general population. High-risk 
women will follow different, more frequent screening guidelines. If a woman over the age of 74 is 
still in good health and requests to continue biennial screening she should be allowed to do so. 
 
• 
Trans-gender women (male to female) have different routine screening recommendations. For 
this population it is recommended that screening mammography for average-risk women be 
performed every 2 years, once the woman has reached the age of 50 and has been on feminizing 
hormones at least 5 years. If there are no other risk factors (e.g., positive family history, 
BMI>35), provider and patient may agree to delay screening until the patient has been on 
feminizing hormones for up to 10 years. 
• 
Trans-gender men (female to male) who have not undergone a bilateral mastectomy should 
follow the same screening guidelines as non-transgender women. Prior to bilateral mastectomy, 
transgender men who meet all other KWCSP eligibility requirements can have their breast cancer 
screening and diagnostic services reimbursed through the program. Once a transgender man 
has undergone a bilateral mastectomy, he will no longer qualify for KWCSP breast services 
reimbursement; a qualified clinician should determine his breast cancer screening needs. 
 
Note: Transgender breast screening guidelines adopted from the consensus recommendations 
from The Center of Excellence for Transgender Health and the World Professional Association for 
Transgender Health 
 
• 
A woman with breast implants will follow a routine (non-high risk) screening schedule, unless she 
is symptomatic. The mammography provider should be made aware of the implants, as extra 
views (e.g., implant displacement views) may need to be taken. 
          10
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
• 
Women under the age of 40 who are either symptomatic, or asymptomatic but have been 
determined to be high-risk, can be evaluated with CBE, mammogram, and/or surgical consult. 
These services can be reimbursed with KWCSP funds for eligible women. 
• 
Screening of women at high-risk: 
o 
Women who are at high risk of developing breast cancer should be screened with both 
an annual mammogram and annual breast MRI, unless a provider orders a different 
screening. 
o 
Women assessed to be at high risk for breast cancer generally should begin screening at 
age 30, unless otherwise noted (below). 
o 
A woman is at high risk if any of the following are true: 
 She has a lifetime risk of 20% or more for development of breast cancer, based 
on risk assessment models such as BRCAPRO, Claus, or Tyrer-Cuzick (IBIS), 
that are largely dependent on family history 
 
Note: Risk assessment tools might not always be used to complete 
assessments, but as an option, a simple one can be found here . 
 
 She has a first-degree relative with pre-menopausal breast cancer (If no KNOWN 
family history of genetic mutations, begin screening 10 years younger than the 
age of the youngest family member when diagnosed, but not before age 30). 
 She has a KNOWN genetic mutation, such as BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 gene 
mutation, or is untested but has a first degree relative (mother, sister, daughter) 
with a KNOWN genetic mutation (This population should begin screening at age 
25; ages 25-30 in this group should be referred to contracted gynecologist 
annually for assessment/consultation/screening orders.) 
 
Note: If the physician orders only a breast MRI for screening on a KWCSP- 
eligible woman, please contact KWCSP Nurse Consultant, Colleen Toftness: 
Colleen.Toftness@ky.gov . 
 
 She has a history of receiving radiation treatments to the chest wall between the 
ages of 10 and 30 years. (Begin annual screening 8 years after radiation was 
completed, but not younger than age 30) 
 She has a history of pre-cancer/cancer of the breast. (Post-mastectomy women 
will have a diagnostic mammogram of the opposite breast.) 
• 
Any woman with an abnormal CBE should be referred for either a diagnostic mammogram 
(usually for women aged 30 and older) or ultrasound (often preferred for women under the age of 
30 due to their typically dense breasts, but the radiologist may choose to do a diagnostic 
mammogram for the younger-age woman as well). 
• 
In menstruating women, the mammogram should be scheduled about 2 weeks after the LMP. 
 
 
MAGNETIC Resonance imaging (MRI) 
Women in the high-risk category will be screened with an annual MRI as well as an annual mammogram. 
Otherwise, determination of the need for MRI for patients will be made by the contracted breast surgeon 
or radiologist. 
• 
KWCSP will reimburse breast MRI when performed in conjunction with a mammogram when a 
client is considered “high risk” as determined in the previous section. However, KWCSP will not 
reimburse breast MRI when performed alone as a screening tool. 
          11
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
• 
KWCSP will reimburse breast MRI when used to better assess areas of concern on a 
mammogram or for evaluation of a client with a history of breast cancer, after completing 
treatment. 
• 
KWCSP will not reimburse breast MRI when performed to assess the extent of disease in women 
who are already diagnosed with breast cancer. 
 
GENETIC COUNSELING/TESTING 
Note: The information below is adapted from the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists (ACOG)Practice Bulletin 182, September 2017. (Replaces Practice Bulletin 103, 
April 2009.) 
A woman affected by at least one of the following is at increased risk for having an inherited 
predisposition to breast and ovarian, tubal or peritoneal cancer. She should be advised of the 
need for genetic counseling and consideration of genetic testing: 
• 
Epithelial ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer 
• 
Breast cancer at age 45 years or less 
• 
Breast cancer and has a close relative* with breast cancer age 50 years or less, or 
close relative with epithelial ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer at any age 
• 
Breast cancer at age 50 years or less with a limited or unknown family history 
• 
Breast cancer and has two or more close relatives with breast cancer at any age 
• 
Breast cancer and has two or more close relatives with pancreatic cancer or 
aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason score equal to or greater than 7) 
• 
Two breast cancer primaries with the first diagnosed before age 50 years 
• 
Triple-negative breast cancer at age 60 or less 
• 
Breast cancer and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry at any age 
• 
Pancreatic cancer and have two or more close relatives with breast cancer; ovarian, 
tubal, or peritoneal cancer; pancreatic cancer; or aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason 
score equal to or greater than 7) 
A woman unaffected with cancer, but with one or more of the following has increased 
likelihood of having an inherited predisposition to breast and ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal 
cancer and should receive genetic counseling and be offered genetic testing: 
• 
A first-degree or several close relatives that meet one or more of the conditions listed 
above 
• 
A close relative carrying a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation 
• 
A close relative with male breast cancer 
*Note: “Close relative” means parent, sibling, or offspring (1st degree); grandparent, 
grandchild, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, half-sibling (2nd degree); first cousin, great- 
grandparent, or great-grandchild (3rd degree). 
LHDs are not required to refer, only to recommend genetic counseling/testing to those patients 
for whom it is indicated. KWCSP funds cannot be used for genetic counseling/testing. 
 
 
PATIENT EDUCATION ON BREAST HEALTH 
Counseling with documentation at the initial and annual visits shall include teaching breast 
self-awareness, individual breast cancer risk factors/risk reduction, benefits/risks of 
mammography and the importance of regular screenings. While the LHD staff will not 
          12
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
prescribe or refer women for risk-reducing medications, information should be provided to 
inform women of that option for some who are at increased risk for breast cancer. (An optional 
fact sheet from Komen.org can be found by clicking here , or one from the American Cancer 
Society can be found by clicking here.) 
Patients with an abnormal CBE, mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI will have documented 
counseling done, as appropriate. 
          13
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
Breast Cancer Follow-up, Post Breast Cancer Treatment 
 
 
Once a patient’s diagnostic procedures are complete and she has a diagnosis and treatment (if 
applicable), the contracted, qualified clinician (breast surgeon, radiologist, etc.) will provide an order for 
the patient’s next screening. If this is not received, the NCM must contact the contracted, qualified 
clinician to obtain an order. Even if the patient has a diagnosis with a benign finding, the clinician must 
give an order for the patient’s next screening schedule after follow-up of an abnormal screening test 
result. 
SURGICAL REFERRALS 
• 
Women with an abnormal CBE must be referred for surgical consultation once a diagnostic 
mammogram and/or diagnostic ultrasound have been completed, regardless of imaging results, 
unless CBE is done by the radiologist and found to be negative/benign. Thorough documentation 
by the radiologist shall be required. 
• 
Any patient with a bloody nipple discharge (unilateral or bilateral) requires a referral to a surgeon 
for evaluation. 
• 
Any patient with a spontaneous (without nipple stimulation) and/or unilateral nipple discharge 
requires a referral to a surgeon for evaluation. 
• 
Bilateral non-bloody discharge that occurs only with nipple stimulation does not need referral to a 
surgeon. This type of nipple discharge may be due to fibrocystic changes (usually greenish), 
hormonal imbalance, pregnancy, lactation and some medications (oral contraceptives, 
phenothiazines, anti-hypertensives, tranquilizers). If the clinician (MD or ARNP) determines the 
need for further evaluation of this type of nipple discharge, it typically is to either a gynecologist or 
endocrinologist. 
• 
If a patient presents with a “breast lump” that she has discovered herself, but both the CBE and 
mammogram (or other breast imaging) are normal, she may be referred to a surgeon for a 
second opinion. The patient may also be referred to another contracted provider for a second 
opinion for other concerns she may have regarding her care during screening. For KWCSP- 
eligible patients, the second opinion will be reimbursed by the program for services found on the 
list of KWCSP-approved CPT codes. 
• 
A patient who has a personal history of breast cancer shall be scheduled for a surgical consult 
with her annual mammogram/MRI regardless of CBE, mammogram, or MRI results. A surgical 
consult is also required for women who have completed breast cancer treatment and are in need 
of orders for surveillance. Referral visits for these situations will be reimbursed by the KWCSP 
for program-eligible women. If the provider determines that breast cancer surveillance should 
include tests/procedures not found on the KWCSP list of “Approved CPT Codes”, the NCM 
should contact the KWCSP staff for reimbursement approval. KWCSP staff can be reached at 
the Division of Women’s Health by sending an e-mail to Colleen.Toftness@ky.gov . 
• 
After an initial abnormal finding, when there is an order from a contracted qualified clinician 
(breast surgeon, radiologist, etc.) for frequent follow-up mammograms, ultrasounds, CBEs or 
surgical consults, these services will be paid for by the KWCSP until the provider has released 
the patient into normal routine screening. These follow-up services may show normal or 
abnormal findings. However, the program will reimburse the continued frequent screening 
services until the patient is released to routine screening. National standards recommend 
frequent follow-up continue for up to 2-3 years for specific original findings on radiology testing 
and clinical findings. The contracted qualified clinician (radiologist or breast surgeon) will make 
this determination.

TIMELY FOLLOW-UP 
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
 
• 
Patients with an abnormal mammogram, MRI or ultrasound result shall be notified by the health 
department within 10 working days of receiving the result, or within 30 days of the procedure, 
whichever comes first. 
• 
Referrals for a surgical consult or requests for additional imaging must be made within 3 weeks 
(21 days) of abnormal CBE or receipt of abnormal mammogram. 
• 
Copies of results from consults and diagnostic procedures (including pathology reports) will be 
received and placed in the medical record within 30 days of the consult or diagnostic procedure. 
• 
The month and year the next mammogram is due will be documented on the CH3A. A patient 
with normal screening results will follow the appropriate routine screening guidelines unless there 
is a reported change in her breasts. For patients who have been scheduled for abnormal test 
follow-up with a contracted provider, the order for the next mammogram or other future screening 
and diagnostic procedures shall be provided by the contracted qualified clinician (breast surgeon, 
radiologist, etc.) and noted in the patient chart. The NCM shall inform the patient of her next 
screening or diagnostic procedure that is ordered. 
• 
The interval between abnormal breast screening (date of screening) and final diagnosis should be 
60 days or less. 
• 
The interval between diagnosis (date of diagnosis) and initiation of treatment should also be 60 
days or less. 
 
TREATMENT FOR PRE-CANCER/CANCER OF THE BREAST 
Patients that have been screened/diagnosed through the KWCSP, or a KWCSP-designated entity 
may be eligible for the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program (BCCTP) if diagnosed with 
pre-cancer or cancer of the breast. For more information and forms related to the BCCTP, please 
refer to their website here . 
Below are some conditions that are considered precancerous conditions when found on a biopsy. If a 
patient receives one of these diagnoses or a diagnosis of cancer, she will require treatment. KWCSP- 
eligible women should apply for treatment through the BCCTP. The NCM is responsible for initiating the 
BCCTP application. 
Breast Pre-Cancerous Conditions: 
• 
Lobular carcinoma-in-situ 
• 
Atypical hyperplasia 
• 
Benign Phylloides tumors 
• 
Some types of papillomatosis 
• 
Radial scar, sometimes referred to as sclerosing lesions 
For more in-depth information on enrolling patients in treatment through the BCCTP, see the section 
“Breast/Cervical Cancer Treatment Through Medicaid’s Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program 
(BCCTP)”.

BI-RADS CLASSIFICATION OF MAMMOGRAM RESULTS AND MANAGEMENT 
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
 
 
 
Category 0: Assessment Incomplete 
This category indicates the need for additional imaging, which will be recommended by the 
radiologist or old films required for comparison. 
Category 1: Negative 
Recommendation should be made for routine follow-up according to the screening guidelines. 
Notify the patient when it is time for re-screening. 
(Refer to surgeon if CBE is abnormal) 
Category 2: Benign Finding 
Recommendation should be made for routine follow-up according to the screening guidelines. 
Notify patient when it is time for re-screening. 
(Refer to surgeon if CBE is abnormal) 
Category 3: Probably Benign 
Follow-up should be provided according to the radiologist’s recommendation. Usually, the 
radiologist will recommend a repeat mammogram in six months. Counsel the patient on the 
results of the mammogram and provide a re-screening appointment. 
(Refer to surgeon if CBE is abnormal) 
Category 4: Suspicious Abnormality 
A biopsy should be considered. Refer to a surgeon for further evaluation. Counsel the patient on 
the results of the mammogram and assure that arrangements are made for the surgical 
consultation. 
Category 5: Highly Suggestive of Malignancy 
There is probability of cancer. Refer to a surgeon for further evaluation. Counsel the patient on 
the results of the mammogram and assure that arrangements are made for the surgical 
consultation. 
Category 6: Known Biopsy-Proven Malignancy; Appropriate Action Should Be Taken 
This category is reserved for lesions identified on the imaging study with biopsy proof of 
malignancy prior to definitive therapy. 
 
 
 
 
Unsatisfactory: NOT a BI-RADS Classification. 
This result indicates that the mammogram is technically unsatisfactory and cannot be read by the 
radiologist. It must be repeated.

Cervical Cancer Screening 
 
 
Routine periodic screening encourages early identification of precancerous conditions of the cervix and 
early-stage diagnosis of cervical cancer. Most cervical cancer can be PREVENTED with detection and 
early treatment of precancerous lesions. 
CERVICAL CANCER RISK FACTORS 
This is an overall list of factors and/or behaviors which may increase the risk for cervical cancer. Some 
factors on this list are not considered when making the determination for a patient’s Pap screening 
interval. See “Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines” for factors that are used to determine when a 
patient is considered “high risk” and not eligible for increasing the time interval between screenings. 
• 
History of HPV and/or dysplasia 
• 
Multiple (3 or more) sexual partners in lifetime 
• 
A sex partner with multiple sex partners 
• 
A sex partner who has had a partner with HPV/dysplasia/cervical cancer 
• 
Cigarette smoking (any amount) 
• 
Beginning sexual intercourse at a young age (age 18 or less) 
• 
History of 2 or more sexually transmitted infections 
• 
Intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) 
• 
Infrequent screening (> 5yrs. since last screening) 
• 
Immunosuppressed (HIV/AIDS, diabetes, transplant recipient, chronic steroid use, auto-immune 
disorders) 
 
CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING HISTORY 
• 
Elicit date and result of last Pap/HPV test 
• 
Determine if a previous history of an abnormal Pap and/or HPV 
• 
Determine if history of a previous colposcopy and biopsy and/or treatment 
• 
Screen for risk factors (listed above) 
• 
Screen for history of abnormal bleeding patterns 
 
PELVIC EXAMINATION 
*Information in this section (Pelvic Examination) adapted from ACOG CommitteeOpinion Number 754, 
Oct. 2018; reaffirmed 2020) 
The pelvic examination consists of the following: 
• 
Assessment of the external genitalia 
• 
Internal speculum examination of the vagina and cervix 
• 
Bimanual palpation of the adnexa, uterus and bladder 
• 
May also include rectovaginal examination 
A screening pelvic exam is one performed as a routine screening tool on an asymptomatic, non- 
pregnant woman. In 2018 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) 
recommend that gynecologic care providers should counsel asymptomatic, non-pregnant women 
about the benefits, harms and lack of data for use of a screening pelvic exam. The patient and 
gynecologic care provider should then decide together if a pelvic examination will be performed. 
During the cancer screening visit a screening pelvic exam is not required but may be performed after 
counseling the woman about the possible benefits/harms and the lack of supporting evidence for the 
          18
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
 
screening pelvic exam, and then affirming that the woman wishes for the pelvic exam to be 
performed. 
Some possible benefits of a screening pelvic exam: 
• 
Potential for early detection of treatable gynecologic conditions 
• 
Allows an opportunity for the patient-provider conversation about normal/abnormal anatomy, 
symptoms, etc. and for the provider to answer any related questions the patient may have. 
Some possible harms of a screening pelvic exam: 
• 
Little evidence has been found as to the harms of the screening pelvic exam, such as 
fear/anxiety, pain/discomfort, or over-diagnosis, but neither is there sufficient evidence to 
support the use of a screening pelvic exam. In 2017, the USPSTF found only limited 
evidence of its ability to detect these specific gynecologic conditions: ovarian cancer, 
bacterial vaginosis, genital herpes. Studies show that pelvic examinations do not decrease 
ovarian cancer morbidity and mortality rates. 
A (diagnostic) pelvic exam should be performed when indicated by medical history or symptoms. The 
following are some (but not all) indications for performing the pelvic exam: 
• 
Abnormal bleeding 
• 
Dyspareunia 
• 
Pelvic pain 
• 
Sexual dysfunction 
• 
Vaginal dryness 
• 
Vaginal bulge 
• 
Urinary issues 
• 
Inability to insert a tampon 
RNs must refer any abnormal finding on the pelvic examination or any symptomatic woman to a mid- 
level or higher clinician or a contracted gynecologist for further evaluation. RNs may defer the pelvic 
exam on the symptomatic woman until she is seen by the higher-level clinician/gynecologist. 
Note: For pelvic exam and follow-up protocol for the STD program see the STD section of the CSG. 
 
 
CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING GUIDELINES 
For average-risk women, the LHD will follow the cervical cancer screening guidelines recommended 
by the USPSTF. 
Ages 21-29: Pap test every 3 years 
Ages 30-65: Women in this age group have 3 choices: 
1. Pap test every 3 years, 
or 
2. Primary hrHPV test every 5 years 
or 
3. Co-test (Pap and HPV) every 5 years 
Note: These guidelines are intended to guide screening of the general population. High risk women 
will follow different, more frequent screening guidelines. 
Routine cervical cancer screening begins at age 21, with the Pap test, to be repeated every 3 years. 
At age 30, a woman may choose to continue with the Pap test every 3 years or have a Primary 
hrHPV test every 5 years or have a co-test (Pap and HPV test) every 5 years. Abnormal test results 
can alter the screening schedule. Patients with a cervical history of CIN2, CIN3, or cervical cancer, in 
utero exposure to DES, or who are immunocompromised, as stated above, are considered high-risk 
patients when determining their cancer screening interval options. These women require more 
frequent screening and should be screened according to orders from the contacted gynecologist. 
Note: The physician who treats a patient’s CIN2, CIN3, or cervical cancer will determine the interval 
between future screenings and the length of screening surveillance, including possible extension of 
screening past the age of 65. 
          19
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
 
FOR ALL PATIENTS WHO ARE SENT TO A CONTRACTED GYNECOLOGIST OR 
COLPOSCOPIST: 
Once her diagnostic procedures are complete and she has a diagnosis and treatment, if applicable, 
the contracted clinician (gynecologist or colposcopist) who diagnoses and/or treats will provide an 
order for the patient’s future screening schedule. If this is not received, the NCM must contact the 
provider to obtain an order. If a patient has a history of colposcopy at another provider’s office, the 
records and order for future screening schedule should be obtained from that office. 
 
 
SPECIAL POPULATIONS 
Women with the following high-risk conditions should be screened according to orders from the 
contracted gynecologist, regardless of their age: immunosuppression (i.e., renal transplant), HIV 
infection, history of CIN2, CIN3, cervical cancer, or DES exposure in utero. If uncertain of whether a 
patient’s condition/disease would cause immunosuppression, consult your medical director or 
contracted clinician. KWCSP funds can be used for annual cervical cancer screening among women 
who are considered high-risk. 
The NCM shall contact the contracted provider to determine screening guidelines for patients with a 
history of pre-cancer or cancer of the cervix or to determine cervical cancer surveillance needs. The 
type of follow-up will often be determined by the provider according to the extent of the cancer. 
KWCSP funds can be used to reimburse for routine cervical cancer surveillance for 25 years post- 
treatment for women with a history of cervical neoplasia or in situ disease or can reimburse 
indefinitely for surveillance of women with a history of invasive cervical cancer, as long as the woman 
is in good health. If the provider determines that cervical cancer surveillance should include 
tests/procedures not found on the KWCSP list of “Approved CPT Codes”, the NCM should contact the 
KWCSP staff for reimbursement approval. KWCSP staff can be reached at the Division of Women’s 
Health by sending an e-mail to Colleen.Toftness@ky.gov . 
 
 
WOMEN FOLLOWING HYSTERECTOMY 
• 
Women at any age following a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix who do not have a 
positive history of CIN2, CIN3 or cervical cancer should not be screened for cervical cancer, 
according to current ACS-ASCCP-ACOG guidelines. 
• 
Women at any age following a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix who do have a 
positive history of CIN2, CIN3, or cervical cancer should be screened as stated in the 
preceding section (SPECIAL POPULATIONS). Vaginal/vulvar/labial Pap test or biopsies 
shall be performed by the LHD contracted clinician (gynecologist or colposcopist) for patients 
with a history of CIN2, CIN3, cervical cancer or for an abnormal physical finding during an 
exam performed at the LHD. KWCSP funds can be used to reimburse for the vaginal Pap 
tests and/or diagnostic follow-up for eligible women in this situation. 
• 
Women for whom the reason for the hysterectomy or final diagnosis of no neoplasia or 
invasive cancer cannot be documented, should continue cervical cancer screening until there 
is a 10-year history of negative screening results, including documentation that Pap test were 
technically satisfactory. 
 
VULVAR, LABIAL OR VAGINAL ABNORMALITIES 
If a vulvar or labial lesion is found during an examination, the patient shall be informed that this 
abnormal finding will need follow-up to rule out cancer. The contracted clinician (gynecologist or 
colposcopist) will perform vulvar and labial screening/diagnostic follow-up. Vulvar or labial 
procedures will not be reimbursed by the KWCSP. 
Follow-up for any abnormal finding of the vagina, vulva or labia will be determined by the gynecologist 
who performs the screening and/or diagnostic procedures for the patient. 
 
 
WOMEN OLDER THAN 65 
Women older than age 65 with documentation of adequate negative prior screening, who are not 
          20
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
 
otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer and have no history of CIN2, CIN3, or cervical cancer within 
the last 25 years should not be screened. Adequate negative prior screening is three consecutive 
negative cytology results or two consecutive negative co-tests or primary HPV tests within the 10 
years before cessation of screening, with the most recent test occurring within the past 5 years. 
WOMEN IN ABNORMAL FOLLOW-UP 
Both the 2012 ASCCP management guidelines and the interim guidance later provided for 
management of abnormal results of the Primary HPV test have been replaced with the 2019 ASCCP 
Management Consensus Guidelines for abnormal cancer screening tests and cancer precursors. 
The risk-based management (free) web application can be accessed here: 
https://app.asccp.org 
You can also purchase (for approximately $10) the mobile app here: 
https://www.asccp.org/mobile-app 
Note: It has been suggested that the mobile app is the more user-friendly option. 
When the clinical situation is such that these guidelines cannot be applied or do not provide 
guidance for the specific circumstance, or when the guidelines direct that clinical judgement 
must be used to make a decision, the RN must refer the case to a mid-level or higher clinician or 
to the contracted gynecologist to determine follow-up. 
This information should be referenced when planning case management. However, the 
contracted, qualified clinician (gynecologist, colposcopist, etc.) who provides the colposcopy 
and/or treatment will direct patient care. Services that can be reimbursed for KWCSP-eligible 
women are found on the KWCSP list of approved CPT codes. Medical providers and patients 
shall be made aware of services that can be reimbursed. Once the patient’s diagnostic 
procedures are complete and she has a diagnosis and treatment, if applicable, the contracted 
clinician who diagnoses and/or treats will provide an order for the patient’s next screening. If 
this not received, the NCM must contact this provider to obtain an order. For additional 
information/guidance, see section “MANAGEMENT OF ANBORMAL PAP/HPV TEST 
RESULTS”. 
 
 
WOMEN WHO HAVE RECEIVED THE HPV VACCINE 
Women who have received the HPV vaccine should continue to be screened according to the 
age-appropriate guidelines.

PATIENT EDUCATION ON CERVICAL HEALTH 
•
Counseling on cervical cancer risk factors, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing and
risk reduction (including smoking cessation) during screening visits is required.
Smokers must be offered referral to the Quit Now Kentucky tobacco quit line and/or
Freedom from Smoking classes.
•
Counseling on the HPV vaccination shall be provided to the patient and the parent of
minors when applicable.
•
Patients must have documented counseling, as appropriate.
FOLLOW-UP 
•
Refer patient if abnormal cervix or polyps are visualized
•
Patients with abnormal cervical cancer screening tests shall be notified within 10 working 
days from the date the abnormal test result is received at the clinic.
•
Referral appointments must be made within 3 weeks (21 days) of the clinic receiving the 
abnormal screening test result. Any delay in meeting this timeframe must be 
documented in the patient’s medical record, including any “first available” appointments
•
A final diagnosis must be made within 60 days of the cervical cancer screening.
The final diagnosis is based on colposcopy and biopsy results.
•
Treatment should be initiated 60 days or less from the date of diagnosis of a pre-cancer 
or cancer of the cervix.
•
Results of referrals including colposcopy, biopsy pathology reports, cryotherapy, Loop 
electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and pathology reports, Cold Knife Conization 
(CKC) procedure and pathology reports, and laser treatment documentation must be 
received within 30 days of the procedure
•
The month and year the next Pap/HPV test is due shall be documented on the progress 
note. The nurse’s note should include the provider's or colposcopist’s name, date, 
and source of the order (e.g., verbal order, provider's office note in chart, etc.) for the 
next screening or diagnostic procedure.
THE PRIMARY HPV TEST AND MANAGEMENT OF ABNORMAL RESULTS 
The primary hrHPV test is the newest cervical cancer screening choice for average-risk women. 
It is included as screening option in the USPSTF cervical cancer screening guidelines for 
women who are 30-65 years old (the same population who are eligible for the co-test). 
Currently two specific HPV tests have FDA approval for primary HPV screening, the Cobas HPV 
Test and the Onclarity HPV test; only the approved tests should be used for primary HPV 
screening. 
MANAGEMENT OF ABNORMAL PAP/HPV TEST RESULTS 
Follow-up for any abnormal findings of the vagina, vulva or labia will be determined by the 
contracted clinician (gynecologist or colposcopist) who performs the screening and/or diagnostic 
procedures for the patient. 
Consult the 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines (web-based or 
mobile app) for guidance in follow-up for any laboratory results for a Pap and/or HPV test. 
When the clinical situation is such that these guidelines cannot be applied or do not provide 
          24
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
 
guidance for the specific circumstance, or when the guidelines direct that clinical judgement 
must be used to make a decision, the RN must refer the case to a mid-level or higher clinician or 
to the contracted gynecologist to determine follow-up. 
 
 
CYTOLOGY RESULTS AND GUIDANCE IN ADDITION TO THE 2019 ASCCP RISK-BASED 
MANAGEMENT CONSENSUS GUIDELINES 
Below are the categories that correspond to the Bethesda 2014 System for reporting the result 
of a Pap Test. 
#1 Satisfactory/Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion 
 
#2 Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASC-US) 
 
#3 Atypical Squamous Cells Cannot Exclude High Grade Lesions (ASC-H) 
#4 Low Grade SIL (L-SIL, CIN-1, Mild Dysplasia, Including HPV Changes) 
#5 High Grade SIL (H-SIL, CIN-2, CIN-3, Moderate-Severe Dysplasia, CIS) 
#6 Squamous Cell Carcinoma 
#7 Adenocarcinoma 
 
#8 Adenocarcinoma-In-Situ (AIS) 
 
#9 Unsatisfactory

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FOR THE RN 
In addition to the guidance for management of abnormal Pap results provided by the ASCCP 
guidelines, RNs are provided this additional guidance: 
• 
Contact contracted provider if abnormal cervix or polyps visualized 
• 
If EC/TZ is absent/insufficient, consult with a higher-level clinician/provider 
• 
If presence of organisms or reactive cellular changes, consult with a higher-level 
clinician/provider 
• 
If endometrial cells or glandular cells are present: 
When there is a result of endometrial cells in a woman > 45 years of age on a negative 
Pap test result, the NCM shall contact the contracted provider. The NCM will provide all 
pertinent medical history to the physician, including past cervical history and test results, 
age and current Pap results. The physician will determine follow-up for the patient. If 
the patient is KWCSP-eligible the program will reimburse services on the approved CPT 
code list. 
• 
Consult the 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines (web-based 
or mobile app) for guidance in follow-up for any laboratory results for a Pap and/or HPV 
test. When the clinical situation is such that these guidelines cannot be applied or do 
not provide guidance for the specific circumstance, or when the guidelines direct that 
          25
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
 
clinical judgment must be used to make a decision, the RN must refer the case to a mid- 
level or higher clinician or to the contracted gynecologist to determine follow-up. 
 
 
POST COLPOSCOPY EVALUATION OR TREATMENT 
Once a patient’s diagnostic procedures are complete and she has a diagnosis and treatment, if 
applicable, the contracted qualified clinician (e.g., gynecologist, colposcopist) providing the 
colposcopy and/or treatment will provide an order for the patient’s next screening. If this is not 
received, the NCM must contact this provider to obtain an order. Even if the patient has a 
diagnosis with a benign finding, the contracted clinician who provided this diagnosis must give 
an order for the patient’s next screening schedule after follow-up of an abnormal screening test 
result. 
 
 
LOOP ELECTRICAL EXCISION PROCEDURE (LEEP), DIAGNOSTIC VS. TREATMENT 
A local surgical procedure known as LEEP, or a cone biopsy, can be considered either a 
diagnostic or a treatment procedure. 
A patient’s colposcopy biopsy may be benign, show mild dysplasia, or a biopsy may not be 
performed. However, a physician may determine that it is necessary to perform a LEEP to 
obtain a more comprehensive or accurate specimen. 
• 
When a patient’s colposcopy biopsy is benign, mild, or a biopsy was not performed a 
LEEP would be considered a diagnostic procedure and would be covered under the 
KWCSP. 
• 
When a LEEP procedure is performed on a patient who had a colposcopy diagnosis of 
HSIL the LEEP would be considered treatment and should be covered under the 
BCCTP. 
The NCM shall ensure that the patient begins the application process for the BCCTP after 
receiving the colposcopy diagnosis of cancer or pre-cancer. 
 
 
TREATMENT FOR PRE-CANCER/CANCER OF THE CERVIX 
Patients that have been screened or diagnosed through the KWCSP or a KWCSP-designated 
entity may be eligible for the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program (BCCTP) if 
diagnosed with pre-cancer/cancer of the cervix (includes endocervical). For more information 
and forms related to the BCCTP, please refer to their website by clicking here . 
Below are some conditions that are considered pre-cancerous conditions when found on a 
biopsy. If the patient receives one of these diagnoses or a diagnosis of cancer, she is eligible 
for the BCCTP: 
Cervical Pre-cancerous Conditions: 
• 
High-grade squamous epithelial lesions (HSIL) 
• 
Adenocarcinoma-in-Situ 
For more in-depth information on enrolling patients in treatment through the BCCTP, see the 
section BREAST/CERVICAL CANCER TREATMENT THROUGH MEDICAID’S BREAST AND

Breast/Cervical Cancer Treatment Through Medicaid’s 
Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program (BCCTP) 
 
 
Once a woman is screened or diagnosed through the KWCSP or a KWCSP-designated entity 
and is found to have a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of pre-cancer or cancer of the breast or 
cervix, the NCM shall begin the application process for the BCCTP. 
To be eligible for Medicaid’s BCCTP, an applicant or recipient shall be a citizen of the United 
States, or a qualified legal alien who has not yet reached the age of 65 years (See also 907 
KAR 20:005). When applying for Medicaid’s BCCTP, the LHD shall verify patient’s 
identity/citizenship (driver’s license, birth certificate, patient statement/attestation), and shall 
obtain their social security number. For more information about eligibility and/or required 
documentation, visit the BCCTP website or contact the Department for Medicaid Services at: 
1-800-635-2570. 
To begin the application process, complete the Pre-Screening Eligibility Form, MAP-813B. 
(MAP-813B cannot be completed online.) Then complete the paper application, MAP-813. A 
signed and dated copy must be saved in the patient’s chart, the information can be transferred 
to the online application, which is the one submitted to DMS. Once the online application is 
submitted, A BCCTP Confirmation page will appear. This should be printed and given to the 
client to serve as her BCCTP card. The original signed/dated paper application, Pre-Screening 
Eligibility Form, signed/dated copy of the electronic Confirmation Page, any proof of identity and 
citizenship that was provided, and social security number should all be maintained in the 
patient’s chart in the administrative section. 
As stated on the Department for Medicaid Services BCCTP website, some patients may require 
longer than the standard period of treatment and may be granted a Medicaid eligibility 
extension. An eligibility extension form (MAP-813D, Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment 
Program Extension) can be obtained from the BCCTP website. 
During the initial BCCTP application process, the NCM shall inform the patient to contact the 
NCM two week prior to the end of her Medicaid eligibility period if her treatment plan will extend 
past that eligibility period. Extension requests must be initiated by the treating physician. The 
NCM will assist the physician in obtaining an extension form to complete on the patient’s behalf. 
When extension request review is completed, recipients will receive a notice of their new 
eligibility status. 
 
 
TREATMENT PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION 
• 
A Pap test, mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI does not provide a definitive diagnosis of 
pre-cancer or cancer. These are considered screening tests. 
• 
A patient must have a biopsy that confirms either a diagnosis of cancer or pre-cancer of 
the cervix or breast for her to be eligible for the BCCTP. 
• 
Cancer or pre-cancer of the vagina, vulva, labia, or uterine/endometrial lining do not 
make a patient eligible for the BCCTP. The BCCTP is for cancer or pre-cancer 
treatment of the breast or cervix for women screened or diagnosed through the KWCSP 
or KWCSP-designated entity. 
• 
A result of HSIL on a biopsy of the cervix (CIN 2 or greater) is required for a patient to 
be considered eligible clinically for the BCCTP. 
          27
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
 
• 
Once the biopsy diagnosis is confirmed, the NCM will begin the process of ensuring that 
an application is completed for the patient to be enrolled with Medicaid (BCCTP). 
• 
The NCM is responsible for initiating the BCCTP application when a final diagnosis has 
been received and patient eligibility determined. Support staff at the LHD may assist or 
perform the application process. 
• 
The NCM should inform the patient that she should return to the LHD if treatment has 
ended, and her oncologist or other provider will no longer follow her for surveillance. 
KWCSP can reimburse for breast/cervical cancer surveillance. The appropriate 
contracted provider (e.g., surgeon, gynecologist) shall be contacted when surveillance 
orders are needed. If the provider determines that cervical cancer surveillance should 
include tests/procedures not found on the KWCSP list of approved CPT codes, the 
NCM should contact the KWCSP staff for reimbursement approval. KWCSP staff can 
be reached by sending an e-mail to: Colleen.Toftness@ky.gov . 
          28

Tracking and Follow-Up Requirements 
 
 
The local health department (LHD) is accountable for tracking KWCSP patients with abnormal 
screening test results to ensure these women receive the necessary re-screening or diagnostic 
follow-up services to reach a timely final diagnosis and begin treatment. This includes those 
patients where the screening occurred in another program such as family planning, pediatrics or 
pre-natal. Insured women with abnormal results should be referred to their primary care 
physician/medical home for necessary follow-up. Each clinic site is responsible for assigning 
this tracking responsibility to a Registered Nurse, Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner, or 
Licensed Practical Nurse. The nurse that assumes this responsibility is referred to as the Nurse 
Case Manager (NCM). 
Prior to assuming the role and responsibilities of NCM with the KWCSP, the nurse must 
complete the following educational modules on TRAIN: 
• 
Utilizing Kentucky’s Women’s Cancer Screening and Treatment Programs 
(Course # 1095818) 
• 
Utilizing Kentucky’s Clinical Service Guide: Women’s Cancer Screening 
(Course # 1095816) 
• 
Nurse Case Management for Women’s Cancer Screening Abnormal Results 
(Course # 1095819) 
• 
Follow-up Documentation for Women’s Cancer Screening Abnormal Results 
(Course # 1095817) 
 
 
TRAINING IN ADDITION TO MODULES FOR NEW NURSE CASE MANAGERS 
When there is a staff change for the NCM position, the Nursing or Clinical Supervisor must 
notify the Clinical Coordinator of the KWCSP as soon as possible by sending an e-mail to 
Colleen.Toftness@ky.gov (preferred) or KWCSP@ky.gov . One-on-one training will be 
provided to each new NCM by a KWCSP Nurse Consultant. This training may be provided by 
webcast, telephonically, or in person. 
 
 
BACKUP NURSE CASE MANAGERS 
There must also be another RN, LPN, or APRN, a back-up NCM who is knowledgeable about 
cancer screening follow-up and who is available to assume the NCM’s role and responsibilities 
in the event the NCM is absent for more than 7 calendar days. A timely diagnosis is crucial to 
creating positive outcomes in cancer screening. Completion of the modules listed above are 
also required of the backup NCM prior to assuming NCM duties; the one-on-one training is 
optional. 
 
 
NURSE CASE MANAGER DUTIES 
Tracking and follow-up can be time consuming and therefore it is recommended that 
professional and support staff work as a team toward this effort. The NCM is required to provide 
patient contact, counseling, tracking and follow-up, while the support staff may assist the NCM 
by scheduling appointments, obtaining records, and electronic entry of data. The NCM shall 
          29
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
review all patient appointment arrangements and medical records to provide detailed 
documentation of the Progress Notes of the patient’s medical chart. Administrative time is 
imperative NCMs to meet program requirements. The NCM should assure that all aspects of 
the case management process are appropriately documented in the patient’s service record. 
The NCM must have an organized manual or electronic tracking system in place to assure that 
patients receive appropriate and timely intervention. It is also strongly recommended that the 
Case Management Form side of the WH-58 be used to assist staff with this required tracking 
and follow-up. 
It is the responsibility of the KWCSP NCM to contact the patient, surgeon, or oncologist to 
ensure the patient has begun treatment for a cancer or pre-cancerous condition. The patient 
must have had a service that either removed all of part of her cancer or received chemotherapy 
or radiation to reduce her cancer for her treatment to be considered started. The NCM does not 
continue to provide case management for treatment, once a patient is in the treatment program 
(BCCTP). The patient’s care will be managed by her Kentucky Medicaid health care providers. 
The NCM does not need to request treatment records. However, the NCM must document on 
the CH-3 nursing notes, the type of treatment that began the patient’s care and the date that it 
was performed. The NCM shall document the source of this information (provider's name and 
specialty, patient, etc.). 
For further testing and management after the initial abnormal result, patients who qualify for 
KWCSP should be case managed by the LHD according to program guidelines. However, 
when a patient has a medical home, the patient may be referred to the primary care physician 
for follow-up management, after the patient is informed of the abnormal test result and need for 
follow-up. 
LHDs should have good communication with local medical home providers so that 
each provider’s role and expectations are clear. 
A flowchart outlining the case management guidelines can be found at the end of the Cancer 
Screening/Follow-up section. 
INFORMING THE PATIENT OF ABNORMAL RESULTS 
Patients with an abnormal Pap test or mammogram result must be notified within 10 working 
days from receipt of the abnormal test result or within 30 days from the test date (whichever 
comes first) following this plan of action: 
1.
Whenever possible, the NCM shall contact the patient by telephone and have her come
to the clinic for face-to-face counseling for abnormal test results. It is expected that the
clinic has emergency numbers for all “no home contact” patients. Guidance for “no
home contact” patients and minors is found in KRS 214.185.
2.
When the patient comes into the LHD for counseling, test results and recommendations
for follow-up are reviewed with the patient, options discussed and a letter explaining the
result in writing is given to the patient. Arrangements for follow-up are then made (see
next section, “FOLLOW-UP FOR ABNORMAL TEST RESULTS”).
3.
If the NCM is unable to make verbal contact with the patient by phone, then an attempt
to contact the patient by letter, on the same day as the unsuccessful phone call, is
necessary. The letter shall inform the patient about the abnormal test result with
instructions to contact the NCM at the LHD.
4.
If the patient does not respond within 10 working days after the letter is mailed, the
nurse shall then send a certified letter to the patient informing her of her abnormal test
results with instructions to contact the LHD.
          30
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
 
Once the above has been completed with no response then it is appropriate to 
document the patient as lost to follow-up. 
 
 
FOLLOW-UP FOR ABNORMAL TEST RESULTS 
All patients with abnormal lab tests need follow-up. Patients who meet eligibility criteria for 
KWCSP must be referred according to program guidelines to contracted specialists for further 
testing/evaluation. Other patients may have a medical home (regular source of medical care) 
outside of the LHD. The patient’s medical home/PCP can be determined at registration. 
Medical homes may include private physicians, Primary Care Centers, FQHCs and Community 
Health Centers. These providers will be responsible for arranging and providing follow-up care 
for their patients. Each local health department should maintain open communication with 
primary care providers in their area to be sure there is agreement on roles and expectations for 
follow-up of patients with abnormal results. 
 
 
FOLLOW-UP ARRANGEMENTS FOR KWCSP-ELIGIBLE PATIENTS 
1. The NCM will schedule an appointment for the patient with a KWCSP contracted 
provider for the appropriate follow-up testing or evaluation. A referral letter and reports 
of the abnormal test results are sent to the contracted provider who will be seeing the 
patient. 
2. The NCM tracks to see that the patient showed for the appointment and documents the 
visit in the patient’s chart. 
3. The NCM collects reports from the contracted provider and makes arrangements for 
further diagnostic testing as ordered. 
4. If the patient does not keep an appointment for a scheduled consult appointment, 
diagnostic procedure, treatment, or follow-up/ repeat Pap, a certified letter will be sent to 
the patient within 10 working days of the missed appointment. No further follow-up 
tracking is needed for these patients. If the patient reschedules a missed appointment 
after receiving a certified letter and then does not keep that appointment, a second 
certified letter is not necessary. 
5. All attempts of patient contact shall be documented in the progress notes (CH3A) 
6. If the patient is a minor with a potentially life-threatening test result (includes a “HSIL” or 
“ASC-H” result on a Pap test or “Suspicious Abnormality” or “Highly Suggestive of 
Malignancy” mammogram (or other breast imaging) and cannot be contacted, the 
parent or guardian must be contacted. Minors shall be made aware of this policy at the 
screening visit. 
 
 
FOLLOW-UP ARRANGEMENTS FOR PATIENTS WITH A MEDICAL HOME 
1. The NCM will schedule an appointment for the patient with their Primary Care Provider 
(PCP) for the appropriate follow-up testing or evaluation. A referral letter and reports of 
the abnormal test results along with past pertinent abnormal cervical cancer 
screening/diagnostic tests and results are sent to the PCP who will be seeing the 
patient. Document in the progress notes (CH3A) all transfer of care actions provided for 
the patient. 
          31
Cancer Screening 
July 2023 
 
 
Note: It is imperative that the PCP is informed of any of their patient’s abnormal test 
results. This will allow the PCP to assure that the patient receives the appropriate 
follow-up care. 
2. If the patient is a minor with a potentially life-threatening test result (includes a “HSIL” or 
“ASC-H” result on a Pap test or a “Suspicious Abnormality” or “Highly Suggestive of 
Malignancy” mammogram (or other breast imaging) and cannot be contacted, the 
parent or guardian must be contacted. Minors shall be made aware of this policy at the 
screening visit. 
3. All attempts of contact with the patient and the PCP shall be documented in the 
patient’s progress notes (CH3A). 
 
 
OTHER SITUATIONS 
Patients who are not KWCSP-eligible and do not have a medical home: LHDs may screen 
some patients who are not eligible for KWCSP and do not have a medical home. Efforts should 
be made to find the patient a medical home. If that is not possible, then the LHD may manage 
these patients following KWCSP protocols and providers. Efforts should be made to find other 
resources for financial assistance in these circumstances as they would not be covered by the 
KWCSP. 
Work-up Refused: This occurs when a patient has been notified and counseled (by phone or in 
person) regarding an abnormal result and either fails to deep a referral appointment for 
diagnostics/treatment or verbalizes her desire not to seek follow-up. The date of final contact 
should be noted in the service record (CH3A) and on the data collection form side of the WH-58. 
Lost to Follow-up: This occurs when unable to inform and counsel the patient, either by phone 
or in person, regarding an abnormal test result. The date of the final contact attempt should be 
noted in the service record (CH3A) and on the data collection form side of the WH-58. 
          32

Accepting Referrals/ Follow-up Referral Requirements 
 
 
Healthcare providers should be encouraged to refer uninsured women to the LHD as soon as 
possible to determine eligibility for the KWCSP. In the event a KWCSP-eligible woman presents 
to the LHD for cancer-screening services, but has had a physical examination within the past 12 
months that include CBE, pelvic exam and Pap test from another healthcare provider, the 
following are requirements of the KWCSP: 
• 
The woman must meet the eligibility requirements of the program and provide consent 
for services. 
• 
The patient is responsible for bringing her records at the time of the visit or having them 
sent to the LHD prior to the visit. This will enable the LHD provider to assess if all the 
minimum requirements were met. These records of the Pap test result as will as any 
other pertinent laboratory work, such as stool for occult blood, hemoglobin, blood sugar, 
and cholesterol results. (A note from a physician such as “normal CBE, needs 
mammogram” is not acceptable for medical record documentation). 
• 
The comprehensive health history form must be completed and reviewed with the 
patient. The height, weight, BMI and blood pressure should be obtained and recorded. 
• 
If the physical examination portion of the visit was completed elsewhere (within the past 
12 months) the nurse or clinician shall document on the physical exam form “See 
incoming records for the physical examination.” 
• 
If the provider has failed to provide documentation of any of the minimal requirements 
on the patient, the LHD is responsible for completing these components prior to referral 
for screening or diagnostic services. 
• 
It is the responsibility of the LHD to educate providers as to the minimal referral 
requirements of the program in order to accept patients for screening and possibly 
follow-up diagnostic services.

CHECKING OXYGEN CYLINDERS 
1. Identify which cylinder you have (Figure A or B below) and determine which directions you need to 
follow. Direction/step numbers pertain to numbers on the figures below. 
2. Check to be certain regulator is hand-tight on neck of cylinder (Figure A only). 
3. Adjust flowmeter dial to “0”. (If equipped with flowmeter dial.) 
4. Open oxygen cylinder by turning toggle or key to the left (Figure A only). Figure B cylinder does not 
need to be opened. 
5. Note the position of the indicator on the regulator dial. Just above or in the red area on the dial 
indicates the cylinder should be refilled. 500 psi or greater indicates sufficient oxygen for at least 
one patient use. 
6. Record psi indication with date on a maintenance checklist (if available). 
7. Close oxygen cylinder by turning toggle or key to the right (Figure A only). 
8. Bleed pressure out of the regulator by turning the flowmeter dial to its highest possible setting 
(Figure A only). 
9. Once the sound of pressure releasing is no longer heard, turn the flowmeter dial to “0” (Figure A 
only). 
Important Notes re: O2 cylinders: 
• 
Oxygen cylinders should never be stored with pressure in the regulator or with the flowmeter set at 
any other value than “0”. If stored with pressure in the regulator, the integrity of the system may be 
compromised, and the tank could leak. A flowmeter storage value of other than “0” will also cause 
leakage. 
• 
Connections to oxygen delivery devices should also be checked monthly. 
• 
Always turn your oxygen cylinder on, check for adequate volume and properly prepare your 
delivery device before delivering oxygen to the patient!! 
 
Oxygen Cylinder Markings 
 
Oxygen cylinders are marked to designate the type of cylinder, maximum fill pressure, hydrostatic test 
date, inspector, manufacturer, and serial number. The marking is normally stamped into the shoulder of 
the cylinder. The hydrostatic test date and inspector mark indicate when the cylinder was last tested and 
who tested the cylinder. Most oxygen cylinders are required to be tested every 5 years. This test ensures 
the cylinder can safety hold the maximum fill pressure. There are two other markings which are 
sometimes found on these cylinders. The plus (+) sign located after the test date designates that the 
cylinder can be filled to 10% above the pressure stamped on the cylinder. The five-pointed star in the 
          38
Emergencies 
JULY 2023 
 
 
same location designates that the hydrostatic test date has been extended an additional 5 years. A 
cylinder with a five-pointed star would need to be tested every 10 years.

Example Commercial Oxygen Cylinder Label 
 
CGA Pamphlet C-9, Standard Color Marking of Compressed Gas Cylinders Intended for 
Medical Use states the color for oxygen cylinders is green. No other gas should be placed in a 
cylinder designated for oxygen. It is a safe practice to validate the contents of cylinders with an 
oxygen analyzer before use. This will validate both content and concentration. Most cylinders 
filled by commercial sources will also have a label indicating the contents and an oxidizer or fire 
warning. These labels should not be removed or covered by other labels or markings.

Naloxone (Intramuscular/subcutaneous)* 
 
Indications 
 
Naloxone is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid 
overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. 
• 
Naloxone is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where 
opioids may be present. 
• 
Naloxone is not a substitute for emergency medical care. When in doubt, if an individual is 
unresponsive and an opioid overdose is suspected, administer naloxone as quickly as possible 
because prolonged respiratory depression may result in damage to the central nervous system or 
death but do not delay life-saving interventions. 
• 
Call 911 to activate EMS immediately after administering the first dose of naloxone. 
 
Signs and Symptoms of Opioid Overdose 
All LHD nurses should be trained on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose 
requiring the use of naloxone. Symptoms may include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Extreme sleepiness (inability to awaken verbally or upon tactile stimulation) 
• 
Slow to shallow respirations in drowsy or a patient that cannot be awakened 
• 
Snoring or gurgling sounds (due to partial upper airway obstruction) 
• 
Cyanosis of the lips/fingernails 
• 
Extremely small “pinpoint” pupils 
• 
Slow heart rate and/or low blood pressure 
 
Signs of Overmedication (may progress to overdose) 
• 
Unusual sleepiness 
• 
Drowsiness or difficulty staying awake with loud verbal stimulus or tactile stimulation 
• 
Mental confusion 
• 
Slurred speech 
• 
Intoxicated behavior 
• 
Slow or shallow respirations 
• 
Extremely small “pinpoint” pupils, although normal size pupils DO NOT exclude opioid overdose 
• 
Slow heart rate 
• 
Low blood pressure 
 
It is important to note that not all signs and symptoms may be present during an opioid overdose. If the 
individual is not responsive to aggressive verbal and tactile stimulation-ACT PROMPTLY! 
• 
CALL OUT FOR HELP 
• 
CHECK FOR BREATHING 
• 
CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY 
• 
GET THE NALOXONE 
 
Dosage and Intramuscular Administration: 
• 
Naloxone Intramuscular Injection 0.4mg/1mL single dose vial: 
2 single dose vials and 2 syringes (3 mL syringe with 23- or 25-gauge 1-inch needles) 
• 
Naloxone Intramuscular Injection 1 mg/mL, 2 mL single dose disposable Luer-Jet™ Luer- 
Lock Prefilled Syringe 
Adult (> 17 years) Naloxone HCL 0.4mg/1mL-2 mg IM/SQ. May repeat every 3 minutes until desired 
response, breathing returns or EMS arrives. If no response is observed after 10 mg of naloxone 
hydrocholoride have been administered, question opioid toxicity.

JULY 2023 
 
 
Child/Adolescent (5-17 years; > 20 kg) 0.01mg/kg/dose IM/SQ. May repeat every 3 minutes until desired 
response, breathing returns, or EMS arrives. 
Infants and Children (< 5 years; < 20 kg) 0.1 mg/kg/dose IM/SQ; may require repeated doses to prevent 
recurrent apnea. FDA-approved labeling recommends 0.01 mg/kg/dose IM, or subcutaneously every 2 to 
3 minutes until the desired response is obtained, breathing returns, or EMS arrives. 
 
Preparing naloxone in a vial: 
1. Remove cap from the vial (do not touch the rubber stopper on the top of the vial). 
2. Remove the cap from the syringe (be careful not to touch the needle). 
3. Insert the needle into the vial and turn the vial upside down. 
4. Pull the entire contents of the vial into the syringe. 
5. Take the syringe out of the vial (carefully – do not touch the needle). Attempt to remove all of the 
large air bubbles from the syringe. 
6. Wipe chosen injection site with alcohol swab prior to needle insertion. 
7. Syringe should be inserted at a 90-degree angle. 
8. Inject the contents of the syringe into the upper arm or thigh. 
9. Carefully pull needle from the site. Some syringes have a safety covering that can shield the 
needle to prevent an accidental needle stick. 
10. Never recap the needle. 
11. Dispose of used syringe properly (sharps container or hard plastic container). 
a. Other option for disposal – give used syringe and vial to EMS when they arrive. 
12. May repeat every 3 minutes until breathing returns or EMS arrives. When person begins to 
breathe, wake up, or vomit, place person on his/her side in the recovery position. Make sure to 
put space between you and the individual to protect yourself. 
 
Preparing naloxone in pre-filled syringe: 
1. Open the box and pull out the pre-filled 1mL syringe 
2. Attach the 1-1 ½ inch needle to the syringe 
3. Remove the safety cap on the needle 
4. Quickly push the needle straight down into the outer mid-thigh muscle, through the clothes if 
necessary 
5. Inject the contents of the syringe into the muscle 
6. Carefully pull needle from the site. Some syringes have a safety covering that can shield the 
needle to prevent an accidental needle stick. 
7. Never recap the needle. 
8. Dispose of used syringe properly (sharps container or hard plastic container). 
9. Other option for disposal – give used syringe and vial to EMS when they arrive. 
10. May repeat every 3 minutes until breathing returns or EMS arrives. When person begins to 
breathe, wake up, or vomit, place person on his/her side in the recovery position. Make sure to 
put space between you and the individual to protect yourself. 
 
ASSURE 911 HAS BEEN CALLED and that EMS has been activated. 
STAY WITH THE PERSON AND MONITOR AND INTERVENE FOR RESPIRATORY DISTRESS. 
Provide rescue breathing as necessary if there is no breathing or breathing continues to be shallow, 
lay the person on their back and continue to perform rescue breathing while waiting for the naloxone 
to take effect, the person breathes for themselves, or EMS arrives. If they are breathing on their own, 
place them in the recovery position, on their side and support the body with one bent knee with the 
face turned to the side. 
REPEAT NALOXONE ADMINISTRATION IF SYMPTOMS CONTINUE. The duration of action of 
most opioids is likely to exceed the 30-90 minutes that naloxone will be effective, resulting in a return 
of respiratory and/or central nervous system depression, even after an initial improvement in 
          48

symptoms. If the desired response is not obtained after 2 or 3 minutes, another dose of naloxone may 
be administered if available. 
 
Contraindications 
Naloxone HCL is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to naloxone hydrochloride or 
to any of the other ingredients. 
 
Warnings and Precautions 
• 
Due to the duration of action, keep the patient under continued surveillance and repeated doses 
of naloxone should be administered, as necessary, while awaiting emergency medical 
assistance. 
• 
Other supportive and/or resuscitative measures may be helpful while awaiting emergency 
medical assistance. 
• 
Reversal of respiratory depression by partial agonists or mixed agonists/antagonists such as 
buprenorphine and pentazocine, may be incomplete. 
• 
Use in patients who are opioid dependent may precipitate acute abstinence syndrome. 
• 
Patients with pre-existing cardiac disease or patients who have received medications with 
potential adverse cardiovascular effects should be monitored in an appropriate healthcare setting 
• 
In neonates, opioid withdrawal may be life-threatening if not recognized and properly treated. 
 
Adverse Reactions 
• 
The following adverse reactions have been identified during use of naloxone hydrochloride in the 
post-operative setting: Hypotension, hypertension, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, 
dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest. Death, coma, and encephalopathy have been 
reported as sequelae of these events. 
• 
Excessive doses of naloxone hydrochloride in post-operative patients have resulted in significant 
reversal of analgesia and have caused agitation. 
• 
Abrupt reversal of opioid effects in persons who were physically dependent on opioids has 
precipitated signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal including: body aches, fever, sweating, 
runny nose, sneezing, piloerection, yawning, weakness, shivering or trembling, nervousness, 
restlessness or irritability, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, abdominal cramps, increased blood 
pressure, tachycardia. 
• 
In the neonate, opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms also included: convulsions, excessive 
crying, hyperactive reflexes. 
 
Storage and Handling 
• 
Store naloxone at controlled room temperature 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F) and in a dark area. 
• 
The naloxone should be checked monthly to ensure proper storage, expiration date, and 
medication stability. Expired naloxone or those with discolored solution or solid particles should 
not be used. Discard them in a sharp’s container. 
• 
Local health department clinical staff should be familiar with the type of naloxone maintained by 
their agency and its use. 
• 
Local health department clinical staff should refer to the package insert for the naloxone used in 
their facility and store naloxone hydrochloride according to the individual manufacturer’s direction 
 
*Place a copy of this protocol on the crash cart, emergency tray with the Emergency Equipment, Supplies

Naloxone (Intranasal)* 
 
Indications 
 
Naloxone is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid 
overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. 
• 
Naloxone is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where 
opioids may be present. 
• 
Naloxone is not a substitute for emergency medical care. When in doubt, if an individual is 
unresponsive and an opioid overdose is suspected, administer naloxone as quickly as possible 
because prolonged respiratory depression may result in damage to the central nervous system or 
death but do not delay life-saving interventions. 
• 
Call 911 to activate EMS immediately after administering the first dose of naloxone. 
 
Signs and Symptoms of Opioid Overdose 
All LHD nurses should be trained on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose 
requiring the use of naloxone. Symptoms may include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Extreme sleepiness (inability to awaken verbally or upon tactile stimulation) 
• 
Slow to shallow respirations in drowsy or a patient that cannot be awakened 
• 
Snoring or gurgling sounds (due to partial upper airway obstruction) 
• 
Cyanosis of the lips/fingernails 
• 
Extremely small “pinpoint” pupils 
• 
Slow heart rate and/or low blood pressure 
 
Signs of Overmedication (may progress to overdose) 
• 
Unusual sleepiness 
• 
Drowsiness or difficulty staying awake with loud verbal stimulus or tactile stimulation 
• 
Mental confusion 
• 
Slurred speech 
• 
Intoxicated behavior 
• 
Slow or shallow respirations 
• 
Extremely small “pinpoint” pupils, although normal size pupils DO NOT exclude opioid overdose 
• 
Slow heart rate 
• 
Low blood pressure 
 
It is important to note that not all signs and symptoms may be present during an opioid overdose. If the 
individual is not responsive to aggressive verbal and tactile stimulation-ACT PROMPTLY!

CALL OUT FOR HELP 
• 
CHECK FOR BREATHING

ASSURE 911 HAS BEEN CALLED and that EMS has been activated. 
STAY WITH THE PERSON AND MONITOR AND INTERVENE FOR RESPIRATORY DISTRESS. 
Provide rescue breathing as necessary if there is no breathing or breathing continues to be shallow, lay 
the person on their back and continue to perform rescue breathing while waiting for the naloxone to take 
effect, the person breathes for themselves, or EMS arrives. If they are breathing on their own, place them 
in the recovery position, on their side and support the body with one bent knee with the face turned to the 
side. 
REPEAT NALOXONE ADMINISTRATION IF SYMPTOMS CONTINUE. The duration of action of most 
opioids is likely to exceed the 30-90 minutes that naloxone will be effective, resulting in a return of 
respiratory and/or central nervous system depression, even after an initial improvement in symptoms. If 
the desired response is not obtained after 2 or 3 minutes, another dose of naloxone may be administered 
if available. 
 
Contraindications 
NARCAN is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to naloxone hydrochloride or to 
any of the other ingredients. 
 
Warnings and Precautions 
• 
Due to the duration of action, keep the patient under continued surveillance and repeated doses 
of naloxone should be administered, as necessary, while awaiting emergency medical 
assistance. 
• 
Other supportive and/or resuscitative measures may be helpful while awaiting emergency 
medical assistance. 
• 
Reversal of respiratory depression by partial agonists or mixed agonists/antagonists such as 
buprenorphine and pentazocine, may be incomplete. 
• 
Use in patients who are opioid dependent may precipitate acute abstinence syndrome. 
• 
Patients with pre-existing cardiac disease or patients who have received medications with 
potential adverse cardiovascular effects should be monitored in an appropriate healthcare setting 
• 
In neonates, opioid withdrawal may be life-threatening if not recognized and properly treated. 
 
Adverse Reactions 
The following adverse reactions were observed in a NARCAN Nasal Spray clinical study: increased blood 
pressure, musculoskeletal pain, headache, nasal dryness, nasal edema, nasal congestion, and nasal 
inflammation. 
          56

JULY 2023 
 
 
Storage and Handling 
• 
Store naloxone at controlled room temperature 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F) and in a dark area. 
• 
The naloxone should be checked monthly to ensure proper storage, expiration date, and 
medication stability. Expired naloxone or those with discolored solution or solid particles should 
not be used. Discard them in a sharp’s container. 
• 
Local health department clinical staff should be familiar with the type of naloxone maintained by 
their agency and its use. 
• 
Local health department clinical staff should refer to the package insert for the naloxone used in 
their facility and store naloxone hydrochloride according to the individual manufacturer’s direction 
 
*Place a copy of this protocol on the crash cart, emergency tray with the Emergency Equipment, Supplies 
and Medications Inventory List and the Treatment of Anaphylactic Shock Protocol. Modified naloxone 
protocols may be developed locally for products not covered in this protocol.

CONTRACEPTIVES 
Educate client of the types of contraceptives available, so client can be informed to choose which method 
of contraception will work best for them. Inability to pay should not serve as a barrier to access to 
contraceptive or other family planning services. Client’s choice of contraceptive must be voluntary and 
without coercion. The Kentucky Family Planning Guide, also known as FPEM-19, may be utilized as an 
overview of each type of contraceptive; and may assist client to determine which contraceptive method 
is best for him/her. 
Effectiveness of any contraceptive is optimal with consistent use according to manufacturer 
recommendations. See CDC chart to compare effectiveness of family planning methods. 
Manufacturer recommendations located on package inserts of specific products are the best sources for 
the following information: indications and usage, dosage and administration, contraindications, warnings, 
and precautions, adverse reactions, drug interactions, use in specific populations such as pregnancy, 
postpartum, breastfeeding, pediatric, storage and handling, and specific patient counseling information. 
Package insert for specific manufacturer recommendations are also best to screen for 
contraindications of specific methods based on client condition, client and family medical history, and 
known risk factors. 
The CDC Summary Chart of U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use is also available as a 
quick reference to determine contraindications. The following categories on the summary chart help 
determine the safety for a client. See below for the definition of the different categories utilized in the 
summary chart: 
•
Category 1: No restriction for the use of contraceptive method
•
Category 2: Advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks
•
*Category 3: The theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using the method
•
*Category 4: Represents an unacceptable health risk if the contraceptive method is used
*Do not initiate family planning method in Categories 3 or 4 by use of standing orders. A consultation with a provider should
occur prior to initiation of Categories 3 or 4.
For patient safety, teachings should be client centered and performed for the specific product used for 
contraception. Information for counseling for specific products is located on the package insert.

NATURAL FERTILITY AWARENESS 
Family planning providers and staff can use the RHNTC job aid to explain fertility indicators and 
fertility awareness-based methods (FABMs) to clients. FABMs are methods for avoiding 
unintended pregnancy or achieving intended pregnancy that require clients to monitor their 
fertility indicators. 
STERILIZATION 
 
Sterilization of persons in federally assisted family planning projects must meet the requirements of Title 
42 Chapter 1 Subchapter D Part 50 Subpart B 50.201 through 50.209 of the Public Health Service Act. 
Federally required consent forms: 
English: https://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-07/consent-for-sterilization-english-2025.pdf 
Spanish: https://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-07/consent-for-sterilization-spanish-2025.pdf 
Programs or projects to which this subpart applies shall perform or arrange for sterilization procedure of 
an individual if all requirements have been met. Requirements are that individual must be: mentally 
competent, at least 21 years of age at the time consent is obtained, has voluntarily given his/her informed 
consent, AND 
• 
At least 30 days but not more than 180 days have passed between the date of informed consent 
(day one begins the day after consent) and the date of the sterilization procedure, except in the 
case of premature delivery or emergency abdominal surgery. An individual may consent to be 
sterilized at the time of a premature delivery or emergency abdominal surgery, if at least 72 hours 
have passed after the individual gave informed consent to the sterilization. In the case of 
premature delivery, the informed consent must have been given at least 30 days before the 
expected date of delivery. Consent must not be obtained when the patient is: 
o 
In labor or childbirth, or 
o 
Seeking to obtain or obtaining an abortion, or 
o 
Under the influence of alcohol or other substances that affect the individual’s state of 
awareness 
 
Informed consent does not exist unless the federally required consent form for men or women is 
completed voluntarily and in accordance with Federal Regulations. A person who obtains informed 
          66
Family Planning 
July 2023 
 
 
consent for a sterilization procedure must offer to answer any questions the individual to be sterilized may 
have regarding the procedure. Provide a copy of the consent form and tell the patient the following: 
• 
Advise that the individual is free to withhold or withdraw consent to the procedure at any time 
without affecting his/her right to future care or treatment and without loss or withdrawal of any 
federally funded program benefits 
• 
A description of available alternative methods of family planning and birth control 
• 
Advise that the procedure is considered irreversible 
• 
A thorough explanation of the specific procedure to be performed 
• 
A full description of the discomforts and risks that may accompany or follow the procedure; 
including an explanation of the type and possible side effects of any anesthetic used; and 
• 
A full description of the benefits/advantages of sterilization. 
• 
Advise that the sterilization will be performed for at least 30 days except under the circumstances 
above. 
Sterilizations paid for with funds earmarked for family planning services must first be made available to 
patients without another source of payment, and reported on the Kentucky Family Planning Sterilization 
Record. Consent of spouse is NOT required for sterilization. 
An interpreter must be provided to assist the individual to be sterilized if he or she does not understand 
the language used on the consent form or the language used by the person obtaining the consent. 
Patients who have had a sterilization either provided or “arranged for” must have a medical record on file 
showing the date of counseling and consent, the date of the procedure, and any indicated follow-up. The 
individual patient’s medical record must contain a copy of the completed consent form and the operative 
report from the physician performing the procedure. 
The following definitions are found in the Public Health Services Act, Subpart B – sterilization of persons 
in Federally Assisted Family Planning Projects – 50.202. 
“Arranged for” means to make arrangements (other than mere referral of an individual to, or the mere 
making of an appointment for him or her with another healthcare provider) for the performance of a 
medical procedure on an individual by a healthcare provider other than the program or project. 
“Mentally incompetent individual” means an individual who has been declared mentally incompetent by a 
Federal, State, or local court of competent jurisdiction for any purpose unless he or she has been 
declared competent for purposes, which include the ability to consent to sterilization. 
PRECONCEPTION HEALTHCARE 
Educate clients about the importance of pregnancy planning and spacing to reduce adverse pregnancy 
outcomes. A reproductive life plan (RLP) may reduce unintended pregnancy. RLP is a set of personal 
goals regarding if, when, and how to have children based on individual priorities, resources, and values. 
Take advantage of each family planning visit to assess each client’s short and long-term reproductive 
plans. Reproductive Health National Training Center has a Preconception Counseling Checklist which 
includes guidance per ACOG recommendations. 
Preconception interventions may include the following: 
• 
Discuss reproductive life plan, readiness, and desire for pregnancy 
• 
Evaluate overall health and opportunities to improve health 
• 
Refer for clinical breast exam and/or PAP screening per KWCSP recommendations 
• 
Explain that a healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce gestational diabetes 
• 
Studies show that taking folic acid (0.4 mg of folic acid per day) before getting pregnant and for 3 
months after conception can reduce the risk of neural tube disorders, such as spina bifida by up 
to 70% 
          67
Family Planning 
July 2023 
 
 
• 
Immunizations – assess need for boosters or other immunization needs such as rubella, tetanus, 
chicken pox, HBV, HPV if applicable 
• 
Control chronic and acute medical health conditions, such as diabetes, HTN, infections, asthma, 
or seizure disorders. Control of medical conditions before and during pregnancy reduces the risk 
of miscarriage and stillbirths, and other health problems for the infant 
• 
Review prescriptions for teratogenic medications 
• 
Screen for infectious disease as applicable 
• 
Educate client to avoid use of alcohol, nicotine, and drug use. During pregnancy, these behaviors 
can increase risk for SIDS, preterm birth, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and neural tube 
disorders 
• 
Strive to reach a healthy weight before pregnancy. Obesity can make it more difficult to become 
pregnant, and may result in additional complications during pregnancy, such as HTN, 
preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, stillbirth, and increase risk of cesarean delivery 
• 
Assess a family history for intellectual disabilities, or genetic disorders such as sickle cell anemia, 
cystic fibrosis, or neural tube defects 
• 
Discuss any issues with anxiety, depression, domestic violence, history of PTSD, financial issues, 
and support issues (including readiness for parenthood) 
Assessment and counseling should be provided only by a qualified provider who has training in risk 
identification with the ability to provide appropriate counseling and referrals of pregnancy related risk 
factors to include: 
• 
Advanced maternal age (pregnancy at or over the age of 35) poses a higher risk of chromosomal 
abnormalities in the fetus and medical problems to the mother during pregnancy 
• 
Ethnic concerns – positive family history of diseases may indicate need for additional screening 
• 
STDs––early treatment decreases the risk of transmission to the fetus, and preterm delivery 
• 
Vaccination history (Refer to Immunizations Section) 
• 
Chronic medical conditions such as, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, epilepsy, DVT, depression 
• 
Screen for alcohol, tobacco, other drugs (ATOD) 
• 
Domestic violence 
•

Follow-up Measures to Ensure Continuity of Care 
 
 
Appropriate follow-up measures should be taken to ensure continuity of care for: 
• 
Patients who have abnormal test results 
• 
Patients who have been referred to other providers 
• 
Patients who have missed return appointments 
• 
Patients who transfer to the LHD from another health care provider must be screened by the LHD 
protocols and minimal standards of care must be met as outlined. (The LHD may accept 
documented normal results of screening tests done within the periodicity according to the specific 
program guidelines). 
• 
Patients who are pregnant and request services other than prenatal care must be asked if they 
have a designated prenatal care provider and if prenatal care has been initiated. This information 
must be documented in the medical record. If the patient does not have a designated prenatal 
care provider, the health department staff must assist the patient in accessing prenatal care. 
These efforts must also be documented in the medical record. 
 
 
Documentation of all return appointments and contacts made or attempted must be in the patient’s 
medical records. “No Show” should be documented in the medical record when a patient is 
noncompliant in keeping appointments. 
This documentation should include: 
• 
The reason for the call 
• 
Any problems discussed by the patient/provider 
• 
Any action taken and advice or instructions given 
• 
The date and time of the call 
The specific time frames utilized when providing follow-up will be determined by the professional who 
initiated the referral, unless further defined by federal or state guidelines or services protocols, and as 
indicated by the urgency of the situation. (Specific guidelines for abnormal laboratory/radiology follow-up 
are at the end of this sections). 
          70
Follow-up/Internal Tracking/Referral 
JULY 2023 
 
 
INTERNAL TRACKING 
To ensure appropriate follow-up, all laboratory tests and screenings, i.e., mammograms and Pap tests, 
that are sent outside the agency for interpretation shall be reviewed, initialed and dated upon return to the 
LHD by a nurse before it is filed in the patient’s medical record. 
Internal Tracking systems must be developed to ensure that emergency, urgent and essential referrals, 
appointments and return appointments to the health department are made and kept. This system may 
either be electronic or hard copy. A tracking system will help to keep the timeline for the patient’s 
condition and achievement of expected outcomes. It will satisfy patient management and needs by 
avoiding letting patients “slip through the cracks” or stopping short of completing the patient care cycle. 
The system will make sure that problems and care are documented and resolved. Mechanisms for follow- 
up must be sensitive to a patient’s concern for confidentiality and privacy and must be discussed with the 
patient. An agreed-on method for reaching the patient must be determined and noted in the medical 
record. 
A “Tickler File” is one type of internal tracking mechanism. A Tickler is a memorandum book or file that 
aids in coordinating the patient’s care through the problem management and corrective action tracking. 
The Tickler helps to monitor the patient’s course successfully. It is easily managed, flexible and may be 
customized for specific problems. 
          71
Follow-up/Internal Tracking/Referral 
JULY 2023 
 
 
GUIDELINES FOR LABORATORY/RADIOLOGY FOLLOW-UP 
Follow-up on all abnormal laboratory or radiology results are expected. Patients should be notified 
within 10 working days from the LHD receiving the report of the abnormal result. 
Staff shall make a minimum of three attempts to notify patients of abnormal laboratory or radiology tests 
as follows: 
• 
Initial contact may be made by telephone if the number is available, and the patient has permitted 
home contact. 
• 
The second contact should be a regular mailed letter with directions for the patient to contact the 
LHD for follow-up. 
• 
The third should be a certified or registered letter with directions for the patient to contact the LHD 
for follow-up. 
• 
If the patient cannot be contacted by the above measures, a home visit is strongly recommended 
for results that are potentially life threatening. 
• 
If after three attempts are made with no response or three appointments are made and not kept 
by the patient, the LHD provider should document in the chart that the patient is lost to follow-up 
care. 
• 
When the patient is referred to their private medical provider, the follow-up will become the 
private provider’s responsibility. Exception to this will be the KWCSP’s follow-up guidelines. See 
the KWCSP’s Screening/Follow-up section for specific requirements. 
Note: For particular conditions such as abnormal PAP tests results, mammograms, newborn screening, 
and communicable diseases, i.e., TB, HIV, and Hepatitis B, see section program guidelines for required 
follow-up. Program regulations and guidelines will supersede these requirements. 
          72
Follow-up/Internal Tracking/Referral 
JULY 2023 
 
 
REFERRALS 
Referrals are made to assist patients in obtaining services not available on-site. LHDs may not coerce 
patients to undergo any consultation or procedure unwillingly. Referrals may be recommended, arranged 
for, facilitated and/or paid for by the LHD. When this guide indicates that a referral is recommended, the 
obligation of the LHD is to recommend that the patient seek care beyond the capability of the LHD. 
Documentation in the medical record should reflect that the recommendation was made that the patient 
seek further care. It is always appropriate to assist the patient in finding a provider and payment source. 
The significance of the problem will determine whether a referral is an emergency referral, urgent referral, 
an essential referral, and a discretionary or nonessential referral. 
• 
Emergency – required when a patient’s life is in immediate danger. 
• 
Urgent – required when a patient’s condition or problem needs immediate attention, but the 
condition is not thought to be immediately life threatening. 
• 
Essential – required when a patient’s condition or problem needs further attention but waiting for 
an appointment for the care is either not a problem or is appropriate. 
• 
Discretionary or Nonessential – those that would benefit the patient, but for which the patient 
should or could take the initiative. 
 
Written documentation of the outcome, and follow-up of an emergency, urgent or essential referral 
must be obtained. If the patient refuses this level of referral, documentation in the patient’s record is 
essential. Documentation of the patient’s history regarding follow-up with discretionary or nonessential 
referrals is essential. 
 
Patients who are participants in managed care payer systems, such as Health Maintenance 
Organizations (HMOs) or Medicaid Managed Care may be restricted to certain providers or limitations 
when needing specialist care. An individual should not be referred to a specialist without knowing whether 
the primary provider’s authorization is required. 
 
Examples of recommended referrals include: 
• 
Dental referral for children and pregnant women 
• 
Gynecology referral for women with prenatal Diethystil-besterol-DES exposure 
• 
Physician referral for age-appropriate adults to obtain colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, vision and 
hearing assessment (beyond the capability of the health department) 
 
Examples of referrals for which the LHD may pay include: 
• 
Physician referral for child with acute condition in need of diagnosis and treatment (first visit) 
• 
Woman who wants an FDA approved contraceptive not available on site 
• 
Women with an IUD and suspected pelvic inflammatory disease or positive pregnancy test 
• 
Women with abnormal mammogram or Pap test requiring further diagnosis or treatment

Clinical Information and Instructions for Screening and Testing for Hepatitis C Virus 
(HCV) Infection and Billing for HCV Laboratory Tests 
 
 
The Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) encourages all Local Health Departments (LHDs) to 
offer hepatitis C virus (HCV) education, prevention, screening, and treatment referral to all at-risk patients, 
all pregnant persons, and all adults, regardless of risk, for a one-time screening. Please routinely offer 
HCV screening and testing services during healthcare encounters when persons are identified as being at 
risk. 
Hepatitis C, a blood-borne disease, is now primarily spread through intravenous drug use; however, HCV 
can be contracted in other ways from contaminated blood. Hepatitis C is typically a chronic viral infection 
with few early symptoms, and health complications may not appear for decades. Ultimately, patients may 
suffer liver disease, liver cancer, and/or liver failure. 
HCV is transmitted primarily through large or repeated percutaneous (i.e., passage through the skin) 
exposures to infectious blood. Populations and risks identified for potential HCV infections include 
persons who inject drugs (PWID), persons living with HIV; persons with sexual contact with an infected 
person; sharing personal items contaminated with infectious blood, such as razors or toothbrushes; 
perinatal HCV infection; individuals with a history of incarceration; needle stick injuries in healthcare 
setting and persons that have experienced unsafe injection practices in healthcare settings. Persons born 
between 1945 and 1965 (i.e., Baby Boomers), are also at high risk for chronic HCV infection and should 
be tested. https://www.cdc.gov/Hepatitis/HCV/guidelinesc.htm 
Approximately 15%-20% of persons exposed to HCV clear the virus from their bodies without treatment 
and do not develop chronic infection; the reasons are not well known. HCV infection becomes chronic in 
approximately 75%-85% of cases. Prior, resolved HCV infection does not protect against later reinfection, 
regardless of genotype. There is no HCV vaccine. There are effective direct-acting antiviral treatments 
available. 
Approximately 2.2 to 3.2 million persons are living with chronic HCV infection in the United States. The 
Center for Disease Control (CDC) has reported that up to 1.2% of Americans have been chronically 
infected with HCV. In Kentucky, cases of acute Hepatitis C have dramatically increased in both rural and 
urban communities. Current estimates suggest there are over 80,000 Kentuckians living with chronic HCV 
infection. 
Testing and Diagnosis 
Find testing recommendations for Hepatitis C infection here: 
https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/guidelinesc.htm. 
Testing for HCV infection begins with a laboratory-conducted assay for HCV antibody in blood or a rapid 
antibody test. See the Kentucky Adult HCV Screening, Testing and Referral Guidance. KDPH 
recommends that Local Health Departments (LHD) use venipuncture to obtain a specimen for HCV 
Antibody (anti-HCV) testing. HCV Rapid testing is most appropriate for offsite HCV Outreach Programs or 
in Syringe Exchange programs but can be used as a tool within LHDs as long as appropriate follow-up is 
assured. Refer to Appendix 3, the 2-Screening and Referral Guidance for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) 
Infection among High-Risk Individuals and 3- Outreach or Syringe Exchange Programs: Hepatitis C Virus 
(HCV) Rapid Test and Follow Up Guidance. A nonreactive HCV antibody result indicates no HCV 
antibody detected. 
A reactive antibody result indicates one of the following: 1) current HCV infection, 2) past HCV infection 
that has resolved or been treated, or 3) false positivity. A reactive result should be followed by an HCV 
confirmation test using HCV RNA Quantitative tests to detect amount (viral load) of the virus. That 
          76
Hepatitis C Virus 
JULY 2023 
 
 
confirmation test is done automatically (i.e., reflex testing) for HCV tests submitted to the Division of 
Laboratory Services (DLS). 
If HCV RNA is detected, that indicates current HCV infection. If HCV RNA is not detected, that indicates 
either a resolved/treated HCV infection, or false positive HCV antibody. A table on the interpretation of 
results of tests for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection and further actions is available at: 
http://www.cdc.gov/Hepatitis/HCV/PDFs/HCV_graph.pdf. 
How soon after exposure to HCV can anti-HCV be detected? 
HCV infection can be detected by anti-HCV screening tests (enzyme immunoassay) four to ten weeks 
after infection. Anti-HCV can be detected in >97% of persons by six months after exposure. 
How soon after exposure to HCV can HCV RNA be detected? 
HCV RNA appears in blood and can be detected as early as two to three weeks after infection. 
For more information about the CDC HCV recommendations, see the “Testing for HCV infection: An 
Update of Guidance for Clinicians and Laboratorians- 
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6218a5.htm 
Local Health Department Guidance for HCV Screening & Testing: 
• 
Local Health Departments seeking to participate in the Kentucky HCV antibody Screening and 
Testing with HCV RNA Quantitative Confirmation Program should email the Viral Hepatitis 
Program to advise about participation and contact KY Division of Lab Services (DLS) 
dphlabkits@ky.gov to order PPT tubes and shipping/collection information and shipping 
materials. 
HCV Rapid Testing 
• 
KDPH recommends HCV Rapid tests for offsite HCV Outreach Programs or in Syringe Exchange 
Programs. Training on the HCV Rapid can be arranged by contacting the rapid test manufacturer. 
Contact the Viral Hepatitis Program for the contact information. HCV Rapid testing should not 
start until this training has occurred. Test kits and controls have a defined shelf life and should not 
be used beyond their expiration dates. The rapid tests have defined storage and temperature 
guidelines that must be followed. 
• 
Identify Linkage to Care in your region to ensure referrals for further evaluation for those with 
HCV RNA positive test results. Local Health Departments should confirm these providers have 
the capability to provide medical evaluation and treatment for individuals with HCV infection. 
• 
Identify HCV screening, educating, and testing healthcare personnel at your LHD who will provide 
HCV screening and testing services. The Viral Hepatitis Program is available to provide HCV 
Introductory Training upon request. The HCV Introductory Training will include screening, 
collection and handling, reporting, and appropriate counseling messages, with referral and 
linkage to care guidance. 
• 
LHD staff should follow recommended guidance in this document for HCV testing; this includes: 
Confidentiality; Staff training on identifying who is at risk for HCV infection, and the ability to 
provide screening, education, and testing and referral. 
Referral for HCV Management and Treatment 
What should be done for a patient with confirmed HCV infection? 
HCV-positive persons should be linked to care by referral or telehealth to a physician or mid-level clinician 
who treats hepatitis C. 
          77
Hepatitis C Virus 
JULY 2023 
 
 
When might a specialist be consulted in the management of HCV-infected persons? 
Any physician or medical provider who manages a person with Hepatitis C should be knowledgeable and 
current on all aspects of the care of a person with Hepatitis C; this can include specialists such as 
infectious disease physicians, gastroenterologists, or hepatologists, or any primary care provider who has 
been trained to evaluate and treat hepatitis C. 
Counseling Patients 
What topics should be discussed with individuals who have HCV infection? 
• 
Sharing equipment used to inject drugs, not limited to syringes, can potentially spread HCV to 
others. 
• 
Individuals should be informed about the risk for transmission to sex partners. 
• 
Sharing personal items that might have blood on them, such as toothbrushes or razors, can 
pose a risk to others. 
• 
Cuts and sores on the skin should be covered to keep from spreading infectious blood or 
secretions. 
• 
HCV is not spread by sneezing, hugging, holding hands, coughing, sharing eating utensils or 
drinking glasses, or through food or water. 
• 
Individuals may benefit from a joining a local HCV support group. 
What should HCV-infected persons be advised to do to protect their livers from further harm? 
• 
HCV-positive persons should be advised to avoid alcohol because it can accelerate cirrhosis 
and end-stage liver disease. 
• 
Viral hepatitis patients should also check with a health professional before taking any new 
prescription pills, over-the counter drugs (such as non-aspirin pain relievers), or supplements, 
as these can potentially damage the liver. 
Pregnancy and HCV Infection 
Prior to it being a CDC recommendation, Kentucky amended SB 250 KRS 214.160 in 2018 to establish 
that all pregnant women be tested for Hepatitis C and recommend testing for children born from a 
pregnant woman who has a positive Hepatitis C result. Refer to Appendix 4- Hepatitis C (HCV) Infection 
Screening and Referral Guidance for Pregnant Women. HCV infection in pregnant women and infants 
born to mothers with Hepatitis C is reportable to public health officials. Complete the EPID 394 Kentucky 
Reportable Disease Form and fax to 502-564-4760. 
What is the risk that an HCV-infected mother will spread HCV to her infant during birth? 
Approximately 6 of every 100 infants born to HCV-infected mothers become infected with the virus. 
Transmission occurs at the time of birth, and no prophylaxis is available to prevent it. The risk is 
increased by the presence of maternal HCV viremia at delivery and also is two to three times greater if 
the woman is co-infected with HIV. Most infants infected with HCV at birth have no symptoms and do well 
during childhood. More research is needed to find out the long-term effects of perinatal HCV infection. 
There is no evidence that breastfeeding spreads HCV. However, HCV-positive mothers should consider 
abstaining from breastfeeding if their nipples are cracked or bleeding. 
Infants born to mothers with HCV infection 
KDPH recommends HCV RNA testing for Infants born to mothers infected with HCV at the infant's well- 
child visit at age two months or four months. HCV RNA testing should then be repeated at a subsequent 
visit in four to six months, independent of the initial HCV RNA test result if the first test is reported as 
negative. 
          78
Hepatitis C Virus 
JULY 2023 
 
 
An infant born to mothers with HCV infection is reportable to public health officials in Kentucky. Complete 
the EPID 394 Kentucky Reportable Disease Form and fax to 502-564-4760. An alternative anti- HCV 
antibody test (anti-HCV) can be offered no sooner than age 18 months because anti-HCV from the 
mother might last until this age. See Appendix 3 the 5-Screening and Referral Guidance for Infants Born 
to Mothers with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection. Refer children with positive HCV test results to 
identified HCV pediatric specialists in your region. For questions on referral, contact the Viral Hepatitis 
Program. 
HCV Testing Provided at LHDs 
Offer HCV testing to individuals requesting testing or who have risk factors. LHDs may refer an 
individual identified with HCV risk factors whose health insurance coverage will cover the cost of HCV 
testing to a private provider for HCV testing and follow up. If the individual is uninsured or has insurance 
that will not pay for the cost of the HCV test or if the LHD has billing capabilities, the LHD personnel 
qualified in venipuncture will collect and submit a specimen to the Kentucky Division of Lab Services 
(DLS) following guidance from Appendix 3, the 1-Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Antibody and HCV RNA 
Quantitative Specimen Collection and Handling Guidance. HCV testing should occur regardless of the 
individual’s ability to pay that day. The process includes: 
• 
Email dphlabkits@ky.gov to obtain PPT tubes from DLS (Division of Laboratory Services) 
• 
Collect a specimen from the patient using one 8.5mL PPT tube. Spin tube within 6 hours of 
collection. For sites lacking a centrifuge contact DLS at dphlabkits@ky.gov. Specimen should be 
at least 3mL plasma. 
• 
Send spun PPT tube to DLS using ice packs. Specimens collected on Friday should be frozen 
over the weekend and sent the following workday to DLS on ice packs or dry ice. When possible, 
send specimens using overnight mailing system to ensure that the specimens meet the shipping 
guidelines. Specimens will be stable refrigerated for 72 hours and if frozen, 6 weeks. 
• 
DLS will perform the HCV antibody testing. If the antibody testing is positive, DLS will 
automatically reflex to Quantitative HCV RNA testing for confirmation. No second specimen is 
needed. 
Simply collect the specimens using PPT tubes, spin them down, and ship to DLS using ice packs. If you 
have any questions about specimen collection and/or shipping, please contact DLS at 
dphlabkits@ky.gov. Please do not send DLS whole blood for the HCV antibody testing. 
Please note that confirmatory testing will be performed by HCV RNA Quantitative testing. If you need 
assistance interpreting the HCV RNA Quantitative test results, please contact the DLS Supervisor of the 
Virology Section at 502-564-4446.

HIV Testing – Non-Clinical Settings 
Non-Clinical Settings: Rapid Testing Finger Stick 
TRAIN course 1104889, Implementing HIV Testing in Nonclinical Settings, a 3-part module is 
encouraged for clinical providers performing rapid testing. 
Pre-results Steps 
Step 1: Introduce and orient client to session 
• 
Introduce yourself and describe your role 
• 
Provide a brief session overview including: 
o 
How long the session will take 
o 
Process for conducting the test 
o 
How the results are returned (same session) 
• 
Obtain concurrence to proceed with the session 
Step 2: Conduct brief risk screening 
• 
Ask how the client decided to be tested; listen and probe for previous testing history and 
indicators of increased risk including: 
o 
Potential exposure in last 24–72 hours (to indicate need for non-occupational post- 
exposure prophylaxis [nPEP]) 
o 
Potential exposure in last 3 months (to indicate need for acute infection testing, 
retesting 3 months after last exposure, condoms) 
o 
Symptoms (to indicate need for acute infection testing [venipuncture] and accessing 
medical care) 
o 
Ongoing risk behavior or key population (men who have sex with men [MSM], persons 
who inject drugs [PWID], partner with unknown or known HIV-positive status, 
transgender woman) 
• 
Address indicators of increased risk and make immediate referrals to other services (i.e., 
nPEP, acute infection testing, or medical care) as indicated 
• 
Assess the client’s knowledge of HIV transmission, provide accurate information as needed 
• 
Prepare for possible test results 
Step 3: Prepare for and conduct initial instant HIV test (~1 minute read time) 
• 
Explain the process of conducting the HIV test, including: 
o 
Type of test used (instant, HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody test, INSTI) 
o 
Sample collected (fingerstick blood; do not use oral fluid as tests conducted with blood 
are more sensitive for early infection) 
o 
Time until test results are ready (~1 minute) 
• 
Explain the meaning of HIV-negative and HIV-positive test results, including: 
o 
Need for retesting if HIV-negative 
o 
Need for and process of conducting confirmatory testing if HIV-positive 
o 
Possibility of invalid result 
• 
Obtain consent to test (oral or written) 
• 
Distribute test kit information booklet (required for CLIA-waived tests) 
• 
Collect specimen and conduct instant HIV test 
Post-results steps 
Step 4: Provide results of initial instant HIV test and conduct confirmatory testing if needed 
• 
Confirm readiness to receive results 
• 
Provide a clear explanation of results 
o 
NON-REACTIVE (HIV-NEGATIVE) 
o 
REACTIVE (HIV-POSITIVE): Confirmatory testing 
o 
INVALID (RARE): Repeat testing 
Step 5: Develop care, treatment, and prevention plan based on results 
NON-REACTIVE (HIV-NEGATIVE) 
• 
Explore client’s reaction to result 
• 
Discuss need for retesting based on window period of test used and client’s risk 
• 
Emphasize key risk reduction strategies that will help the client remain HIV-negative: 
          87
HIV/AIDS Section 
JULY 2023 
o
Choose less risky sexual behaviors
o
Get tested for HIV together with partner(s)
o
Use condoms consistently and correctly
o
Reduce number of sex partners
o
Talk to the provider about PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) as indicated (according to 
PrEP screening indicators)
o
Talk to the provider about nPEP as indicated (within 3 days following a specific 
exposure to HIV)
o
Get tested and treated for other STDs and encourage partners to do the same
o
If partner is HIV-positive, encourage partner to get and stay on treatment
•
Provide condoms and refer to Syringe Services Programs (SSPs) as
appropriate
REACTIVE (HIV-POSITIVE) 
•
Explore client’s reaction to result
•
Advise on next steps for follow-up testing
•
The Kentucky Department for Public Health supported HIV testing in nonclinical settings
employ option #2. For clinical sites, #1 and #2 are options for follow-up.
1. Collect a specimen to send to the Department of Laboratory Services (DLS) for
confirmatory testing after the initial reactive instant test result; discuss the importance of
returning to the agency to get the test result; and schedule a day and time for the client to
return to the agency to get the follow-up test result.
2. Collect a specimen and run a second rapid test using a different rapid test to confirm the
result. If the second test is also reactive, proceed with steps 5 and 6. For a nonreactive
confirmatory result, refer the client to a clinical provider or collect a sample to send to DLS.
•
Discuss disclosure and inform about processes for partner services
•
Advise to access care and treatment for HIV
o
Treatment can help people with HIV live long, healthy lives and prevent transmission
o
Other health issues can be addressed
•
Emphasize key risk reduction strategies that will prevent transmission
o
Choose less risky sexual and drug-using behaviors
o
Get tested together with their partners
o
Use condoms consistently and correctly
o
Reduce number of sex partners
o
Encourage partners to be tested
•
Provide condoms
Step 6: Refer and link with medical care, social and behavioral services 
•
Identify necessary medical, social and behavioral referral services
•
Make referrals as indicated, including to SSPs as appropriate
•
Track linkage to HIV medical care
Complete and submit EvaluationWeb HIV Test form for all state-sponsored HIV tests within 2 weeks. 
HIV Testing – Clinical Settings 
Clinical Settings: Laboratory Testing/Venipuncture 
•
If possible, persons at highest risk should be tested for acute infection.
•
If a client is concerned about a recent exposure or reports symptoms of acute HIV infection
such as persistent fever, swollen throat or lymph nodes, or other severe flu-like symptoms,
they should undergo laboratory testing.
•
The need for using protection until acute infection can be ruled out should be emphasized.
•
If testing immediately for acute infection is not an option, then the client should be tested using
the non-clinical site protocol above and then retested 3 months after their potential exposure.
•
In general, tests used for acute infection will be antigen/antibody combination tests used with
blood specimens collected from the vein.
•
The DLS screening test is Bio-Rad HIV Combo Ag/Ab EIA. A positive screening test is
confirmed with the Bio-Rad Geenius HIV 1/2 Supplemental Assay.
•
Schedule a follow-up appointment for test results ideally with the same provider.
          88
HIV/AIDS Section 
JULY 2023 
 
 
• 
If negative, advise retest 3 months from last exposure and make appropriate referrals (PrEP, 
SSP, vaccinations, etc.). Offer screening services for other STI and condoms. 
• 
If positive, refer to HIV care through HIV Care Coordinator program, with a goal of linking HIV 
positive persons to care within 7 days. Advise patient will be contacted by Partner Services to 
identify and notify sexual partners and syringe sharing partners of need for testing. Encourage 
those who tested anonymously to agree to confidential services. Offer screening services for 
other STI and TB, provide condoms, offer vaccinations, and advise on SSP. 
Complete and submit EvaluationWeb HIV Test form for all state-sponsored HIV tests within 2 weeks 
after giving results to patient. If patient does not return within 2 months for results, complete and submit 
form to the HIV/AIDS Section. Retain the original copy at the local site for at least one year in case the 
patient returns (in which case, update and resubmit form). 
How to collect sample and send to State Lab (DLS) 
• 
Enter patient demographics into Outreach. Print labels from Outreach and fix to specimen tube. 
• 
Collect and submit 7-10 ml red stopper tube of whole blood to the Virology Section of DLS. Two 
unique patient identifiers must be present on the tube and the label from Outreach. 
• 
Confidential Test: Two unique patient identifiers on lab form and specimen tube. (preferred) 
• 
Anonymous Test: ID number only on lab form and specimen tube. 
• 
Court-Ordered Test: Name and ID number or another patient identifier must be on lab form and 
specimen tube. Send the most recent version of the Administrative Order of the Courts Form 
499 to DLS with the specimen. 
HIV Testing Non-Clinical and Clinical Sites 
Confidential tests are preferred over anonymous tests. 
Positive results must be reported to the Kentucky Department for Public Health within 5 business days. 
For reporting requirements, see https://chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph/dehp/hab/Pages/reportsstats.aspx. 
Once reported, a Disease Intervention Specialist (DIS) will provide Partner Services for persons 
diagnosed with HIV disease and are available statewide. 
For Kentucky HIV Care Coordinator locations, please see: 
https://chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph/dehp/hab/Pages/services.aspx. 
For Kentucky HIV/AIDS Prevention Programs and EvaluationWeb HIV testing form go to 
https://chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph/dehp/hab/Pages/prevention.aspx. All state sponsored HIV tests 
(positive and negative) must have a completed EvaluationWeb form. 
 
 
CDC recommends that all adolescents and adults get tested at least once for HIV as a routine part of 
medical care, and that MSM and others at high risk for HIV infection be tested at least annually. In 
addition, MSM and other persons participating in high risk activities might benefit from more frequent 
screening, such as every 3 to 6 months.

• If the recipient has received 3 (three) or more doses of the Moderna COVID-19 
vaccine Administer 1 (one) dose 8 weeks after receipt of the last dose (Dark BLUE 
Cap-GREEN Label 0.25 ML) 
NOTE: Children ages 6 months–4 years who are moderately or severely 
immunocompromised have the option to receive 1 (one) additional dose of a 
homologous updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine at least 2 months following 
the last recommended updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine dose. Further 
additional homologous updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA dose(s) may be 
administered, informed by the clinical judgement of a healthcare provider and personal 
preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at 
least 2 months after the last updated (2023–2024 Formula) mRNA vaccine dose. For 
Moderna, administer 0.25 mL/25 ug (Dark BLUE Cap-GREEN Label) 
 
Special situation: Children ages 6 months–4 years should receive all doses of COVID-19 vaccine from 
the same manufacturer; this includes children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised and 
those who are not.  
In the following exceptional situations, a different age-appropriate COVID-19 vaccine may be 
administered: 
• Same vaccine not available 
• Previous dose unknown 
• Person would otherwise not complete the vaccination series 
• Person starts but unable to complete a vaccination series with the same COVID-19 vaccine due 
to a contraindication 
A Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) report is not indicated for these exceptional 
situations. 
For people who receive 1 Moderna and 1 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose, complete the initial 
vaccination series as follows: 
• Children ages 6 months–4 years who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised 
should follow a 3-dose schedule. A third dose of either updated (2023–2024 Formula) Moderna vaccine 
or updated (2023–2024 Formula) Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should be administered at least 8 weeks after 
the second dose. 
• People ages 6 months and older who are moderately or severely immunocompromised should 
follow the recommended 3-dose schedule. A third dose of either updated (2023–2024 Formula) Moderna 
vaccine or updated (2023–2024 Formula) Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should be administered as follows:  
• Ages 6 months–4 years: at least 8 weeks after the second dose 
Individuals who will turn from 4 years old to 5 years old 
If a person moves to an older age group between vaccine doses, they should receive the vaccine product 
and dosage for the older age group for all subsequent doses. However, for children who transition from 
age 4 years to age 5 years and children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised and 
transition from age 11 years to age 12 years, FDA authorization allows for an alternative dosage. For 
children who transition from age 4 years to age 5 years during the initial vaccination series: 
Moderna series: Children are recommended to complete the 2-dose series with updated (2023–2024 
Formula) Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, 0.25 mL/25 ug (dark blue cap; green label), as per the FDA 
EUA; there is no dosage change. 
Children with a history of myocarditis or pericarditis: 
People who have a history of myocarditis or pericarditis that occurred before COVID-19 
vaccination or more than 3 weeks after a COVID-19 vaccine dose may receive any currently 
FDA-approved or FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine after the episode of myocarditis or 
Immunization: Moderna 6mths-4 years

Management of Acute Allergic Reactions 
• 
Appropriate medical treatment to manage immediate allergic reactions must be 
immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs 
following administration of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. 
• 
Monitor Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of 
immediate adverse reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-
19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html) 
 
 
Myocarditis and Pericarditis 
• 
Post marketing data demonstrate increased risks of myocarditis and 
pericarditis, particularly within 7 days following the second dose. The observed 
risk is highest in males 18 through 24 years of age. Although some cases 
required intensive care support, available data from short- term follow-up 
suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with conservative 
management. Information is not yet available about potential long-term sequelae. 
The CDC has published considerations related to myocarditis and pericarditis 
after vaccination, including for vaccination of individuals with a history of 
myocarditis or pericarditis (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-

Management of Acute Allergic Reactions 
• 
Appropriate medical treatment to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately 
available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of the 
Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. 
• 
Monitor Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse 
reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines 
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html) 
Myocarditis and Pericarditis 
• 
Post marketing data demonstrate increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly 
within 7 days following the second dose. The observed risk is highest in males 18 through 24 
years of age. Although some cases required intensive care support, available data from short- 
term follow-up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with conservative 
management. Information is not yet available about potential long-term sequelae. The CDC has 
published considerations related to myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination, including for 
vaccination of individuals with a history of myocarditis or pericarditis 
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html)

STANDING ORDERS FOR 
Administering Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Acellular Pertussis (DTaP) Vaccine to 
Children Younger Than Age 7 Years 
 
Purpose 
To reduce morbidity and mortality from tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis by vaccinating all 
infants and children who meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). 
 
Policy  
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses and other healthcare 
professionals (e.g., pharmacists) to assess the need for and vaccinate children and teens who 
meet any of the criteria below. 
 
Procedure 
1. Assess Children in Need of Vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis based 
on the following criteria: 
 Age 2 months through 6 years who have not completed a DTaP vaccination series 
 
2. Screen for contraindications and 
precautions Contraindications 
 Do not give DTaP vaccine to an infant or child who has experienced a serious reaction (e.g., 
anaphylaxis) to a prior dose of the vaccine or to any of its components. For information on 
vaccine 
components, 
refer 
to 
the 
manufacturers’ 
package 
insert 
(www.immunize.org/packageinserts) 
or 
go 
to 
www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/ 
pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf. 
 Do not give any DTaP to an infant or child who has experienced encephalopathy (e.g., 
coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) not attributable to another 
identifiable cause within 7 days following a previous dose of DTaP. 
Precautions 
 Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever 
 History of Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of previous dose of tetanus toxoid- 
containing vaccine 
 History of an Arthus-type hypersensitivity reaction after a previous dose of DTaP; in such 
cases, defer vaccination until at least 10 years have elapsed since the last tetanus toxoid- 
containing vaccine 
 Progressive neurologic disorder (including infantile spasms), uncontrolled epilepsy, or 
progressive encephalopathy until a treatment regimen has been established and the 
condition has stabilized 
 
3. Provide Vaccine Information Statements 
Provide all patients (or, in the case of minors, their parent, or legal representative) with a 
copy of the most current federal Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). Provide non- 
English speaking patients with a copy of the VIS in their native language, if one is 
available and desired; these can be found at www.immunize.org/vis. (For information 
about how to document that the VIS was given, see section 6 titled “Document

Indications and Usage 
 
• 
PEDIARIX is a vaccine indicated for active immunization against diphtheria, 
tetanus, pertussis, infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B 
virus, and poliomyelitis. 
• 
PEDIARIX is approved for use as a 3-dose series in infants born of hepatitis 
B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative mothers. Per ACIP guidance, 
PEDIARIX may be used in infants born to women whose HBsAg status is 
positive or unknown beginning no earlier than age 6 weeks. PEDIARIX may 
be given as early as 6 weeks of age through 6 years of age (prior to the 7th 
birthday). 
 
Recommended Schedule 
 
• 
DTaP-HepB-IPV is approved for the primary series routinely given at 2, 4 and 6 months 
of age. The recommended interval between doses is 6 to 8 weeks (preferably 8 
weeks). 
• 
DTaP-HepB-IPV is approved for use in children aged 6 weeks through 6 years (prior to 
the 7th birthday). A child who is behind schedule can still receive DTaP-HepB-IPV as 
long as it is given for doses 1, 2 or 3 of the series and the child is less than 7 years of 
age. 
• 
DTaP-HepB-IPV can be used to complete the primary series in infants who have begun with 
the separate vaccines. 
• 
DTaP-HepB-IPV can be administered simultaneously with other vaccines given at 
separate injection sites. Please refer to the section below on Adverse Events for 
additional information. 
 
Minimum Ages and Intervals 
 
• 
The recommended minimum age and interval for each dose are equivalent to the oldest 
age or longest interval recommended for any of the individual components for that dose. 
For example, the minimum age for dose #1 is 6 weeks (the same as DTaP and IPV), 
while the minimum age for the third dose is 24 weeks (the same as HepB). 
• 
If an accelerated schedule is used, the minimum interval between the 1st and 2nd doses 
is 6 weeks; and between the 2nd and 3rd doses is 8 weeks, but the 3rd dose should not 
be given before age 24 weeks. Please refer to the table below.

Dosage and Route 
• 
Shake vigorously to obtain a homogeneous, turbid, white suspension. Do not use if resuspension does not occur with 
vigorous shaking. Give PEDIARIX® vaccine 0.5 mL intramuscularly (IM). Do not administer this product intravenously, 
intradermally, or subcutaneously. 
• 
Always check the package insert prior to administration of any vaccine. 
 
Anatomical Site 
The preferred administration site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh for children younger than 1 year. In older children, the 
deltoid muscle is usually large enough for an intramuscular injection. The vaccine should not be injected in the gluteal area or 
areas where there may be a major nerve trunk. 
 
Document Vaccination 
 
• 
Document each patient’s vaccine administration information and follow-up in the following 
places: 
o 
Medical record: 
 
Record the date the vaccine was administered, the manufacturer and lot number, 
the vaccination site and route, and the name and title of the person administering 
the vaccine. You must also document, in the patient’s medical record or office 
log, the publication date of the VIS and the date it was given to the patient. Note 
that medical records/charts should be documented and retained in accordance 
with applicable state laws and regulations. If vaccine was not administered, 
record the reason(s) for non-receipt of the vaccine (e.g., medical contra- 
indication, patient refusal). Discuss the need for vaccine with the patient at the 
next visit. 
o 
Personal immunization record card: 
 
Record the date of vaccination and the name/location of the administering clinic. 
o 
Immunization Information System (IIS) or “registry”: 
 
Report the vaccination to the appropriate state/local IIS, if available. 
 
Be Prepared to Manage Medical Emergencies 
 
• 
Be prepared for management of a medical emergency related to the administration of vaccine 
by having a written emergency medical protocol available, as well as equipment and 
medications. For IAC’s “Medical Management of Vaccine Reactions in Adult Patients in a 
Community Setting,” go to www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3082.pdf. For “Medical Management of 
Vaccine Reactions in Children and Teens in a Community Setting,” go to 
www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3082a.pdf. 
• 
To prevent syncope, vaccinate patients while they are seated or lying down and consider 
observing them for 15 minutes after receipt of the vaccine.

STANDING ORDER FOR 
Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, 
Inactivated Poliovirus and Haemophilus b Conjugate (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate) Vaccine 
DTaP-IPV/Hib Combination Vaccine (Pentacel®) 
 
 
Purpose 
• 
To reduce mortality from diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and poliomyelitis and invasive disease 
due to Haemophilus influenzae type b for infant and children who meet the criteria established 
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices (ACIP). 
 
Policy 
• 
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses and other healthcare 
professionals (e.g., pharmacists) to assess the need for and vaccinate children and teens who 
meet any of the criteria below. 
• 
Review the package insert prior to administration and confirm storage and handling 
guidance 
 
Procedure 
• 
Pentacel is a vaccine indicated for active immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, 
poliomyelitis and invasive disease due to Haemophilus influenzae type b. Pentacel is approved 
for use as a four-dose series in children 6 weeks through 4 years of age (prior to 5th birthday) 
 
Screen for Contraindications and Precautions 
• 
Contraindications 
o 
Severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of Pentacel, 
any ingredient of Pentacel, or any other diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, 
pertussis-containing vaccine, inactivated poliovirus vaccine or H.influenzae type b 
vaccine. 
o 
Encephalopathy within 7 days of a previous pertussis-containing vaccine 
with no other identifiable cause. 
o 
Progressive neurologic disorder until a treatment regimen has been 
established and the condition has stabilized. 
• 
Precautions 
o 
Carefully consider benefits and risks before administering Pentacel to 
persons with a history of: 
 
fever ≥40.5°C (≥105°F) 
 
hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (HHE) or 
 
persistent, inconsolable crying lasting ≥3 hours within 48 hours after a 
previous pertussis-containing vaccine. 
 
seizures within 3 days after a previous pertussis-containing vaccine. 
o 
If Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior 
vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome 
may be increased following Pentacel. 
o 
For infants and children with a history of previous seizures, an antipyretic may be 
administered (in the dosage recommended in its prescribing information) at the 
time of vaccination with Pentacel and for the 
next 24 hours. 
o 
Apnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some 
infants born prematurely. The decision about when to administer an 
intramuscular vaccine, including Pentacel, to an infant born prematurely 
should be based on consideration of the individual infant’s medical status 
and the potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination.

Standing Orders for Administering Hepatitis A Vaccine to Children and Teens 
 
Purpose 
To reduce morbidity and mortality from hepatitis A virus (HAV) by vaccinating all children and 
teens who meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). 
 
Policy  
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses and other healthcare 
professionals (e.g., pharmacists) to assess the need for and vaccinate children and teens 
who meet any of the criteria below. 
 
Procedure 
1. Assess Children and Teens in Need of Vaccination against HAV infection based 
on the following criteria: 
• 
age 12–23 months and lacking documentation of at least 1 dose of hepatitis A vaccine 
(HepA) 
• 
age 2 through 18 years who are unvaccinated or have not completed a HepA series 
• 
age 6 months and older with anticipated travel to a country with intermediate or high 
endemicity for hepatitis A (i.e., all except Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and 
parts of Western Europe) (Note: A dose given at age 6–11 months does not count 
toward the routine 2-dose series given after the first birthday.) 
2. Screen for contraindications and precautions 
Contraindications 
• 
Do not give HepA to a child or teen who has experienced a serious reaction (e.g., 
anaphylaxis) to a prior dose of the vaccine or to any of its components. For information 
on vaccine components, refer to the manufacturers’ package insert 
(www.immunize.org/fda) or go to www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/ 
appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf. 
Precautions 
• 
Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever 
3. Provide Vaccine Information Statements 
• 
Provide all patients (or, in the case of minors, their parent, or legal representative) with a 
copy of the most current federal Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). Provide non- 
English speaking patients with a copy of the VIS in their native language, if one is 
available and desired; these can be found at www.immunize.org/vis. (For information 
about how to document that the VIS was given, see section 6 titled “Document 
Vaccination.”)

FOOTNOTES 
1 Infants younger than age 6 months and older children for whom vaccine is contraindicated should be given 
IG at a dose of 0.1 mL/kg for travel of up to 1 month’s time. For travel of 2 months or longer, they should be 
given IG 0.2 mL/kg and repeat dose of 0.2 mL/kg for every 2 months that travel continues. Because IG might 
interfere with live virus vaccines, when MMR or varicella vaccine is indicated, give at least 2 weeks before giving IG or 
at least 6 months after giving IG. 
2 A dose given at age 6–11 months does not count toward the routine 2-dose series given after the first birthday. 
 
6. Document Vaccination 
• 
Document each patient’s vaccine administration information and follow-up in the 
following places: 
• 
Medical record: Record the date the vaccine was administered, the manufacturer and lot

Standing Order for Administration of Hepatitis A Vaccine to Adults 
 
Purpose 
 
• 
To reduce morbidity and mortality from hepatitis A virus (HAV) by vaccinating all adults 
who meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). 
 
Policy 
 
• 
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses and other healthcare 
professionals (e.g., pharmacists) to assess the need for and vaccinate adults who meet any 
of the criteria below. 
• 
Review the package insert prior to administration and confirm storage and handling 
guidance. 
 
Procedure 
 
• 
Assess Adults in Need of Vaccination against HAV infection based on the following 
criteria: 
o 
anticipated travel to a country with intermediate or high endemicity for hepatitis A (i.e., all 
except Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Western Europe) 
o 
a male who has sex with other males 
o 
users of street drugs (injecting and non-injecting) 
o 
homelessness or living in temporary housing (such as a shelter) 
o 
diagnosis of chronic liver disease (including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, fatty 
liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, alanine aminotransferase 
[ALT], or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] level greater than twice the upper limit of 
normal) 
o 
diagnosis of HIV infection 
o 
anticipated close personal contact with an international adoptee from a country of high 
or intermediate endemicity during the first 60 days after the arrival of the adoptee in the 
United States 
o 
employment in a research laboratory requiring work with HAV or HAV-infected 
primates 
o 
recent possible exposure to HAV (e.g., within previous two weeks) (Note: For adults 
older than age 40 years with recent exposure to HAV, immune globulin [IC; 0.1 mL/kg] 
may also be administered depending on the provider’s risk assessment [see 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/59777]). 
o 
any other adult who wants to be protected from hepatitis A 
• 
Note: In settings where a high proportion of people have risk factors for hepatitis A infection, assume that 
unvaccinated adults age 19 years and older are at risk without individual risk-factor screening. Such 
settings include a) healthcare settings targeting services to injection or non-injection drug users and b) group 
homes or nonresidential daycare facilities for developmentally disabled persons. 
Screen for Contraindications and Precautions

JULY 2023 
 
 
Notes: 
 
• 
For HIV-infected people, Hep A vaccination may be less protective. CDC recommends HIV- 
positive people receive immune globulin (0.1 mL/kg) within 2 weeks of a high-risk exposure to 
hepatitis A virus (e.g., household contact or sexual partner), regardless of vaccination status. 
• 
For travelers needing pre-exposure protection against hepatitis A: 
• 
If healthy and age 40 years or younger, 1 dose of Hep A before departure will provide 
adequate protection. 
• 
If age 41 years or older, immunocompromised, having chronic liver disease or other 
chronic medical condition, and departure is anticipated within the next 2 weeks, 
administer the initial dose of Hep A vaccine. Immune globulin (0.1 mL/kg for travel up to 1 
month; 0.2 mL/kg for travel up to 2 months; 0.2 mL/kg every 2 months travel of >2 months 
duration) may also be administered simultaneously at a separate anatomic site. 
 
 
Document Vaccination 
 
• 
Document each patient’s vaccine administration information and follow-up in the following 
places: 
o 
Medical record: 
 
Record the date the vaccine was administered, the manufacturer and lot number, 
the vaccination site and route, and the name and title of the person administering 
the vaccine. You must also document, in the patient’s medical record or office 
log, the publication date of the VIS and the date it was given to the patient. Note 
that medical records/charts should be documented and retained in accordance 
with applicable state laws and regulations. If vaccine was not administered, 
record the reason(s) for non-receipt of the vaccine (e.g., medical contra- 
indication, patient refusal). Discuss the need for vaccine with the patient at the 
next visit. 
o

virus and infection by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus. 
• 
TWINRIX is approved for use in persons 18 years of age or older. 
Screen for Contraindications and Precautions 
 
• 
Contraindications 
o 
Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any 
hepatitis A-containing or hepatitis B-containing vaccine, or to any component 
of TWINRIX, including yeast and neomycin. 
 
o  
• 
Precautions 
The tip caps of the prefilled syringes contain natural rubber latex which 
may cause allergic reaction. 
o 
Syncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable 
vaccines, including TWINRIX. Procedures should be in place to avoid 
falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope 
 
Provide Vaccine Information Statements 
 
•

o 
Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for travelers to areas of high or 
intermediate hepatitis A endemicity 
 
• 
Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for travelers to areas of high or intermediate 
hepatitis B endemicity who plan to stay for six or more months and have frequent close 
contact with the local population. 
• 
Persons at increased risk due to occupational exposure 
• 
Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for unvaccinated persons who anticipate close 
personal contact (e.g., household contact or regular babysitting) with an international 
adoptee from a country of high or intermediate endemicity during the first 60 days 
following arrival of the adoptee in the United States. Countries outside the US other 
than Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Western Europe should be 
considered to have high or intermediate endemicity for hepatitis A virus. 
 
Recommended Schedule 
• 
Standard dosing schedule consists of 3 doses (1-mL each), given intramuscularly at 
0, 1, and 6 months. Alternatively, an accelerated schedule of 4 doses (1-mL each), 
given intramuscularly on Days 0, 7, and 21 to 30 followed by a booster dose at 
Month 12 may be used. 
Dosage and Route 
• 
Suspension for injection available in 1-mL prefilled TIP-LOK syringes 
• 
The vaccine should be re-suspended before use. When re-suspended, the vaccine will have a uniform hazy 
white appearance. 
• 
TWINRIX should be administered by intramuscular injection only as a 1-mL dose. Administer in the deltoid region. Do 
not administer in the gluteal region; such injections may result in a suboptimal response. 
• 
Attach a sterile needle to the prefilled syringe and administer intramuscularly. 
• 
Do not administer this product intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously. 
 
Anatomical Site 
• 
For adults (persons 18 years of age and older) the deltoid muscle is recommended for routine intramuscular 
vaccinations. The suggested needle size is 1-1½ inches and 22-25 gauge. 
 
Other Important Notes 
• 
If administered concomitantly with immune globulin (IG), use a separate 
syringe and different site. 
• 
Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) during hepatitis A outbreaks or as part of a 
contact investigation. TWINRIX vaccine should not be used for hepatitis 
A PEP. Use single antigen hepatitis A vaccine for hepatitis A PEP, when 
hepatitis A vaccine is indicated. See the Hepatitis A vaccine protocol for 
additional details. 
 
Document Vaccination 
 
• 
Document each patient’s vaccine administration information and follow-up in the 
following places: 
o 
Medical record: 
 
Record the date the vaccine was administered, the manufacturer and lot 
number, the vaccination site and route, and the name and title of the 
person administering the vaccine. You must also document, in the 
patient’s medical record or office log, the publication date of the VIS and 
the date it was given to the patient. Note that medical records/charts 
should be documented and retained in accordance with applicable state 
laws and regulations. If vaccine was not administered, record the 
reason(s) for non-receipt of the vaccine (e.g., medical contra- indication, 
          143
 
patient refusal). Discuss the need for vaccine with the patient at the next 
visit. 
o 
Personal immunization record card: 
 
Record the date of vaccination and the name/location of the administering clinic.

JULY 2023 
Immunization-Hep B Adult 
STANDING ORDERS FOR 
Administering Hepatitis B Vaccine to Adults 
Purpose 
•
To reduce morbidity and mortality from hepatitis B virus (HBV) by vaccinating all adults who
meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices.
Policy 
•
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses, pharmacists, and other
health care professionals to assess the need for vaccination and to vaccinate adults who meet
any of the criteria below.
•
Review the package insert prior to administration and confirm storage and handling
guidance.
Procedure 
• Assess Adults for Need of Vaccination against HBV infection1,2,3 according to the following
criteria:
o
All adults age 19 through 59 years
o
All adults age 60 or older with risk factors for HBV infection due to:

Sexual exposure risk
•
sex partners of hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]-positive people
•
sexually active people not in monogamous relationships
•
people seeking treatment for a sexually-transmitted infection
•
men who have sex with men
o
Percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood:

current or recent injection-drug use

household contacts of HBsAg-positive people

residents and staff of facilities for developmentally disabled people

healthcare and public safety workers with risk for exposure to blood or blood- 
contaminated body fluids

hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, home dialysis, and predialysis patients

patients with diabetes at the discretion of the treating clinician
o
Other factors

anticipated travel to countries with high or intermediate endemic hepatitis B

people with hepatitis C infection

chronic liver disease (including, but not limited to people with cirrhosis, fatty liver
disease, alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and an alanine
aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] level greater than
twice upper limit of normal)

HIV infection

incarceration
o
Any adult age 60 or older who does not meet the risk-based recommendations above may
be vaccinated.
Notes: 
1. 
1. In general, people who have documented completion of a Hep B series at any point or who have a history of previous
HBV infection should not receive additional Hep B vaccine, although there is no evidence that additional vaccination is
harmful.
2. 
2. Revaccination may be indicated for certain high-risk adults, including healthcare workers who are documented non- responders 
to an initial Hep B series, and certain dialysis patients. For revaccination guidance, see the 2018 ACIP recommendations for the 
prevention of hepatitis B at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/pdfs/rr6701-H.PDF (pages 23-24).
3. 
4. 
3. In settings where the patient population has a high rate of previous HBV infection, prevaccination testing, which may
be performed at the same visit when the first dose of vaccine is administered, might reduce costs by avoiding complete
vaccination of people who are already immune. However, prevaccination testing is not required and should not create a
barrier to vaccination.
          148
Screen for Contraindications and Precautions 
JULY 2023 
Immunization-Hep B Adult 
 
 
 
• 
Contraindications 
o 
Do not give hepatitis B vaccine to a person who has experienced a serious systemic 
or anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of the vaccine or to any of its components. For 
a list of vaccine components, refer to the manufacturer’s package insert 
(www.immunize.org/fda) or go to 
www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/ excipient-table-2.pdf. 
• 
Precautions 
o 
Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever 
o 
Pregnancy 
o 
Pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination; however, data on 
Heplisav-B and PreHevbrio are currently insufficient to reach any 
conclusions concerning vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. Thus, 
providers should vaccinate pregnant people needing Hep B vaccination 
with Engerix-B, Recombivax HB, or Twinrix. 
 
Provide Vaccine Information Statements 
 
• 
Provide all patients with a copy of the most current federal Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). 
Provide non-English speaking patients with a copy of the VIS in their native language, if one is 
available and desired; these can be found at www.immunize.org/vis. (For information about how

2. 
The hepatitis B vaccine series does not need to be 
restarted, regardless of the time that has elapsed between doses. 
 
Information on Certain Risk Groups 
 
• 
For persons born in Asia, the Pacific Islands, Africa, or other countries identified as having high rates 
of HBV infection, see www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5416.pdf (page 25), ensure that they have also 
been tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to find out if they are chronically infected. If test is 
performed on same visit, administer hepatitis B vaccine after the blood draw. Do not delay initiating 
hepatitis B vaccination while waiting for test results. If patient is found to be HBsAg-positive, 
appropriate medical follow-up should be provided; no further doses of hepatitis B vaccine are 
indicated. 
• 
Certain people need testing for immunity (anti-HBs) 1–2 months following vaccination. Check ACIP 
recommendations for details at www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/pdfs/rr6701-H.pdf (page 25).

date of the VIS and the date it was given to the patient. Note that medical records/charts should 
be documented and retained in accordance with applicable state laws and regulations. If vaccine 
was not administered, record the reason(s) for non-receipt of the vaccine (e.g., medical 
contraindication, patient refusal). Offer the vaccine to the patient at the next visit. 
Personal immunization record card: Record the date of vaccination and the name/location of the 
administering clinic. 
Immunization Information System (IIS) or “registry”: Report the vaccination to the 
appropriate state/local IIS, if available. 
7. Be Prepared to Manage Medical Emergencies

Immunization-HIBERIX 
JULY 2023 
 
 
STANDING ORDER FOR 
Haemophilus influenzae Type b (Hib) Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine - HIBERIX® 
 
 
Purpose 
• 
To reduce mortality from tetanus and Haemophilous Influenzae Type b for children 6 weeks 
through 4 years old (prior to 5th birthday) who meet the criteria established by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). 
 
Policy 
• 
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses and other healthcare 
professionals (e.g., pharmacists) to assess the need for and vaccinate children and teens who 
meet any of the criteria below. 
• 
Review the package insert prior to administration and confirm storage and handling 
guidance 
 
Procedure 
• 
A 4-dose series (0.5-mL each) given by intramuscular injection 
o 
Primary series: One dose each at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The first dose 
may be given as early as 6 weeks of age. 
o 
Booster: One dose at 15 through 18 months of age 
Screen for Contraindications and Precautions 
 
• 
Contraindications 
o 
Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any 
H. influenzae type b- or tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine or any component 
of HIBERIX 
 
• 
Precautions 
o 
If Guillain-Barré syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a 
prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the decision to give HIBERIX 
should be based on potential benefits and risks. 
o 
Syncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of 
injectable vaccines, including HIBERIX. Procedures should be in place to 
avoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope. 
o 
Apnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some 
infants born prematurely. Decisions about when to administer an 
intramuscular vaccine, including HIBERIX, to infants born prematurely 
should be based on consideration of the individual infant’s medical status, 
and the potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination.

To reduce morbidity and mortality from human papillomavirus (HPV) infection by vaccinating 
all adults who meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). 
 
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses and other healthcare 
professionals (e.g., pharmacists) to assess the need for and vaccinate adults who meet any of 
the criteria below. 
Procedure 
1. Assess adults for need of vaccination against human papillomavirus infection based on the following 
criteria: 
• Adults, age 26 years or younger 
• Adults, age 27 through 45 years, based on shared clinical decision making. (Note: Although 
many adults ages 27–45 years have prior exposures to 1 or more HPV types, most have not been exposed 
to all 9 HPV types that are contained in the vaccine. Also, at any age, having a new sex partner is a risk 
factor for being exposed to a new HPV infection.) 
2. Screen for contraindications and 
precautions 
Contraindication 
Do not give HPV vaccine to an adult who has experienced a serious systemic or anaphylactic 
reaction to a prior dose of HPV vaccine or to any of its components (e.g., yeast). For 
information on vaccine components, refer to the manufacturers’ package insert

Immunization: Adult Influenza 
  August 2023 
Administering Influenza Vaccine to Adults 18 years and older 
Purpose 
Policy 
To reduce morbidity and mortality from influenza by vaccinating all adults who meet the criteria established by the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). 
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare 
professionals to assess the need for vaccination and to vaccinate adults who meet any of the criteria below. 
Procedure 
•
Review package insert.
•
Assess Adults for Need of Vaccination against Influenza
• All adults 18 years and older are recommended to receive influenza vaccination each year.
• Adults aged 65 and older should preferentially receive any one of the following higher doses or
adjuvanted influenza vaccines: quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4),
quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted IIV (aIIV4, Fluad). If
none of these three vaccines are available, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be
used.
• Adults who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season. Administer any recommended, age- 
appropriate quadrivalent IIV (IIV4) or RIV4 to pregnant people in any trimester.
• Adults who do not recall whether they received influenza vaccine in the current vaccination season should
be vaccinated.
• Adults who recently received or are planning to receive COVID-19 vaccine may be administered influenza
vaccine either simultaneously (on the same day, at separate anatomic sites) or at any time before or after
COVID-19 vaccine. Interim clinical considerations and detailed current guidance for the use of
COVID-19 vaccines are available at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-
vaccines- us.html. Information on coadministration of all vaccines can be found at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/
hcp/acip- recs/general-recs/timing.html and information on giving two (2) or more intramuscular vaccines
can be found at https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2030.pdf
•
Screen for Contraindications and Precautions
• Contraindications for use of all influenza vaccines
• Do not give any egg-based IIV4 to a person who has experienced a serious systemic or
anaphylactic reaction to any component of the vaccine (except egg), or to a prior dose of any
influenza vaccine (i.e., egg-based IIV, cell culture-based IIV [ccIIV], RIV, or live attenuated
influenza vaccine [LAIV]).
• Do not give ccIIV4 to a person who has experienced a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction to
any component of ccIIV4 or to a prior dose of any ccIIV.
• Do not give any RIV4 to a person who has experienced a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction
to any component of RIV4 or to a prior dose of any RIV.
• Do not give any LAIV4 to a person who has experienced a serious systemic or anaphylactic
reaction to any component of LAIV4 or to a prior dose of any influenza vaccine (egg-based IIV,
ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV).
• For a list of vaccine components, refer to the manufacturer’s package insert
(www.immunize.org/fda) or go to www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood- 
biologics/vaccines/vaccines-licensed-use-united-states.
•
Additional contraindications for use of LAIV4 only

Do not give LAIV4 to a person who:
• is pregnant
• has functional or anatomic asplenia, cochlear implant, or is immunocompromised due to
any cause (including immunosuppression caused by medications or HIV infection)
Immunization: Adult Influenza 
 August 2023 
• has active communication between CSF and the oropharynx, nose, or ear or any other cranial
CSF leak
• is age 50 years or older
• received influenza antivirals before scheduled vaccination (zanamivir or oseltamivir within
48 hours; peramivir within 5 days; baloxavir within 17 days). If any of these antiviral drugs
are taken within 14 days after LAIV4, revaccinate with IIV4 or RIV4.
• is a close contact for a severely immunosuppressed person who requires a protected environment
•
Precautions for use of all influenza vaccines
• Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever
• History of Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination
•
Precautions for use of ccIIV4 and RIV4
• History of a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of any egg-based 
IIV, LAIV, or RIV is a precaution to use of ccIIV4.
• History of a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of any egg-based IIV, 
ccIIV, or LAIV is a precaution to use of RIV4.
Influenza vaccine contraindications and precautions for persons with a history of serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction

‡For complete instructions on how to administer influenza vaccine, see “How to Administer Intramuscular and Intranasal Influenza Vaccines” at
www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2024.pdf . 
§ Adults age 65 and older should receive an adjuvanted (aIIV4) or higher dose (IIV4-HD or IV4) influenza vaccine. If none is available, any age- 
appropriate influenza vaccine may be used.
¶ Data on immune response or side effects (reactogenicity) are limited for coadministration of influenza and other vaccines. Available data 
suggest no significant differences in immune response or reactogenicity when coadministering COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Available data 
are mixed on the immune response to influenza vaccination when coadministered with RSV vaccine. Simultaneous administraton of two or more 
vaccines with adjuvants (aIIV, Heplisav-B, RSV vaccines, Shingrix, Tdap, PCV) may increase the side effects experienced by the patient. When 
deciding whether to coadminister an influenza vaccine with an RSV vaccine or to coadminister an adjuvanted influenza vaccine with other 
adjuvanted vaccines, providers should consider the feasibility of the patient returning for additional vaccine doses, risk for acquiring vaccine-
preventable disease, vaccine reactogenicity profiles, and patient preferences. *Vaccines provided via 317

Adult Polio 
JULY 2023 
 Polio Vaccination for Adults 
Purpose: To reduce morbidity and mortality from poliomyelitis by vaccinating all persons 
who meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) product labeling. 
Policy: Under these standing orders, eligible nurses and other health care professionals 
working within their scope of practice may vaccinate patients who meet the criteria below. 
Procedure: 
1.
Identify persons ≥18 years of age in need of vaccination against poliovirus based on the
following criteria:
•
Routine poliovirus vaccination of adults in the United States is not
necessary. Most adults have a minimal risk for exposure to polioviruses
and are immune as a result of childhood vaccination. Vaccination is
recommended for certain adults who are at greater risk for exposure to
polioviruses than the general population, including the following:
•
Travelers who are going to countries where polio is epidemic or endemic (For
additional information, see Polio: For Travelers).
•
Laboratory and healthcare workers who handle specimens that might contain
polioviruses.
•
Healthcare workers or other caregivers who have close contact with a person who
could be infected with poliovirus.
•
Unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated adults whose children will be receiving oral
poliovirus vaccine (for example, international adoptees or refugees).
•
Unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated adults living or working in a community
where poliovirus is circulating.
Note: *Receipt of the primary series of IPV may be assumed unless there is a 
reason to believe otherwise (e.g., childhood spent in a developing country, 
childhood immunizations not received, etc.) 
2.
Screen all patients for contraindications and precautions to inactivated polio vaccine (IPV):
Contraindications:
•
A history of a serious reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of IPV or to
a vaccine component (to include neomycin, streptomycin, or polymyxin B)
•
For information on vaccine components, refer to the manufacturer’s package insert
or go to
http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf
Precautions: 
•
Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever
•
Syncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable
vaccines. Procedures should be in place to avoid a falling injury (e.g. 15 minute
observation after administration)
3. Provide all patients (or their parent/legal representative) with a copy of the most current
federal Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). You must document, in the patient’s
medical record, the publication date of the VIS and the date it was given to the patient
(parent/legal representative). Provide non-English speaking patients with a copy of the
VIS in their native language, if available and preferred.
          177
Adult Polio 
JULY 2023 
4. Provide IPV as follows:
•
Unvaccinated adults: a 3-dose series (0, 1-2 and 6-12 months)
o
Administer 0.5mL intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle for adults
•
Adults who are incompletely vaccinated (previously received one or two doses of either IPV
or tOPV) and who are at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus administer the remaining
doses of IPV to complete the three-dose series at the recommended interval:
o
If the adult has received Dose 1, and
•
It has been ≥4 weeks since Dose 1, then give Dose 2 today. Dose 3
(final) should be given at least 6 months after Dose 2.
•
It has been <4 weeks since Dose 1, then wait to give Dose 2 at least
4 weeks after Dose 1.
o
If the adult has received Dose 2 and
•
It has been ≥6 months since Dose 2, then give Final Dose 3 today.
This will complete the person’s primary polio vaccination series.
•
It has been <6 months since Dose 2, then wait to give Final Dose 3 at
least 6 months after Dose 2.
•
Adults who have had three or more doses of polio vaccine in the past and are at increased
risk – of exposure to poliovirus may get one lifetime booster dose of IPV.
•
In some circumstances, when there is not enough time to give three doses of IPV according
to the above recommended intervals, then an accelerated schedule can be used:
o
If protection is needed in ≥8 weeks, three doses of IPV can be administered at least 4
weeks apart (e.g., at weeks 0, 4, and 8).
o
If protection is needed in ≥4 but <8 weeks, two doses of IPV should be administered
at least 4 weeks apart (e.g., at weeks 0 and 4).
o
If protection is needed in fewer than 4 weeks, a single dose of IPV should be
administered.
•

anatomical location of administration, lot number, manufacturer, Vaccine Information 
Sheet (VIS) date, and the identification of the person administering the vaccine. If 
vaccine was not given, record the reason for non-receipt. 
6. Be prepared to manage a medical emergency related to the administration of vaccines
by having a written emergency medical protocol available, as well as equipment and
medications.
7. Adverse events occurring after administration of any vaccine should be reported to the
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Reports can be submitted to

Be Prepared to Manage Medical Emergencies 
• 
Vaccine providers should be familiar with identifying immediate allergic reactions, including 
anaphylaxis, and be prepared to treat these events 
at the time of vaccine administration. 
o 
Providers should also have a plan in place to contact emergency medical services 
immediately in the event of a severe acute vaccine reaction. 
o 
Because anaphylaxis may recur after patients begin to recover, monitoring in a 
medical facility for several hours is advised, even after complete resolution of 
symptoms and signs. 
 
Report Adverse Events to VAERS 
— Vaccination providers are responsible for MANDATORY reporting of the following listed events following 
JYNNEOS vaccination to VAERS: 
o 
Vaccine administration errors whether or not associated with an adverse event 
o 
Serious adverse events (irrespective of attribution to vaccination) 
o 
Cases of cardiac events including myocarditis and pericarditis 
o

JULY 2023 
 
 
STANDING ORDERS FOR 
Administering Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine to Children and Teens 
Purpose 
To reduce morbidity and mortality from measles, mumps, and rubella by vaccinating all children 
and teens who meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. 
 
Policy  
 
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses and other healthcare 
professionals (e.g., pharmacists) to assess the need for vaccination and to vaccinate children 
and teens who meet any of the criteria below. 
 
Procedure 
 
1.  Assess Children and Teens for Need of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) 
Vaccination based on the following criteria: 
• Age 12 months or older with no documentation of MMR vaccine 
• Age 4 years or older with no documentation of two doses of MMR vaccine 
• Age 6 months or older with pending international travel 
• Age 12 months or older with documentation of only 1 dose of MMR vaccine given when 
younger than age 12 months 
• History of two previous doses of MMR and identified by public health as being at 
increased risk during a mumps outbreak 
2. Screen for Contraindications and 
Precautions Contraindications 
• Do not give MMR vaccine to a child or teen who has experienced a severe allergic 
reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of MMR vaccine or to any of its 
components. For a list of vaccine components, refer to the manufacturer’s package 
insert (www.immunize.org/packageinserts) or go to www.cdc.gov/ 
vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf. 
• Do not give MMR vaccine to a child or teen who is pregnant or may become pregnant 
within 1 month (pregnant teens should be vaccinated upon completion or termination 
of pregnancy). 
• Do not give MMR vaccine to a child or teen having known severe immunodeficiency 
(e.g., from hematologic and solid tumors, receipt of chemotherapy, congenital 
immunodeficiency, long-term immunosuppressive therapy). 
• Do not give MMR vaccine to a child or teen receiving prolonged (14 days or longer) high- 
dose steroid therapy (20 mg daily or 2 mg/kg body weight of prednisone or its 
equivalent), or severely immunocompromised from HIV infection. (HIV infection is not a 
contraindication to MMR for those children and teens who are not severely 
immunocompromised [i.e., CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts greater than or equal to 200 cells 
per microliter for 6 months or more]. For additional information regarding HIV 
laboratory parameters and use of live vaccines, see the General Best Practice 
Guidelines for Immunization, “Altered Immunocompetence,” at 
www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/immunocompetence.html and 
Table 4-1 (footnote J) at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general- 
recs/contraindications.html.) 
          186
Immunization-MMR (Child) 
JULY 2023 
 
 
• Do not give MMR vaccine to a child or teen with a family history of congenital or hereditary 
immuno- deficiency in first-degree relatives (e.g., parents, siblings) unless the immune 
competence of the potential vaccine recipient has been clinically substantiated or verified 
by a laboratory. 
 
 
Precautions (require evaluation before vaccination) 
• Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever 
• History of recent (within the past 11 months) receipt of antibody-containing blood product 
(specific interval depends on product) 
• Need for tuberculin skin testing (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) testing. If active 
tuberculosis is suspected, MMR should be delayed. Measles vaccination might suppress tuberculin 
reactivity temporarily. The TST should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, 
or at least 4–6 weeks after the measles-containing vaccine (e.g., MMR, MMRV). 
 
3. Provide Vaccine Information Statements 
Provide all patients with a copy of the most current federal Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). 
Provide non-English speaking patients with a copy of the VIS in their native language, if one is 
available and desired; these can be found at www.immunize.org/vis. (For information about how to 
document that the VIS was given, see section 6 titled “Document Vaccination.”) 
4. Prepare to Administer Vaccine 
MMR II (Merck) may be administered via either the intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (Subcut) route; Priorix (GSK) 
may only be administered by the Subcut route.

STANDING ORDERS  FOR 
Administering 
Measles, Mumps,  and Rubella  Vaccine to Adults 
 
Purpose 
To reduce morbidity and mortality from measles, mumps, and rubella disease by 
vaccinating all adults who meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. 
 
Policy  
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses and other healthcare 
professionals (e.g., pharmacists) to assess the need for vaccination and to vaccinate adults who 
meet any of the criteria below. 
 
Procedure 
1. Assess Adults for Need of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccination 
a. Identify adults in need of initial MMR vaccination who 
• were born in the U.S. in 1957 or later, or 
• are a healthcare worker of any age, and who do not meet evidence of immunity by 
having met any of the following criteria: 
• Documentation of receiving at least 1 dose of MMR vaccine 
• Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease to 
measles, mumps, and rubella 
b. Identify adults in need of a second dose of MMR vaccine who 
• were born U.S. in 1957 or later and are planning to travel internationally, 
• are a student in a college, university, technical, or vocational school, or 
• are a healthcare worker born in 1957 or later 
c. Identify adults who have been recommended to receive an additional dose of MMR 
because of their increased risk for mumps during a current mumps outbreak 
(resulting in either 2 or 3 total doses) 
2. Screen for Contraindications and 
Precautions Contraindications 
• Do not give MMR vaccine to a person who has experienced a severe allergic reaction 
(e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of MMR vaccine or to any of its components. 
For a list of vaccine components, refer to the manufacturer’s package insert 
(www.immunize.org/packageinserts) or go to www.cdc.gov/ 
vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf. 
• Do not give MMR vaccine to a woman who is pregnant or may become pregnant within 
1 month (pregnant women should be vaccinated upon completion or termination of 
pregnancy). 
• Do not give MMR vaccine to a person having known severe immunodeficiency (e.g., 
from hematologic and solid tumors, receipt of chemotherapy, congenital 
immunodeficiency, long-term immunosuppressive therapy). 
          190
Immunizations, MMR (Adult) 
JULY 2023 
 
 
• Do not give MMR vaccine to a person receiving high-dose systemic immunosuppressive 
therapy (e.g., two weeks or more of daily receipt of 20 mg or more [or 2 mg/kg body 
weight or more] of prednisone or equivalent). 
Note: Susceptible individuals living with HIV are at increased risk for serious illness if infected with measles. HIV+ adults who are 
not severely immunocompromised should receive MMR vaccine as recommended. For additional information regarding HIV 
laboratory parameters and use of live vaccines, see the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, “Altered 
Immunocompetence,” at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/immunocompetence.html and Table 4-1 (footnote J) 
at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/contraindications.html. 
• Do not give MMR vaccine to an adult with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and 
CD4+ T-lymphocytes count <200 cells/µL. (HIV infection is not a contraindication to MMR for 
adults who are not severely immunocompromised [i.e., CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts >200 
cells/µL for 6 months or more.]) In circumstances where only counts or only percentages are 
available on the lab report, assessment can be based on the laboratory measure that is 
available (i.e., counts or percentages). 
Precautions 
• Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever 
• History of recent (within the past 11 months) receipt of antibody-containing blood product 
(specific interval depends on product) 
• History of thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopenic purpura 
• Need for tuberculin skin testing or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) testing. If active 
tuberculosis is suspected, MMR should be delayed. Measles vaccination might suppress 
tuberculin reactivity temporarily. Measles-containing vaccine can be administered on the same 
day as tuberculin skin testing, or should be postponed for at least 4 weeks after the vaccination.

Immunization-ProQuad 
JULY 2023 
 
 
Do not administer ProQuad to individuals who are pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant in the next 3 
monthsProvide Vaccine Information Statements 
 
Provide all patients with a copy of the most current federal Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). Provide non-English 
speaking patients with a copy of the VIS in their native language, if one is available and desired; these can be found at 
www.immunize.org/vis. (For information about how to document that the VIS was given, see section 6 titled “Document 
Vaccination.”) 
 
Indications and Usage 
 
• 
MMRV vaccine is a combination vaccine indicated for active immunization for the 
prevention of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in children aged 12 
months through 12 years. 
o 
ACIP recommends that MMR vaccine AND varicella vaccines be 
administered separately for the first dose in children aged 12 through 47 
months due to the increased risk for febrile seizures with the MMRV 
combination vaccine. 
o 
 For the second dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at 
any age (i.e., 15 months through 12 years) and for the first dose in children 
aged 48 months through 12 years, use of the MMRV vaccine is generally 
preferred over separate injections of its equivalent component vaccines (i.e., 
MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine). 
 
 
Recommended Schedule for Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella Vaccines 
• 
The recommended ages for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccination 
continue to be age 12 through 15 months for the first dose and age 4 through 6 years 
for the second dose. 
o 
FIRST DOSE of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines 
 
should be administered to children aged 12 months through 47 
months, providers may use either MMR vaccine and varicella 
vaccine or MMRV vaccine. Providers who are considering 
administering MMRV vaccine should discuss the benefits and 
risks of both vaccination options with the parents or 
caregivers. Unless the parent or caregiver expresses a 
preference for MMRV vaccine, CDC recommends that 
providers administer MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine for 
the first dose in this age group. 
 
For the first dose administered to children aged 48 months through 
12 years, use of MMRV vaccine is generally preferred over 
separate injections of its equivalent component vaccines (i.e., 
MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine). 
o 
SECOND DOSE of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines 
 
For the second dose administered to children aged 15 months through 
12 years, use of MMRV vaccine is generally preferred over separate 
injections of its equivalent component vaccines (i.e., MMR vaccine 
and varicella vaccine). 
 
At least one month should lapse between a dose of measles- 
containing vaccine, such as MMR vaccine, and a dose of MMRV 
vaccine. If for any reason a second dose of varicella-containing 
vaccine is required, at least 3 months should lapse between 
administrations of the two doses. 
Dosage and Route 
 
 
Administer 0.5 mL subcutaneously or intramuscularly 
 
MMRV vaccine is supplied in single-dose vials of lyophilized vaccine to be reconstituted 
using only the separately packaged supplied diluent. Withdraw the entire volume of 
supplied diluent into a syringe. Inject the entire content of the syringe into the vial 
containing the powder. Gently agitate to dissolve completely. Withdraw the entire 
amount of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into the same syringe and inject the 
entire volume immediately after reconstitution. Discard reconstituted vaccine if not 
used within 30 minutes.

**Preferred site 
 
Penbraya (MenABCWY) is supplied in a kit that includes a vial of Lyophilized MenACWY Component (a 
sterile white powder), a prefilled syringe containing the MenB Component and a vial adapter. 
To form PENBRAYA (MenABCWY), reconstitute the Lyophilized MenACWY Component with the MenB 
Component as directed below: (see labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=19937#S11) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunization-MEN ABCWY (Teen, Adult)

Step 1. Preparation of vial and vial adapter 
 Remove plastic flip-off cap from vial containing the Lyophilized MenACWY 
Component. 
 Cleanse the rubber stopper. 
 Without removing the vial adapter from its packaging, peel off the top 
cover. 
 
Step 2. Attachment of vial adapter 
 Hold the base of the vial on a flat surface. 
 Keep the vial adapter in the packaging and orient it vertically over the 
center of the vial so that the adapter spike aligns with the center of the 
vial’s rubber stopper. 
 Connect the vial adapter to the vial with a straight downward push. The 
vial adapter will lock into place. 
 Do not push vial adapter in at an angle as this may result in leaking during 
use. 
 Remove the vial adapter packaging. 
Step 3. Resuspension of the MenB Component 
 Shake the syringe vigorously to obtain a white homogenous suspension. 
Do not use if the contents cannot be resuspended. 
Step 4. Removal of syringe cap 
 For all syringe assembly steps, hold the syringe only by the Luer lock 
adapter located at the tip of the syringe. This will prevent the Luer lock 
adapter from detaching during use. 
 Remove the syringe cap by slowly turning the cap counter-clockwise while 
holding the Luer lock adapter. 
 
Step 5. Connection of syringe to vial adapter 
 Hold the syringe’s Luer lock adapter and connect it to the vial adapter by 
turning clockwise. 
 Stop turning when you feel resistance, overtightening the syringe may 
result in leaking during use. 
 Once the syringe is securely attached to the vial adapter, there will be a 
small space between the top of the vial adapter and the Luer lock adapter 
of the syringe. 
 
Step 6. Reconstitution of Lyophilized MenACWY Component with MenB 
Component to form PENBRAYA 
 Inject the entire contents of the syringe containing the MenB Component 
into the vial. 
 Do not remove the empty syringe. 
 While holding the plunger rod down, gently swirl the vial in a circular 
motion until the powder is completely dissolved (less than 1 minute). 
Step 7. Withdrawal of PENBRAYA 
 Invert the vial completely with the vial adapter and syringe still attached. 
 Slowly withdraw the entire contents into the syringe to ensure an 
approximately 0.5 mL dose of PENBRAYA for administration. 
 Do not pull the plunger rod out. 
Step 8. Disconnection of syringe 
 Hold the Luer lock adapter of the syringe and disconnect the syringe from 
the vial adapter by turning counter-clockwise.

2. Administer MenABCWY vaccine*, approximately 0.5 mL, via the intramuscular (IM) route,  
(After reconstitution, administer PENBRAYA immediately or store between 2°C and 30°C (36°F and 86°F) and use within 4 
hours. Discard reconstituted vaccine if not used within 4 hours.) 
*NOTE: As stated previously, people must get the same vaccine brand for all doses of MenB vaccine. If a patient 
receives MenABCWY vaccine, which includes the MenB vaccine Trumenba®, then administer Trumenba® for 
their additional MenB dose(s). 
 
 
Adolescents and adults with certain medical conditions and risk factors** may get more than one dose of  
MenABCWY vaccine. 
If a patient is receiving MenACWY and MenB vaccines at the same visit, MenABCWY may be given instead. 
If a patient receives MenABCWY vaccine, which includes Trumenba®, then administer: 
• 
Trumenba® for additional MenB dose(s) when MenACWY isn’t indicated 
• 
Any MenACWY vaccine when MenB isn’t indicated 
 
The minimum interval between MenABCWY doses is 6 months. 
People with prolonged increased risk for serogroup A, C, W, or Y and B meningococcal disease need regular boosters.  
Booster doses should be given:  
For MenACWY: Single dose at 5 years after primary vaccination and every 5 years thereafter 
For MenB: Single dose at 1 year after completion of primary vaccination and every 2–3 years thereafter. 
**Medical conditions and risk factors (for more details, visit Meningococcal Vaccination: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices, United States, 2020 | MMWR (cdc.gov): 
 
Persons with persistent complement component deficiencies. 
 
Persons who use complement inhibitors 
 
Persons with anatomic or functional asplenia 
 
Microbiologists routinely exposed to N. meningitidis isolates 
 
Persons at increased risk during an outbreak of meningococcal disease 
 
           3.   Document Vaccination 
    Document each patient’s vaccine administration information and follow-up in the following places:  
Medical record: Record the date the vaccine was administered, the manufacturer and lot number, the 
vaccination site and route, and the name and title of the person administering the vaccine. You must 
also document, in the patient’s medical record or office log, the publication date of the VIS and the 
date it was given to the patient. Note that medical records/charts should be documented and retained 
in accordance with applicable state laws and regulations. If vaccine was not administered, record 
the reason(s) for non-receipt of the vaccine (e.g., medical contraindication, patient refusal); discuss 
the need for vaccination with any high-risk patient who refuses vaccination at the next visit. 
Personal immunization record card (if applicable): Record the date of vaccination and the 
name/location of the administering clinic. 
Immunization Information System (IIS) or “registry”: Report the vaccination to the appropriate 
state/local IIS, if available. 
 
Step 9. Attachment of needle 
 Attach a sterile needle suitable for intramuscular injection to the syringe 
containing PENBRAYA. 
 
Step 10. Visual inspection 
 PENBRAYA is a homogeneous white suspension. If the vaccine is not a 
homogenous suspension, shake to resuspend prior to administration. 
 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate 
matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and 
container permit.  
 Discard if either condition is present.

Medical record: Record the date the vaccine was administered, the manufacturer and lot number, 
the vaccination site and route, and the name and title of the person administering the vaccine. You 
must also document, in the patient’s medical record or office log, the publication date of the VIS and 
the date it was given to the patient. Note that medical records/charts should be documented and 
retained in accordance with applicable state laws and regulations. If vaccine was not administered, 
record the reason(s) for non-receipt of the vaccine (e.g., medical contraindication, patient refusal). 
Discuss the need for vaccine with the patient (or, in the case of a minor, their parent or legal 
representative) at the next visit. 
Personal immunization record card: Record the date of vaccination and the name/location of the 
administering clinic. 
Immunization Information System (IIS) or “registry”: Report the vaccination to the appropriate 
state/local IIS, if available. 
 
 
7. Be Prepared to Manage Medical Emergencies 
Be prepared for management of a medical emergency related to the administration of vaccine by 
having a written emergency medical protocol available, as well as equipment and medications. For 
IAC’s “Medical Management of Vaccine Reactions in Children and Teens,” go to 
www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3082a.pdf. For “Medical Management of Vaccine Reactions in Adult 
Patients,” go to www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3082.pdf. To prevent syncope, vaccinate patients while 
they are seated or lying down and consider observing them for 15 minutes after receipt of the 
vaccine.

Administering Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine to Children 
 
Purpose 
To reduce morbidity and mortality from invasive pneumococcal disease by vaccinating all infants and 
children who meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). 
 
Policy 
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses and other healthcare professionals 
(e.g., pharmacists) to assess the need for and vaccinate children and teens who meet any of the criteria 
below. 
Procedure 
1. Assess Infants and Children in Need of Vaccination against invasive pneumococcal disease based 
on the following criteria: 
Routine pneumococcal vaccination 
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either PCV15 or PCV20) should be administered routinely to all 
children ages 2 through 23 months. For children with an incomplete PCV vaccination status, use 
of either PCV15 or PCV20 according to currently recommended PCV dosing and schedules is 
recommended for: 
• 
Healthy children aged 24–59 months 
• 
Children with specified health conditions* aged 24 through 71 months 
For children aged 2–18 years with any risk condition who have received all recommended doses 
of PCV before age 6 years 
• 
Using ≥1 dose(s) of PCV20: No additional doses of any pneumococcal vaccine are indicated. This 
recommendation may be updated as additional data become available. 
• 
Using PCV13 or PCV15 (no PCV20): A dose of PCV20 or PPSV23** using previously recommended 
dosing and schedules is recommended. 
For children aged 6–18 years with any risk condition who have not received any dose of PCV13, PCV15, 
or PCV20, a single dose of PCV15 or PCV20 is recommended. When PCV15 is used, it should be 
followed by a dose of PPSV23** at least 8 weeks later if not previously given. 
* Risk conditions include: cerebrospinal fluid leak; chronic heart disease; chronic kidney disease 
(excluding maintenance dialysis and nephrotic syndrome, which are included in immunocompromising 
conditions); chronic liver disease; chronic lung disease (including moderate persistent or severe persistent 
asthma); cochlear implant; diabetes mellitus; immunocompromising conditions (on maintenance dialysis or 
with nephrotic syndrome; congenital or acquired asplenia or splenic dysfunction; congenital or acquired 
immunodeficiencies; diseases and conditions treated with immunosuppressive drugs or radiation therapy, 
including malignant neoplasms, leukemias, lymphomas, Hodgkin disease, and solid organ transplant; HIV 
infection; and sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies). 
** See standing orders for administering pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) to children and 
teens for more information. 
2. Screen for contraindications and precautions 
Contraindications 
• Do not give PCV15 or PCV20 to a child who has experienced a serious reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a 
prior dose of the vaccine or to any of its components (including to any diphtheria toxoid-containing 
vaccine). For information on vaccine components, refer to the manufacturers’ package insert, for PCV15 
visit: https://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/v/vaxneuvance/vaxneuvance_pi.pdf or for PCV20,

3. Provide Vaccine Information Statements 
Provide all patients (or, in the case of minors, their parent, or legal representative) with a copy of the most current federal 
Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). Provide non-English speaking patients with a copy of the VIS in their native 
language, if one is available and desired; these can be found at www.immunize.org/vis. (For information about how to 
document that the VIS was given, see section 6 titled “Document Vaccination.”) 
 
4. Prepare to Administer Vaccine 
Hold the prefilled syringe horizontally and shake vigorously immediately prior to use to obtain an opalescent white 
suspension. Do not use the vaccine if it cannot be resuspended. Parenteral drug products should be inspected 
visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 
Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is observed.

Immunization: RSV Nirsevimab-alip I n f a n t / Child 
October 2, 2023  
 
STANDING ORDERS FOR 
Administering Nirsevimab-alip for RSV Immunization to 
I n f a n t s / Children 
Purpose 
To reduce morbidity and mortality from severe respiratory syncytial virus 
(RSV) lower respiratory tract disease by administering nirsevimab-alip to all 
children who meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices. 
Policy 
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses 
and other healthcare professionals (e.g., pharmacists) to assess 
the need for and vaccinate children who meet any of the criteria 
below. 
Procedure 
 Assess infants and children for the need of nirsevimab-alip 
against respiratory syncytial virus according to the following 
criteria:  
Routine administration of Nirsevimab-alip (Beyfortus) 
•
Neonates and Infants who are younger than 8 months
and born during – or entering – their first RSV season,
including those recommended by the American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to receive palivizumab
(see note).
•
Children between the ages of 8 and 19 months who are
at high risk of severe RSV, such as children who are
severely immunocompromised, and who are entering
their second RSV season, including those
recommended by the AAP to receive palivizumab (see
note).
Note: Babies born to mothers who get RSV vaccine at least 2 weeks before delivery will 
have protection and, in most cases, should not need an RSV immunization with 
nirsevimab-alip. Children who have received nirsevimab-alip should not receive 
palivizumab for the same RSV season. For guidance on nirsevimab-alip versus 
palivizumab, visit: ACIP and AAP Recommendations for Nirsevimab | Red Book Online 
| American Academy of Pediatrics 
Nirsevimab-alip can be administered in most of the continental United States from 
October through the end of March. Infants born shortly before or during the RSV 
season should receive nirsevimab-alip within 1 week of birth. Nirsevimab-alip 
administration can occur during the birth hospitalization or in the outpatient setting. 
Optimal timing for nirsevimab-alip administration is shortly before the RSV season 
begins; however, nirsevimab-alip may be administered to age-eligible infants and 
children who have not yet received a dose at any time during the season. Only a single 
dose of nirsevimab-alip is recommended for an RSV season. Infants with prolonged 
birth hospitalizations related to prematurity or other causes should receive nirsevimab-
alip shortly before or promptly after hospital discharge. Because the timing of the onset, 
peak, and decline of RSV activity might vary geographically, providers can adjust 
Immunization: RSV Nirsevimab-alip I n f a n t / Child 
October 2, 2023  
 
administration schedules based on local epidemiology. 
Screen for contraindications and precautions 
Contraindications 
o
Nirsevmab-alip is contraindicated in infants and children with a
history of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis,
to nirsevimab-alip or to any of the excipients, see Warnings and
Precautions  For information on vaccine components, refer to the
manufacturer’s package insert (beyfortus.pdf (sanofi.us).
Warnings and Precautions 
o
Hypersensitivity Including Anaphylaxis: Serious hypersensitivity reactions,
including
anaphylaxis, have been observed with other human IgG1 monoclonal antibodies.
Initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive therapy.
Patient Counseling Information 
Provide all patients (or, in the case of a minor, their parent or legal representative) with the 
FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information) or with a copy of themost current 
federal Immuniation Information Statement (IIS) once available at  
 https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/rsv/immunization-information-statement.html. You must  
document in the patient’s medical record or office log, the publication date of the IIS and the 
date it was given to the patient (parent/legal representative). If no IIS is available from the 
CDC then document date that the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information) was 
provided. Provide non-English speaking patients with a copy of the FDA-approved patient 
labeling (Patient Information) or the IIS in their native language, if one is available and 
desired; these can be found 
 at  https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/rsv/immunization-information-statement.htm. 
Prepare to Administer Nirsevimab-alip 
Verify proper storage per manufacture package insert. Do not freeze. Do not shake. 
Do not expose to heat. Keep in original carton to protect from light until time of use. 
After removal from the refrigerator, nirsevimab-alip must be used within 8 hours or

To reduce morbidity and mortality from tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis infection by vaccinating all adults 
who meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices. 
Policy 
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses and other healthcare professionals (e.g., 
pharmacists) to assess the need for vaccination and to vaccinate adults who meet any of the criteria below. 
Procedure 
1. Assess Adults for Need of Vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis based on the following
criteria:
• Lack of documentation of ever receiving a dose of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis
vaccine (Tdap) as an adolescent or adult
• Currently pregnant (preferably between 27 and 36 weeks gestation) and no documentation of Tdap
given during current pregnancy
• Lack of documentation of receiving at least 3 doses of tetanus- and diphtheria-containing toxoids
• Completion of a 3-dose primary series of tetanus- and diphtheria-containing toxoids with no
documentation of receiving a booster dose in the previous 10 years
• Recent deep and dirty wound (e.g., contaminated with dirt, feces, saliva) and lack of evidence of having
received tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine in the previous 5 years
2. Screen for Contraindications and Precautions
Contraindications
• Do not give Tdap or Td to a person who has experienced a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction
to a prior dose of either vaccine or to any of its components. For a list of vaccine components, refer to
the manufacturer’s package insert (www.immunize.org/fda) or go to
www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/ appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf.
• Do not give Tdap to a person who has experienced encephalopathy within 7 days following
DTP/DTaP/Tdap not attributable to another identifiable cause.
Precautions 
• History of Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of a previous dose of tetanus toxoid-containing
vaccine
• History of an Arthus-type hypersensitivity reaction after a previous dose of tetanus or diphtheria
toxoid-containing vaccine; in such cases, defer vaccination until at least 10 years have elapsed since
the last tetanus toxoid- containing vaccine
• Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever
• For Tdap only: progressive or unstable neurologic disorder, uncontrolled seizures or progressive
encephalopathy until the patient’s treatment regimen has been established and the condition has
stabilized
3. Provide Vaccine Information Statements
Provide all patients with a copy of the most current federal Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). Provide
non-English speaking patients with a copy of the VIS in their native language, if one is available and
desired; these can be found at www.immunize.org/vis. (For information about how to document that the
VIS was given, see section 6 titled “Document Vaccination.”)

Immunization-Varicella (Child) 
JULY 2023 
STANDING ORDERS FOR 
Administering Varicella Vaccine to Children and Teens 
Purpose 
To reduce morbidity and mortality from varicella disease by vaccinating all children and teens 
who meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices. 
Policy 
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses and other health care 
professionals (e.g., pharmacists) to assess the need for vaccination and to vaccinate children and 
teens who meet any of the criteria below. 
Procedure 
1. Assess Children and Teens for Need of Vaccination against varicella who are age 12
months or older and who have not met any of the following criteria:
•
Documentation of at least two doses of vaccine, both given on or after age 12 months,
separated by at least 4 weeks (Note: the recommended minimum dosing interval for children age
12 months through 12 years is at least 12 weeks, but a documented dose inadvertently administered 
after at least 4 weeks may be counted as valid.) 
•
History of varicella disease based on diagnosis or verification of varicella by a healthcare
provider
•
History of herpes zoster based on a diagnosis or verification of herpes zoster by a healthcare
provider
•
Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease
2. Screen for Contraindications and Precautions
Contraindications 
• Do not give varicella vaccine to a child or teen who has experienced a serious systemic or
anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of vaccine or to any of its components. For a list of
vaccine components, refer to the manufacturer’s package insert
(www.immunize.org/packageinserts) or go to www.cdc.gov/vaccines/
pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf.
ϒ 
Do not give varicella vaccine to a child or teen who is pregnant or may become pregnant 
within 1 month (pregnant teens should be vaccinated upon completion or termination of 
pregnancy).Do not give varicella vaccine to a child or teen with severe 
immunodeficiency (e.g., hematologic and solid tumors, receipt of chemotherapy, 
congenital immunodeficiency, long-term immunosuppressive therapy or patients with 
HIV infection who are severely immunocompromised).Note: Long-term 
immunosuppressive therapy is defined as at least 2 weeks of daily receipt of 20 mg or 2 
mg/kg body weight of prednisone or its equivalent. 
• Note: Susceptible individuals living with HIV infection are at increased risk for serious
illness from varicella infection. Eligible HIV-infected children age 12 months or older
should receive 2 doses of single-component varicella vaccine with a 3-month interval
between doses. For additional information regarding HIV laboratory parameters and use
of live vaccines, see the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, “Altered
Immunocompetence,” at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip- 
recs/generalrecs/immunocompetence.html and Table 4-1 (footnote J) at
www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/ general-recs/contraindications.html.

Immunization-Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV; Shingrix) 
JULY 2023 
 
Purpose 
Standing Order for 
Administering Recombinant Zoster Vaccine to Adults 
•
To reduce morbidity and mortality from herpes zoster (shingles) by vaccinating all adults who meet the criteria
established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP).
Policy 
•
Where allowed by state law, standing orders enable eligible nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare
professionals to assess the need for vaccination and to vaccinate adults who meet any of the criteria below.
Procedure 
•
Assess Adults for Need of Vaccination against herpes zoster based on the following criteria:
o
Adults lacking documentation of ever receiving two doses of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV;
Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline) and who are:

Age 50 years or older and immunocompetent

Age 19 years or older who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to
disease or therapy. For patients in this category, consult medical director and consider
consulting the provider primarily responsible for managing the patient’s
immunocompromising condition or therapy, as needed. Detailed clinical considerations for
vaccination of people who are or will be immunocompromised are available at
www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccination/immunocompromised-adults.html.
o
Notes on history of varicella, herpes zoster, and vaccination:

RZV is not indicated and has not been studied for the prevention of primary infection
with varicella zoster virus (chickenpox). People who have been vaccinated against
varicella are at lower risk of zoster but may benefit from zoster vaccination.

Screening for a history of chickenpox is not required for immunocompetent people born in
the United States before 1980 because more than 99% have serologic evidence of
infection. For immunocompromised adults with no documented history of varicella,
varicella vaccination, or herpes zoster, see
www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccination/immunocompromised-adults.html#special-populations.

A history of herpes zoster or of receiving zoster vaccine live (ZVL; Zostavax, Merck) does
not change the recommendation to receive two doses of RZV.
Screen for Contraindications and Precautions 
•
Contraindications
o
Do not give RZV to a person who has experienced a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction to a
vaccine component. For a list of vaccine components, refer to the manufacturer’s package insert
(see www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/vaccines-licensed-use-united-states ) or go to
www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf.
•
Precautions
o
Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever.
o
If an individual is experiencing an episode of shingles, vaccination should be delayed until the acute stage of
the illness is over, and symptoms abate. RZV is not a treatment for shingles or postherpetic neuralgia.
o
There is currently no ACIPrecommendation for RZV use in pregnancy; consider delaying RZV until after
pregnancy.
o
Breastfeeding is not a precaution to vaccination. Recombinant vaccines such as RZV pose no known risk
to mothers who are breastfeeding or to their infants. Consider vaccination without regard to
breastfeeding status if RZV is otherwise indicated.
          241

Kentucky Administrative Regulation, 902 KAR 2:020, requires all licensed health professionals 
and facilities to report hepatitis B infection in pregnant women to the local or state health 
department. The Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program consists of surveillance, tracking, and 
a reminder/recall program for infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive 
women. 
 
Each local health department (LHD) must designate one person as the Perinatal Hepatitis B 
Prevention Coordinator for case management of these infants. 
 
Screening and Reporting 
• Kentucky Revised Statute 214.160, http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=8792, 
requires that all pregnant women shall be screened for hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAg) during every pregnancy. This testing shall be completed regardless of past test 
results or hepatitis B immunization status. 
• If a woman has a positive HBsAg screening, notification to the local or state health 
department “shall be considered a priority and shall be made within one (1) business day 
per 902 KAR 2.020”, http://www.lrc.ky.gov/kar/902/002/020.htm. 
• If a woman has a positive HBsAg screening, that woman must have further serological 
testing completed for confirmation of infection, unless she is known to have chronic 
hepatitis B infection. 
o CDC recommended additional tests shown in the “Screening and Referral 
Algorithm for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection among Pregnant Women” on 
page 2, to include: hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg, associated with a higher risk of 
infectivity when positive), quantitative HBV DNA concentration, and alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT). Assure that medical providers are aware of CDC 
recommendations for immediate referral of a pregnant woman to a hepatitis 
specialist when results on those additional lab tests are reported as: 
 HBeAg-positive 
 HBV DNA concentration of 20,000 IU/mL or greater 
 ALT of 19 IU/L or greater 
o See Table 1 for correct interpretation of the results of the following serological 
markers that may also be ordered by medical providers: HBsAg, antibody to 
hepatitis B core antigen (total anti-HBc and IgM anti-HBc). 
• Women who present to the delivering hospital with an unknown HBsAg status must have 
lab tests drawn at the time of delivery to determine their HBsAg status. The results must 
be recorded on the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Form for Infants (EPID 399) form 
prior to discharge and sent to the health department in the county of residence of the 
mother, whether located in Kentucky or in another state. 
Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program                 JULY 2023 
• Positive results must be reported in the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System 
(NEDSS) or on a Hepatitis B Infection in Pregnant Women or Child (EPID 394) form. 
Forward all HBsAg-positive results on pregnant women, reported on the EPID 394 form, 
to the Kentucky Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Coordinator by mail or fax, within one 
business day of results being reported: 
 
1) Mail the results to: 
Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Coordinator 
275 East Main Street, HS2E-B 
Frankfort, KY 40621 
 
2) Fax the results to 502-564-4760

Post-vaccination quantitative anti-HBs antibody testing, when it is recommended for other 
persons, should be performed 1 to 2 months following the last dose of the hepatitis B 
vaccine series. 
** 1. May be recovering from acute HBV infection. 
2. May be distantly immune and the test is not sensitive enough to detected a very low 
level of anti-HBs in serum. 
3. May be susceptible with a false positive anti-HBc. 
4. May be chronically infected and have an undetectable level of HBsAg present in the 
serum.

Kentucky Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Coordinator 
• Maintains the Kentucky Perinatal Hepatitis B prevention database. 
• Serves as a resource for the local health departments. 
• Develops templates and educational materials for the local health departments to use in 
case management for the parent and providers. 
 
Local Health Department Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Coordinator 
• Determine pregnancy status on all reports of HBsAg-positive women aged 11 through 
46 years. 
• Follow-up with the reporting provider of an HBsAg-positive pregnant woman to obtain 
more information needed for case management. The Coordinator should ensure that the 
provider is aware of the pregnant woman’s HBsAg-positive status and of the additional 
CDC recommended tests in the “Screening and Referral Algorithm for Hepatitis B Virus 
(HBV) Infection among Pregnant Women”. 
• Complete an EPID 394 form or enter the case information into NEDSS on all 
HBsAg-positive pregnant women. 
• Initiate a case management form (EPID 395 form). 
• Forward a copy of the EPID 394 form to the Kentucky Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention 
Coordinator at the Kentucky Department for Public Health in Frankfort. 
• Contact the HBsAg-positive woman as soon as a case is identified. Provide education 
and counseling about protecting the liver, the prevention of perinatal hepatitis B infection 
for the infant, and protecting others from exposure to the hepatitis B virus. For 
educational materials, visit http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis. A letter may be sent 
(PHBPP-1 form). 
• Determine sexual and household contacts of the HBsAg-positive woman and offer them 
education, testing and/or hepatitis B immunizations. Testing should not unduly delay or 
impede immunization efforts. Document contacts and outcomes in NEDSS or on the 
EPID 395 form. Refer all HBsAg-positive patients to a medical provider to monitor 
outcomes or progress of HBV infection. Document if referral was completed. 
• Send a reminder letter or call mother one month prior to delivery. (PHBPP-2 form) 
• Notify the delivering hospital of the mother’s HBsAg status. (PHBPP-3 form) 
• Once an infant is born to an HBsAg-positive mother, verify that the infant received HBIG 
and hepatitis B vaccine after delivery per the EPID 399 form from the delivering hospital. 
• Review all EPID 399 forms for missing information. All sections of the EPID 399 form 
must be completed. The EPID 399 form should be sent to the local health department in 
the mother’s county of residence for case management, whether located in Kentucky or in 
another state. 
• Contact the hospital if the due date is two weeks past for follow-up. 
Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program                 JULY 2023 
• Notify the infant’s provider for follow-up care, and refer them to the American Academy 
of Pediatrics recommendations in the 2015 Red Book for Post Exposure Management of 
Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers and to the 2015 “Update: Shortened Interval for 
Postvaccination Serologic Testing of Infants Born to Hepatitis B-Infected Mothers,” 
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6439a6.htm?s_cid=mm6439a6_w 
from CDC. A case management form can be sent to this provider. (PHBPP 4, and 
PHBPP-5 forms). 
• Ensure the infant, born to an HBsAg-positive mother, receives three or more doses of the 
hepatitis B vaccine series and postvaccination serological testing (PVST). Send reminder 
letters and/ or make phone calls to the mother and the provider two to four weeks prior to 
each vaccination dose and for serology testing due dates (PHBPP-6, PHBPP-7, and 
PHBPP-8 forms). 
• HBsAg negative infants with anti-HBs less than 10 mIU/mL should be revaccinated with 
a single dose of HepB vaccine and receive PVST one to two months later. Infants whose 
anti-HBs remains less than 10 mIU/mL following single dose revaccination should 
receive two additional doses of HepB vaccine, followed by PVST one to two months 
after the final dose. 
o Based on clinical circumstances or family preference, HBsAg-negative infants 
with anti-HBs less than 10 mIU/mL may instead be revaccinated with a second, 
complete 3-dose series, followed by PVST performed one to two months after the 
final dose of vaccine. 
• Send a final letter to mother with dates immunizations were received and results of PVST 
for the infant’s immunization record. (PHBPP-9 form) 
• Case is closed if the results of PVST indicate that the infant is HBsAg-negative and 
anti-HBs-positive. The results must be attached to the final printout. 
• If infant is HBsAg-positive, results must be reported to the local health department or 
KDPH within one business day of the report of a positive result in accordance with 
902 KAR 2:020. 
• Send updates by the 15th of each month to the Kentucky Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention 
Coordinator by mail or fax. 
o Mail the updates and lab results to:

HBsAg-positive women identified at or after delivery 
In some cases, HBV infection is detected at the time of delivery of the infant. In this case, 
the delivery hospital should contact the LHD of the county of residence for the infant, and 
complete the EPID 399 form. 
 
The LHD Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Coordinator shall confirm that the infant has 
received Hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG. HBIG should be given as soon as possible ideally 
within 12 hours of birth, but within seven days of birth, at a separate anatomical site from the 
hepatitis B vaccine, ideally in a separate limb. The LHD Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention 
Coordinator then begins case management for infants born to an HBsAg-positive woman.

Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program                 JULY 2023 
Managing Missed Vaccination/ Serology Appointment 
• Send a reminder card for missed appointments. 
• Send a letter, conduct home visit and/or make a telephone call to the parent or guardian. 
• Send a certified letter for continued non-compliance. If there is no response to that letter, 
the infant is considered lost to follow-up. 
• Send updates to the Kentucky Perinatal Hepatitis B Coordinator by the 15th of each 
month. 
Lost to Follow-up 
In the nine to 18 months that it takes to complete the newborn case management, some 
patients will move without providing the LHD with new contact information. To find 
patients, LHDs may use Women Infants and Children (WIC) and Medicaid databases to 
locate updated demographics. Additional tips for locating these patients can include: 
 
• Call telephone information (411) 
• Internet search engines (e.g., Google or white pages) 
• Directories that list occupants of each household; most STD programs have directories 
like this. 
• Old phone numbers listed in patient paperwork. Sometimes relatives or friends may still 
be at that number. 
• Transpose the digits of telephone numbers and addresses. 
• Search older health department records. 
 
A patient can be classified as “lost to follow-up” and the file closed once the following 
conditions are met and the Kentucky Perinatal Hepatitis B Coordinator believes further 
investigation would be fruitless. Examples include: 
 
• Failed phone contact after three calls. 
• Failed home visit. 
• Failed mail deliveries including returned certified letters. 
• Parent refuses to participate in case management with the Perinatal Hepatitis B 
Prevention Program. 
 
Document all attempts to find infants and their parents. If an infant is lost to follow-up and the 
infant is later located, the case should be reopened and follow-up continued from that point. 
Consult the Kentucky Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Coordinator for assistance.

Overview 
Laboratory tests may involve the testing of clinical and environmental specimens. Specimen types may 
include body fluids (plasma, serum, whole blood, urine, etc.) tissues, secretions, culture isolates, animal 
heads, food, milk, and water sources. Laboratory tests provide the Local Health Departments (LHD), clinicians 
and health care providers with indicators to possible health problems and to public health concerns from 
human, animal, and environmental exposures. Information from lab tests can help to identify changes in 
health condition and diagnose and track diseases or conditions. They can help guide decisions in 
treatment for a disease or condition, trigger mitigation to ensure safe food and water consumption and 
usage, evaluate treatment response, and help to monitor diseases, outbreaks, and pandemics in real 
time and over time. 
Laboratory tests usually have a reference range or value(s) of what is considered normal. Such ranges or 
values are usually based upon the testing results from healthy people and incorporate factors such as 
age, gender, ethnicity, geography, season, and other variables. Laboratory ranges and values may vary 
slightly from lab to lab for the same test due to differences in the method of the test, equipment used in 
the testing, and the population of people tested to establish the range. 
Many national public health organizations and authorities such as the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), American Diabetes Association (ADA), National Lipid Association, and the National 
Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) have provided national laboratory references and values to help 
guide health care providers and professionals. Programs within the Kentucky Department for Public 
Health (KDPH), the state’s public heath reference laboratory; Division of Laboratory Services (DLS), and 
this CSG help to provide guidance to LHDs and health care providers in their efforts to improve the lives 
of the citizens and visitors of the Commonwealth through prevention of negative health outcomes, 
promotion of healthy lifestyles and by providing protection from diseases, injuries, and environmental 
health impacts.

CLIA Certificate for PPM 
A CLIA Certificate for Provider-Performed Microscopy (PPM) procedures allows physicians midlevel 
practitioners (nurse midwife, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant), and dentists to perform a limited 
list of moderate complexity microscopic tests. The limited set of microscopic evaluations listed in the 
CLIA regulations are performed on samples such as urine, Vaginal excretions, and skin scrapings. 
 
PPM-certified sites and laboratories must meet the same CLIA quality standards as laboratories 
performing moderate complexity tests. The CLIA requirements for testing under a Certificate for PPM are 
in 42 CFR 493.19 found at Code of Federal Regulations (govinfo.gov).

General Laboratory Testing Recommendations 
 
• 
Follow the most recent package insert of manufacturer's instructions. Kit instructions may change 
slightly from lot to lot. Date the insert with the date the shipment was received/reviewed as 
documentation and to track reviews. 
• 
Any instruction or procedural changes must be reflected in the procedure. Director/Site coordinator 
and staff must read and resign the revised procedure with changes and trained as applicable if 
the changes are major, such as a change in timing, results, or a procedural step. 
• 
Use the test kits/reagents in the form they are received. For example, do not alter reagent strips 
by cutting them in order to test more samples per strip. 
• 
Never use outdated reagents. Check expiration dates on all kits, reagents, and Quality control (QC) 
materials 
• 
Perform quality control and/or calibration as specified by the kit manufacturer. Maintain the QC 
and calibration documentation for at least two years. 
• 
Store and handle all test kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
• 
Maintain safety and laboratory equipment checks and maintenance logs. Perform on schedule per 
regulatory and manufacturer’s requirements and recommendations 
• 
Follow all OSHA regulations that pertain to laboratory testing (e.g., Bloodborne Pathogens 
regulations). 
• 
Review reference lab specimen referral criteria. Confirm specimen collection requirements and 
follow up all testing results. Obtain a copy of the current CLIA and other testing certificates from all 
reference laboratories the LHD uses for testing referrals. These certifications are documentation 
that the laboratories performing the referral testing is an approved and certified laboratory for the 
tests that are being performed by them. 
• 
Send specimens for confirmatory testing when required by the manufacturer. For example, rapid 
group A strep kits may require a throat culture if the patient’s test result is negative. 
• 
Maintain all proficiency testing records and remedial actions documentation for at least 2 years. 
See the CSG “Forms and Teaching Sheets” Lab Section and the tools and resources from the CDC: Tools and

     JULY 2023 
 
Lead Levels and Definitions 
The amount of lead in blood is referred to as the blood lead level is measured in micrograms of lead per 
deciliter of blood. No safe lead level in children has been identified. In 2021, the CDC revised the 
language and utilizes the term “blood lead reference value” (BLRV), which is used to identify children with 
higher levels of lead in their blood compared to most children. The BLRV is based on the 97.5th 
percentile of the blood lead values among U.S. children ages 1-5 years from 2015-2016 and 2017-2018 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles. The Federal Advisory Committee, 
called the Lead Exposure and Prevention Advisory Committee, unanimously voted in 2021 in favor of 
recommending that CDC update the reference value to 3.5 μg/dL based on these NHANES data. The 
CDC revised the BLRV to 3.5 μg/dL. An elevated blood lead level (EBLL) is defined at a blood lead 
level (BLL) greater or equal (>) to 3.5 μg/dL. 
 
Verbal Risk Assessment and Screening Guidelines 
Any child or pregnant woman having a positive risk factor but not having an EBLL must be provided 
preventive lead education to prevent future exposures. 
• 
Medicaid Enrolled Children: Children under 72 months of age who are enrolled in Medicaid are 
considered high risk for lead exposure and must be assessed for lead exposure. A blood lead test 
should be performed for any “Yes” or “I don’t know” responses. 
o 
The Lead Poisoning Verbal Risk Assessment should be completed at 6, 9, and 18 months. 
o 
The Lead Poisoning Verbal Risk Assessment should be completed at age 3 through 6 if the child 
was not previously screened or experienced a change in risk status. 
o 
All children enrolled in Medicaid, regardless of whether coverage is funded through title XIX or 
XXI, are required to receive blood lead screening tests at ages 12 months and 24 months. 
o 
In addition, any child between 24 and 72 months with no record of a previous blood lead 
screening test must receive one. 
o 
Completion of a risk assessment questionnaire does not meet the Medicaid requirement. The 
Medicaid requirement is met only when the two blood lead screening tests identified above (or a 
catch-up blood lead screening test) are conducted. 
• 
Non-Medicaid Enrolled Children: Children under 72 months of age who are not enrolled in 
Medicaid must be assessed for lead exposure. A blood lead test should be performed for any “Yes” or 
“I don’t know” responses. 
o 
The Lead Poisoning Verbal Risk Assessment should be completed at 6, 9, 12, and 18 months, 
and again at 2 years. 
o 
The Lead Poisoning Verbal Risk Assessment should be completed at ages 3 through 6 if the child 
was not previously screened or experienced a change in risk status. 
• 
Refugee Children: The CDC recommends blood lead testing for all refugee children who are 6 
months to 16 years of age upon entering the United States. Repeated blood lead level testing of all 
refugee children who are 6 months to 6 years of age at 3 to 6 months after they are placed in 
permanent residences should be considered a “medical necessity,” regardless of initial test results. 
Resources are available in the resource section of this document. 
• 
Pregnant Women: (See also the Prenatal Section for Lead Screening Guidelines/ Follow-Up). Use 
the verbal risk assessment to assess a pregnant woman’s risk for lead exposure during their first 
prenatal visit. Any “Yes” or “I don’t know” responses result in a blood lead test. Document in the 
medical record at the positive pregnancy test/initial prenatal visit and anytime that the assessment 
was done, any positive response(s), and action taken according to the class chart guidelines located 
in the Prenatal section. 
 
Blood Lead Specimen Collection 
All LHD staff obtaining blood lead specimens must click the link CDC Blood Lead Collection Guidelines to 
view the video and documents as indicated in the Training Requirements: Administrative Reference 
(AR)/Training Guidelines and Program Descriptions. 
 
Lead 
 
 
 
 
    JULY 2023 
 
Tips for reducing contaminated capillary lead tests: 
• 
Vigorous washing of the hand and nail must be completed to remove excess lead. 
• 
Do not simply wipe the finger with an alcohol prep pad. 
• 
Washing of the hand must be completed by the nurse, not the patient or patient’s guardian. 
• 
Use warm water when washing the hand to help blood flow and assure your specimen is adequate 
in volume. 
• 
Avoid drying the hand with recycled paper towels as these can be processed with materials that 
contain lead. 
• 
Do not allow the child to touch surfaces after the hand as been scrubbed. 
• 
Discard the first drop of blood to rid the finger of any remaining lead. 
For more information, watch the CDC’s guidance on avoiding contaminated specimens found here: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2p2qREch9g 
 
Using a Commercial Lab 
• 
All LHD staff obtaining blood lead specimens must be familiar with their analyzing labs’ requirements 
on blood lead specimen collection (check with the LHD analyzing lab) as indicated in the Training 
Requirements: AR/ Training Guidelines and Program Descriptions. 
• 
Blood lead tests that are analyzed through a commercial lab (such as MedTox, Mayo, LabCorp, 
Quest etc.) handle reporting these tests to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. Health 
departments do not need to report these tests to the cabinet. 
 
LeadCare Point-of-Care Devices 
All LHDs using LeadCare devices must be familiar with its specific user manual instructions on its use, KY 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) obligations and state (KRS 211.902) reporting 
requirements. A LeadCare device is not acceptable for confirming an EBLL >3.5 μg/dL. LeadCare 
devices can only be used as a screening tool and is not a diagnosis tool. 
If your LHD uses a LeadCare device, please contact the program epidemiologist to set up reporting of 
these lead tests. Visit https://kog.chfs.ky.gov/home/ to create an account to report these tests to the 
Cabinet for Health and Family Services as mandated by KRS 211.902. 
 
Initial Blood Lead Test 
A capillary or venous sample may be used for an initial BLL screening. Refer to Table 1 and Table 2 for 
further guidance. If the BLL is > to 3.5 μg/dL, read the section below on confirmatory blood lead 
tests.  
 
Confirmatory Blood Lead Tests 
A confirmatory test is used to assure an EBL result is indeed elevated and not the result of a 
contaminated specimen. If the capillary results are elevated (greater or equal > to 3.5 μg/dL), a 
confirmatory test must be completed through a venous sample per the CDC. If the initial screening 
test was a venous sample, the patient does not need another venous draw as venous blood lead tests 
are less likely to be contaminated. DO NOT WAIT TO CONFIRM AN EBLL. Delaying a confirmatory 
result only prolongs a child’s potential lead exposure. Refer to Table 1 and Table 2 for further guidance.

that education on ways to 
prevent lead poisoning begin at 
this level.) 
Lead Poisoning Prevention Education 
• 
If a screening test is completed at the LHD, 
anticipatory guidance and education should be 
reviewed with parent/guardian to include: 
o 
What is lead 
o 
The effects of lead 
o 
Potential lead sources 
o 
Temporary measures to control exposure 
o 
Dietary interventions 
o 
Proper hand washing and housecleaning 
techniques 
• 
Continue to review risk 
assessment questions at 
each preventive health 
visit up to 72 months of 
age. 
> 3.5 μg/dL 
• 
Confirm BLL through a 
venous sample if the initial 
test was capillary. 
• 
Confirm BLL through a venous sample if the initial 
test was capillary. Venous is considered confirmed. 
• 
Confirmatory tests should be performed 
immediately, but no later than: 
o

o 
Level 10 -19: within 1 month 
o

Lead Poisoning Prevention and Case Management 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), case management of children and 
pregnant women with EBLLs involves the coordination, provision and oversight of services required to 
reduce BLLs to below a level of concern. A hallmark of effective case management is the ongoing 
communication with caregivers and other service providers. This is a cooperative approach to solving any 
problems that may arise during efforts to decrease the patient’s EBLL by reducing or eliminating lead-
based health hazard exposure in the patient’s environment. 
 
Case management is much more than a simple referral to other service providers. There are eight 
components, which should be under the purview of a registered nurse: 
• 
Client identification and outreach 
• 
Individual assessment and diagnosis 
• 
Service planning and resource identification 
• 
Linking of clients to needed services 
• 
Service implementation and coordination 
• 
Monitoring of service delivery 
• 
Advocacy 
• 
Evaluation 
 
When a blood lead result is > 3.5 ug/dL, education on what lead is and sources of lead and how to 
minimize exposure must be provided to the family. Follow-up interventions must be initiated for every 
child and pregnant woman having a confirmed EBLL. Children and pregnant women with EBLLs become 
“health department patients” when that level is identified through LHD screening or are referred by the 
primary care physician, even if they are or have been receiving direct clinical services elsewhere. They 
will remain a health department patient until case closure. 
 
Until an electronic system is established, report forms are used to coordinate communication between the 
LHD lead case managers and KYCLPPP to ensure EBLLs receive appropriate and timely care. 
KYCLPPP monitors incoming lab data and compares with incoming LHD reports of EBLLs. Appropriate 
follow-up interventions need to be dated when completed. A physical address must be included to enter 
the data into the state data system. 
The KYCLPPP Case Management form must be filled out for all children and pregnant women having a 
confirmed EBLL of >3.5 μg/dL. The original report form is to be placed in the patient’s chart and a copy 
must be faxed to KYCLPPP. Updates on EBLLs and interventions must be made in the notes section and 
a copy faxed to KYCLPPP. Staff need to write the current BLL and date of specimen collection clearly 
on the notes page. 
 
Visual Investigative Home Visits 
Environmental Management through home visits is one component of the ongoing process related to the 
elimination of lead poisoning as a public health problem. 
Lead 
JULY 2023 
 
Environmental intervention through visual investigation 
• 
Help the family visually identify potential lead hazards in the child’s environment 
• 
Provide the family with educational materials/recommendations to reduce lead exposures and help 
guide the family in taking corrective action 
• 
Work to reduce patient’s EBLL to < 3.5 μg/dL by reducing/eliminating lead exposure 
• 
Ensure that patients with EBLLs receive timely and appropriate care. 
 
It is the responsibility of the case management nurse to request assistance from a certified risk assessor 
or environmentalist. A home visit can be performed solely by a nurse, but every effort should be made to 
include an environmentalist. 
 
It is also the responsibility of the case management nurse to compile the required home visit form 
(including the section completed by an environmentalist) and fax these to KYCLPPP at (502) 564-5766 
with Attn: KYCLPPP. 
 
Certified Risk Assessments 
According to KRS 211.905, for confirmed BLLs > 15μg/dL, an inspection (with sampling) of the property 
where a child seventy-two (72) months of age or younger routinely spends more than six hours per week 
must be completed to determine the existence of lead-based hazards. 
 
Priority of this inspection should be given to the child’s primary place of residence. The environmental 
investigations may include the visual investigative home visit as well as the comprehensive lead 
hazard/risk assessment/lead inspection (certified risk assessment) to determine the existence of lead- 
based hazards. (Only persons certified in Kentucky can complete the environmental lead risk 
assessment). 
 
Collaboration of the environmentalist and the lead case manager ensures appropriate and timely 
environmental intervention for patients with EBLL. Interventions during environmental investigations 
include: 
• 
Informing the patient/parent/guardian/caregiver of child’s EBLL, review level of understanding, and 
monitoring of BLLs. 
• 
Reviewing what lead poisoning is and common sources of lead and provide a review of lead 
poisoning preventive educational materials. 
• 
Reviewing lead poisoning prevention (increase Calcium, Iron and Vitamin C, low-fat diet, house 
cleaning techniques, minimizing the child’s exposure). 
• 
Reviewing the patient’s physical status, behavior problems/changes, nutritional status, and specific 
habits such as placing fingers in mouth or eating dirt/paint chips). 
• 
Establishing who is providing patient’s primary and acute health care. 
• 
Visualize the patient’s home environment and child’s play areas to help the family identify potential 
sources of lead and discuss preventive strategies to reduce the patient’s lead hazard exposure. 
• 
Ensure the well-being of the child by referring to appropriate agencies; services may include social 
services for emergency or temporary housing agencies and community partners to help correct 
potential lead health hazards. 
 
Environmental intervention is initiated for all cases referred into or already receiving services in a health 
department clinic with a confirmed EBLL >3.5 μg/dL.  
 
Upon receipt of confirmed EBLL, LHD staff are responsible for collaboration and referrals to the 
environmentalist for the appropriate environmental intervention. Environmentalists will only be aware of 
EBLL if the case-managing nurse informs them and requests assistance. 
 
For children identified as having BLLs of: 
• 
>3.5 μg/dL: A visual Investigative Home Visit is to be completed at the patient’s primary residence to 
help families in visually identifying potential sources of lead-based health hazard exposure. 
• 
>15μg/dL: In addition to the visual investigative home visit, a referral must be made to the 
environmentalist to ensure a lead hazard inspection/risk assessment with sampling is completed by a 
Lead 
JULY 2023 
 
certified risk assessor. Requesting a risk assessment is the responsibility of the case managing nurse. 
 
Investigation of the Primary Address 
Part I of the home visit form must be initiated by the LHD case-managing nurse. This equips the 
environmentalist with information in best identifying potential sources of current and past lead hazard 
exposure. Investigations must be conducted within the appropriate timeframes according to CDC’s 
recommendations (See Table 4). Early intervention helps families in identifying potential lead hazard sources, 
ways on minimizing exposure and in providing a review of lead poisoning preventive education with the 
parent/guardian/caregiver. This works to ensure prevention of further lead hazard exposure and further elevation 
of the BLL.

A thorough visual investigation of the child’s home helps families to identify possible sources of lead. The 
investigator must visually assess both the interior and exterior environment of the child with attention given to 
those areas that are child-accessible, painted surfaces, and areas with dust and soil accumulation. Other 
potential sources of lead must also be considered during the assessment (i.e., water, family occupation, 
hobbies, etc.). A lead exposure can frequently include multiple sources. 
 
At the time of the Home Visit, preventive education should be reviewed with the parents/guardians/caregiver. 
Preventive education includes discussing the child’s potential source(s) of lead hazards, how to prevent the 
patient’s access and further exposure to those sources, an increase in the child’s hand washing with soap and 
water (especially prior to eating/snacking and sleep times), and house cleaning techniques such as damp 
dusting, wet mopping, and daily vacuuming of the home. 
Temporary measures to reduce further exposure are recommended to immediately keep the child from accessing 
potential lead hazard sources. 
 
If the child’s BLL should increase to a confirmed level of > 15ug/dL, certified risk assessment is required. The 
case should be referred to the environmentalist by the case managing nurse. 
 
Helping a Family Reduce a Lead Exposure 
If there are suspected or identified lead hazards, intervention should include educating the family on how to 
use temporary measures to prevent child access to the sources. Temporary measures may include but are not 
limited to: 
• 
Blocking child access to a potentially hazardous area with a barrier (i.e., door, child gate, furniture. 
• 
Use of duct or masking tape and plastic or cardboard to cover an area of chipping/peeling surface until 
permanent work can be conducted. 
• 
Daily damp dust, wet mop, and vacuum with a HEPA vacuum especially in the child’s play area. 
• 
Wipe child’s toys clean, keep toys in clean, dry tote, and place tote in cleaned play area and limiting the 
child’s play to only this area (especially if child is crawling and/or in hand-to-mouth exploration stage). 
Lead 
JULY 2023 
 
• 
Keep child’s hands washed with soap and water (germ gel does not remove lead), wash hands 
before snacks and meals and before any sleep times, nap, or bedtime (especially if child is crawling 
and/or in hand-to-mouth exploration stage). 
• 
Leaving shoes outside or placing shoes in a tote or shelf out of the child’s reach to keep lead 
dust/paint chips from being tracked in from outside. 
• 
Exploring the possibility to relocate children and pregnant women from the home while 
renovation/remediation work is in progress. 
• 
Ensure the family is using lead safety work practices during renovations, providing containment areas 
(walk off areas, plastic off door areas, remove shoes/clothing before entering living spaces, daily 
clean up and vacuuming of work and walk off areas). Brochures on renovation can be found and 
ordered at: http://www2.epa.gov/lead/brochures-and-posters. 
If the BLL remains > 3.5ug/dL and is not decreasing within 8-12 weeks, environmental intervention may 
need to be conducted at another property where the child routinely spends more than six hours per week. 
 
 
Additional and Follow-Up Home Visits 
Additional or follow-up home visits ensure preventive measures for lead poisoning prevention are 
continuing. Conducting additional or follow-up home visits is at the discretion of the case- managing nurse 
and relevant LHD staff. Some reasons why an additional or follow-up home visit might be completed: 
a. BLLs remain elevated or are increasing over a period of months. 
b. The child moves to a new residence. 
c. 
Custody of the child changes and the new guardians need assistance controlling a lead exposure. 
d. A new lead source is discovered, and the family needs further assistance on controlling the exposure. 
 
Case Closure 
Case closure is determined according to the case’s highest confirmed blood level and can be closed as 
follows: 
 
• 
For BLLs of 3.5-14.9 μg/dL -Case closure occurs when BLL is < 3.5 μg/dL, repeat at- risk blood 
             testing as indicated.  
 
• 
For BLLs of 15μg/dL and greater– Case closure occurs when BLL is < 3.5 μg/dL for at least six 
months, environmental hazards have been addressed; there are no new environmental hazards or 
as ordered by the physician.  
 
• 
For a pregnant woman with an EBLL- case closure of the pregnant woman occurs at the time of 
the delivery of the newborn. If the pregnant woman’s BLL is > 25 μg/dL, the mother will need to 
follow-up with their PCP. The newborn will need to be tested at delivery using a cord blood 
sample. Case management follow-up must be initiated for newborns with BLLs >3.5 μg/dL. 
 
A case may also be designated as administrative closure if all directives, as enumerated in the “Follow- 
up/Internal Tracking/Referral” section, have been completed. The case manager must follow and 
document all procedures for closure in a “lost to follow up” case closure. 
 
Referring a family to Department for Community Based Services (DCBS) based on non-compliance is at 
the discretion of the case-managing nurse and any specific health department guidance. Please see 
Administrative Reference (AR) Volume I, Abuse, Neglect and Violence section/ Department for 
Community Based Services. If the only deciding factor is non- compliance for lead follow-up care, special 
consideration must be given to the severity of the child’s elevation. 
 
When a case is closed to follow-up, please provide the date, reason for case closure, and any 
actions/interventions or comments on the case report form in area provided. If a case has been closed 
and a new EBLL is identified, please open a new case, and send a new report form with the initial BLL 
and updated information. Please do not continue to use the old file and write “reopened”.

1. Collecting or verifying the Newborn Metabolic Screen
a. For infants receiving wellchild/EPSDTservices at the LHD, the LHD shouldverify and
chart the results of the Newborn Screening Dried Blood Spot test and Critical
Congenital Heart Defect screening at the first well child visit.
b. Ifthoseresults have not been received, the LHDshouldcontact the Division of Lab
Services (DLS), Newborn Screening Division at
•
502-782-7713 or
•
502-782-7734 to obtain those results and put them in the infant’s
chart.
c. LHDs shouldrequest access for obtaining NBSresults electronically with the DLS NBS
Division.
d. Initial Screening should occur at the LHD when an infant has not received the dried
blood spot newborn screening or critical congenital heart defect screening as a result
of: 
•
home delivery
•
early hospital discharge (release less than 24hours); or
•
the parent has been notified that the dried blood spot newborn
screen needs to be repeated.
e. If a newborn screening dried blood spot specimen is obtained at the LHD, it is the
LHD’s responsibility to monitor and chart the outcome of the newborn screening test
until no further testing is required or the infant has been linked to a university specialist 
and a local medical home. 
2. NewbornMetabolic Screening Results:
a. Unsatisfactory Specimen:
•
DLSwillnotify the LHDtoobtain another dried blood spot specimen
immediately.
•
The parent/guardianwill besent a letterfromthe MCH NBS program to
contact their PCP for additional testing.
b. Abnormal Specimen:
•
DLS and MCHNBS notify the PCP, and University Specialist for further
evaluation and guidance for the parent/guardian to follow.
•
MCH NBS calls the university specialist and PCP with results and
sends a packet of information that includes information about the
abnormalresult and educational handouts for the parent/guardian.
•
If the LHD is the PCP for the newborn, this information will be sent to
the fax number supplied on the dried blood spot specimen.
•
IF the LHD is not the PCP – they should clearly note the correct name
and contact number for the PCP on the dried blood spot specimen to
prevent delay in care for the newborn.
c. Repeat Labs required: Some NBS results require a variety of repeat labs be obtained for
further evaluation/screening. In the event, these are required, the need is reflected in the
notes at the bottom of the NBS lab report.
•
A letter requesting repeat test(s) from the MCH NBS program is sent to
the infant’s health caregiver/submitter (physician, hospital, primary care
provider or LHD).
•
Insome instances, the submitter is notified via telephone.
•
MCH NBS staff will send a letter to the infant’s mother or guardian
notifying of the continued need for repeat testing.
•
LHD should continue to monitor and/or obtain results during subsequent
visits until a normal result is received or a referral has been made to a
university specialist for diagnostic evaluation.

ORAL HEALTH PROTOCOLS 
The Oral Health Program - Cabinet for Health and Family Services (ky.gov) offers a variety of programs 
and services which include, but are not limited to, fluoride supplements, fluoride varnishes and hygiene 
services. 
Sections of this document contain guidelines, (recommendations for patient management) and protocols, 
(authoritative statements requiring a physician’s or dentist’s signature). Both are contained in the specific 
sections. It is the local agency’s responsibility to obtain appropriate signatures ANNUALLY on each of 
the protocols. 
The following table is a list of Protocols by Section to facilitate identification of those items requiring a 
physician’s and/or dentist’s signature.

JULY 2023 
 
 
FLUORIDE SUPPLEMENT PROGRAM GUIDELINES 
1. The program is primarily for pre-school children (6 months–6 years) but may be provided up to 
age 16 (targeting children who do not attend a school with fluoridated water), who are not 
presently receiving fluoridated drinking water, other fluoride supplements, or vitamins with 
fluoride. 
 
2. Whether or not a child is receiving fluoride can be determined by the answers to questions on the 
questionnaire and consent form (OH-9). A copy of the form is included in this section. 
 
3. When bottled water is being used as the primary source of drinking water, the fluoride content of 
the water should be determined. If the child’s legal representative is unaware of the fluoride 
content of the bottled water, there are several sources of information, which can be helpful in 
learning the fluoride content of different brands of bottled water. Generally, bottled water has a 
toll-free phone number printed on the label, or a product web site, which can be accessed to learn 
the fluoride content of the bottled water. Additional sources for learning the fluoride content of 
bottled water can be found at International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) Information Hotline: 
1-800-WATER-11 or the International Bottled Water Association Website 
https://bottledwater.org/list-of-brands-containing-fluoride/. Do not submit a sample of bottled 
water for testing, without first attempting to determine the fluoride content of the bottled water. 
 
4. If the child is not receiving fluoride in the water supply, an analysis of the natural fluoride content 
of the home water supply must be performed prior to prescribing fluoride supplementation. 
Instructions for taking and submitting a water sample are provided on the reverse side of 
“Information for Parents or Guardians”. 
 
5. The maximum amount of fluoride a child under six should receive is 0.5 mg. fluoride ion per day. 
 
6. Fluoride drops (8 drops–1 mg. fluoride ion) are packaged in plastic bottles containing one ounce 
liquid with about 500 drops (62.5 mg. fluoride ion) per bottle. 
 
7. Dosage levels of fluoride drops, or tablets depend on the age of the child and the amount of 
fluoride in the drinking water (from fluoride water sample tests). The dosage schedule for fluoride 
drops or tablets is included in the fluoride supplement protocols. For patients with abnormal 
fluoride test results of water samples submitted to the Division of Laboratory Services, issuing of 
fluoride supplements (drops or tablets) and follow-up should be followed per protocol. 
 
8. If the test results from the water sample are: 
• 
Equal to or greater than 2.00 ppm fluoride concentration, submit another sample of 
the water source to the State Lab for confirmation testing. 
o 
If both water samples are equal to or greater than 2.00 ppm up to 4.00 ppm 
fluoride concentration, recommend to the parent or guardian that children equal 
to or less than 8 years of age should consume another source of water. 
• 
Equal to or greater than 4.00 ppm fluoride concentration, recommend that both 
children and adults should consume another source of water. 
o 
The Environmental Protection Agency classifies water with equal to or greater 
          461
Oral Health Protocols 
JULY 2023 
 
 
than 2.00 ppm fluoride concentration as the Secondary Containment Level and 
water with equal to or greater than 4.00 ppm fluoride concentration as the 
Maximum Containment Level for fluoride in water. 
o 
When both water samples are equal to or greater than 4.00 ppm fluoride 
concentration, the nurse working with the Fluoride Supplement Program in the 
local health department should contact the local health department 
environmentalists and request an investigation of the water source. 
• 
If the second water samples, comes back less than 2.00 ppm, submit a third water 
sample to the Division for Laboratory Services for testing. 
o 
If fluoride concentration in two of the three samples is less than 2.00 ppm, follow 
the Fluoride Supplements Protocols for water samples with fluoride 
concentrations less than 2.00 ppm. If the fluoride concentration in two of the 
three samples are equal to or greater than 2.00 ppm, follow Fluoride Supplement 
Protocols for water samples with fluoride concentrations equal to or greater than 
2.00 ppm. 
For further clarifications and directions, call the Oral Health Program at 502-564- 
3246. 
9. Orders for fluoride supplement drops or tablets must be signed by the health officer, another 
physician, a dentist, or another health professional with prescriptive authority. Protocols may 
be used—one copy will cover all children in the program. A sample copy is included in this 
section. 
 
10. Parents or guardians must be advised concerning the importance of giving their child no more 
than the prescribed amounts of fluoride. It should be called to the attention of the parent or 
guardian that excessive amounts (i.e., more than 2 mg. per day) over an extended period of 
time (two or three months) may cause tooth discoloration during their development; with 
white spots appearing on the child’s permanent teeth. In addition, they need to be told of the 
potentially toxic nature of fluoride when ingested in large doses at a single time. 
 
If, for example, a 22-pound child takes 264 mg. of sodium fluoride 
(120 mg. fluoride ion) at any single time, symptoms of acute toxicity 
can occur (stomach upset, vomiting). The minimum lethal dose for a 
22-pound child is 480 mg. of sodium fluoride. 
 
11. If it is determined that a child will participate in a preventive dental program, a questionnaire and 
consent form, the fluoride analysis of home water supply report, and a record of the amount of 
fluoride to be provided, if needed, shall be made a part of the child’s permanent health record. 
(Each participating child in the family must have a signed questionnaire and consent form and a 
record of the amount of fluoride to be taken.) 
 
12. If more than one child in a family is to receive the fluoride supplement, written instructions for 
each child must be given to the parent. 
 
 
13. A 3-month supply of supplements may be provided for each child in a family. Empty containers 
should be returned before providing a replacement. At this time, a determination should be made 
whether circumstances affecting the amount of fluoride supplement to be provided have changed, 
such as change in address, change in water source or the ‘aging out’ of the impacted children.

FLUORIDE SUPPLEMENT PROTOCOL 
Infants and preschool children who are not drinking fluoridated water or who are not taking vitamins with 
fluoride should be given this essential nutrient. A laboratory test done on a sample of drinking water 
supply will tell how much fluoride is in the water and the amount of the supplement that may be needed. 
Call the Oral Health Program at 502-564-3246 to order forms, fluoride supplements, water sample, and 
collection kits or if further information is needed.

KIDS SMILE PROGRAM 
FLUORIDE VARNISH PROGRAM 
1. The Kentucky Oral Health Program has provided funding for fluoride varnish programs in local 
health departments. The Kentucky Oral Health Program offers training to local health department 
nurses in areas of oral health screening, fluoride varnish application, oral health prevention 
messages, and procedures to determine when and how to make proper referrals to oral health 
professionals. 
 
2. Fluoride varnishes are primarily used as a decay prevention therapy for pediatric patients and 
persons at a high-risk for tooth decay. Individual who benefits the most from fluoride varnish 
include children, ages 0 through 5 years who have a family history of decay, low levels of fluoride 
in their drinking water or limited access to dental care. At the minimum, the fluoride varnish 
should be applied 2 times a year and those children who are at higher risk for decay may require 
more frequent applications. Because of recent studies showing positive results, children through 
the fifth grade may receive fluoride varnish, using the same protocol as those services for 
children less than six years of age. 
 
 
3. Criteria for the use of fluoride varnish include the presence of factors that put a child at risk for 
decay. Clinical criteria include: visible plaque on the front teeth, decayed teeth, white-spot lesions 
or a family history of decay. Other criteria include: socioeconomic status and dental value of the 
primary caregiver. 
 
4. Instructions for applying cavity varnish for decay reduction vary among the brands of products, 
always read and follow manufacturer’s instructions for any product. 
 
 
5. Equipment and materials: non-latex gloves, toothbrush, fluoride varnish and applicator, mouth 
mirror, 2x2 gauze squares (in kit supplied by KDPH) and post-procedure instructions. 
 
6. Apply fluoride varnish: 
a. Order the materials for application of fluoride varnish from the University of Kentucky 
College of Dentistry. LHDs should use this address for ordering kits: 
kidsmiles@uky.edu 
b. The Oral Health Program uses 3M’s formulation of Vanish that includes the same new 
technology as previous products: free calcium and phosphate that is available for 
immediate uptake into vulnerable surfaces. 
c. 
Position the child. Use the "knee-to-knee" technique for positioning. The child should sit 
in the caregiver’s lap, facing the caregiver. Then, have the caregiver lower the child's 
head into your lap. 
d. Brush the child’s teeth with the toothbrush included in the kit. This removes current 
plaque so the varnish can reach the at-risk areas without impediment. It also creates an 
opportunity for correct hygiene instruction with the patient or the attending 
parent/guardian. 
e. Prepare the fluoride varnish for single-dose containers. The supplies used to apply the 
varnish include a 0.50 ml unit dose package of fluoride varnish and applicator brush. For 
the primary dentition, the entire contents of the 0.50 ml unit of fluoride varnish do 
not have to be used – about half is usually sufficient to coat all the baby teeth. 
          466
Oral Health Protocols 
JULY 2023 
 
 
Instructions for use: 
1) 
Dispense the entire contents of the unit-dose package onto the gloved hand opposite the hand 
that will apply the varnish to the teeth. 
2) 
Thoroughly mix the varnish with the applicator brush, keeping the material inside the circle. 
3) 
Remove excess saliva from around teeth with the 2x2 gauze sponge. 
4) 
Apply varnish evenly over all tooth surfaces particularly the buccal (cheek side) and facial (toward 
the lips) aspects of the upper and lower baby (primary) teeth with an emphasis on the high-risk 
areas: upper front teeth, lip side near the gumline. 
5) 
A thin coating of the white-colored varnish may be visible on the teeth. The child may be able to 
feel the coating with rubbing the teeth with their tongue. 
 
6) 
The provider should offer a small drink of water to the patient immediately after the application 
procedure is finished. 
 
7) 
Instructions to give caregivers or older children without parent at visit (i.e., school) for after-care 
treatment include: 
f. 
Do not remove the varnish by brushing or flossing for the remainder of the day. Wait until 
the next morning to resume normal oral hygiene. 
g. The child should eat a soft diet for the remainder of the day. Avoid hot liquids, hard and 
sticky foods for the rest of the day. 
h. To receive the maximum decay prevention benefit, multiple applications of fluoride 
varnish are needed. The varnish needs to be reapplied at least every 6 months, 
depending on child’s risk for developing decay. 
 
8) 
Document procedures for the day in the personal medical record provided by the Kentucky Oral 
Health Program or current electronic health records.

PEDIATRIC PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE 
 
Pediatric exams for preventive care should follow and meet the standards as established by the 
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and referenced through the Bright Futures Guidelines for 
Health Supervision of Infants, Children and Adolescents. Each LHD is responsible for ensuring 
practice standards/clinical practice is in alignment with the most recent information from the AAP. The 
clinical practice, preventive services, periodicity schedule and anticipatory guidance can be found at 
the following links. These are updated periodically by the AAP and LHDs must develop a process for 
ensuring they are reviewing the latest updates available. 
 
The following are direct links to Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children 
and Adolescents, 4th Edition. Each link has tables that provide reference information for each well- 
child visit to include relevant history, risk assessment, and action for abnormal findings. 
 
• 
Infancy Medical Screening Reference (MSR) Tables (0 - 9 Months) 
• 
Early Childhood Medical Screening Reference (MSR) Tables (12 Months - 4 Years) 
• 
Middle Childhood Medical Screening Reference (MSR) Tables (5 - 10 Years) 
• 
Adolescence Medical Screening Reference (MSR) Tables (11 - 21 Years) 
 
 
A preventive pediatric exam should include all components as defined by the American Academy 
of Pediatrics, Bright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescent. 
Abnormal findings may require additional exams by the primary health care provider, or a health 
care specialist. 
Comprehensive health and developmental history, including assessment of physical and 
mental health development 
Physical examination - A comprehensive unclothed physical exam as per at brightfutures.aap.org. 
Nutritional assessment - Assessment is based on the child’s health history, physical exam 
including oral exam, growth pattern, and appropriate blood work as identified on periodicity 
schedule (usually, this includes hemoglobin and lead screening). It is also recommended that 
providers plot body mass index (BMI) beginning at age 2. 
Developmental surveillance or screening: (the process of recognizing children who may be at risk 
of developmental delays) should be incorporated into every visit, except for the 9-month, 18-month, 
and 30-month visits. 
Structured developmental screening (the use of standardized tools to identify and refine the risk 
of developmental delays) should be administered regularly during the 9-month, 18-month, and 
30-month visits. Psychosocial/behavioral assessment 
Psychosocial/behavioral assessment. This assessment should be family centered and may include 
an assessment of child’s social-emotional health, caregiver depression, and social determinants of 
health. 
Vision assessment or screening: Direct referral to an optometrist or ophthalmologist is required 
when objective screening methods indicate a referral is warranted. 
Hearing assessment or screening: Required at 4 to 5 years old should be administered in 
the primary care providers, or the patient should be referred to a hearing specialist. 
Oral Health: The risk assessment, as well as referrals to a home dentist, should also be 
provided at when indicated.

Administration of or referral to any laboratory tests, procedures, or immunizations appropriate for 
age and risk factors as identified during the clinical exam, or as per Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practice (ACIP) and as by 902 KAR 2:060. 
Health education: Patient health education is a required component and should include 
documented and appropriate anticipatory guidance to promote understanding of what to 
expect in terms of the child’s development, healthy lifestyle choices, and accident and 
disease prevention. 
Diagnostic Services and Follow-Up Treatment 
Providers must assist in setting appointments to establish a medical home for the infant or child. 
Abnormalities identified should be referred to the appropriate provider for ongoing evaluation and care.

• 
Preterm Birth Prevention: Patients with a history of previous preterm 
birth/PPROM, or with a history of cervical incompetence/short cervical length must 
be referred to an obstetrician prior to 18-20 weeks to be evaluated for possible use 
of progesterone to prevent preterm birth. 
• 
Immunization Status: Every pregnant woman should be immunized appropriately if 
indicated. Influenza illness can cause complications in both mother and baby, so 
vaccine should be offered in season regardless of stage of pregnancy. According to 
ACOG guidelines, pregnant women may receive vaccinations with an inactivated 
virus, bacterial vaccine, or toxoid; however, exposure to live vaccines should be 
avoided during pregnancy. Refer to the Immunization Section for details.

Prenatal Risk Assessment: Risk factors should be reviewed each trimester. ACOG recommends  
psychosocial screening on a regular basis to increase the likelihood of successful interventions.  
Screening should include assessment such as barriers to care, unstable housing, communication  
barriers, nutrition, tobacco, alcohol and substance use, depression, safety, intimate partner  
violence (IPV) and stress. These factors can contribute to risk of preterm birth, which should also  
be assessed. 
• 
Intimate Partner Violence (IPV): Screening should be done by a health care provider who has been  
educated and trained in domestic violence and who is qualified to document in the medical record.  
Screening should be for current and past domestic violence that occurred anytime in a woman’s  
life. If a patient confides that she is being abused, verbatim accounts of the abuse should be  
recorded in the medical record and appropriate referrals made. The health care provider should  
inquire about her immediate safety and the safety of the children. ACOG Intimate Partner Violence  
Committee Opinion No. 518 and Reproductive and Sexual Coercion Committee Opinion No. 554  
are available at:  
https://www.acog.org/search#q=Committee%20Opinion%20on%20%20Intimate%20partner%20viol 
ence&sort=relevancy at.  
• 
Pelvic Exam/PAP Test: A pelvic exam should be completed on every pregnant woman at the initial  
prenatal exam regardless of whether a PAP test is performed. If the patient is due a PAP test  
according to the guidelines, she should provide documentation of her last PAP test or else will need 
to have a PAP test completed at the initial prenatal exam. Refer to the Cancer Screening Follow-Up 
section for the list of guidelines to determine the need for a PAP test and proper follow-up. 
• 
Folic Acid: Before pregnancy and during pregnancy, women need 400 micrograms (mcg.) of folic  
acid daily to help prevent neural tube defects. History should be assessed to determine if a higher  
dose of folic acid is required. 
• 
Prenatal Vitamins: Vitamin supplementation should be prescribed/encouraged during pregnancy,  
the post-partum period and the duration of breastfeeding and should meet the dietary reference  
intakes (see next page). This list is not all-inclusive and generically equivalent prenatal vitamin  
substitutes may be used. (Note: Prenatal vitamins may not be charged to the WIC program.) 
• 
Medication Use: Prenatal clients should be advised to consult with their health care provider before  
using non-prescription drugs or herbal remedies during pregnancy. All medications taken during the 
pregnancy including non-prescription meds, vitamins and herbal supplements should be noted in  
the patient record. 
• 
Alcohol, Tobacco, Other Drug Use (ATOD): All pregnant women should be screened at the first  
prenatal visit about their past and present use of alcohol, tobacco, secondhand smoke exposure  
and other drugs, including recreational use of prescriptions and over-the-counter medications. This  
should be documented in the medical record and clients should be educated and referred  
appropriately. The Pregnancy Health Risk Screen (PN-2) is an optional evidence-based screening  
questionnaire specifically designed for pregnant women who are at risk for these behaviors. In  
addition to the ATOD screening, this questionnaire incorporates screening for domestic violence  
and maternal mental health issues with brief intervention guidelines, as well as suggested actions.

recommend a vitamin that would fall between the minimum and maximum levels and is approved 
by the prenatal provider. 
• 
During the second (2nd) trimester the prenatal supplement should contain at least the following: 
Iron 30 mg; Zinc 15 mg.; Copper 2 mg.; Calcium 250 mg.; Vitamin B6 2 mg.; Folic Acid 300 mcg.; 
Vitamin C 50 mg. and Vitamin D 5 mcg.

• 
Poor weight gain can be a sign of poor fetal growth and must be evaluated by the PCP, as well 
as any rapid weight gain (especially after 24 weeks gestation). 
• 
Determining appropriate weight gain is professional judgment that must be based upon the 
individual client’s unique circumstances and weeks of gestation. 
• 
The pregnant woman must be referred to Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) for low maternal weight 
gain, IUGR or oligohydramnios, BMI <18, eating disorders, lead poisoning, anemia and 
excessive/inadequate weight gain. Other conditions to consider referring include chronic disease, 
breastfeeding, HIV/AIDS, hyperemesis gravidarum, homelessness, multiple gestation, overweight, 
age <17 or >35, food insecurity and weight loss during pregnancy. 
*Excessive weight gain = greater than eight pounds/month 
*Inadequate weight gain = less that two pounds/month after 1st trimester References:

Body Mass Index (BMI) 
All Pregnant Women 
 
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure that can help determine if a person is at risk for a weight-related 
illness. To use this chart, find the height in the left-hand column. Move across the row until you find the 
weight. The number at the top of the column is the BMI. Legend is as follows: Underweight= BMI < 19.8; 
Normal= BMI 19.8-26.0; Overweight= BMI 26.1-29.0; Obese= BMI > 29.1

Prenatal Lead Screening Guidelines 
 
• 
Risk of lead exposure in pregnancy. 
Lead is a naturally occurring toxic element that can cause devastating fetal effects. Lead crosses 
the placental barrier and the developing nervous system of the fetus is particularly vulnerable to 
lead toxicity. Some studies have shown that blood lead levels as low as 5 mcg/dl may result in 
adverse pregnancy outcomes including spontaneous abortion, premature birth, stillbirth, birth 
defects and decreased intellect and/or behavior problems in the child. 
A special concern for pregnant women is that past bone lead accumulation may be released into 
the blood during pregnancy. Studies have also shown that males exposed to lead may have 
decreased sperm counts and/or abnormal sperm morphology. 
 
• 
Patient assessment and education 
All prenatal patients shall be assessed for potential lead poisoning at the initial prenatal work-up 
visit and be given the PAM-ACH-25. The need for blood testing is based on a yes response to 
one or more lead risk assessment questions. The questions to determine risk status have been 
incorporated into the patient handout “What is Lead?” (PAM-ACH-25), that is available on the 
DPH website. 
 
• 
Indications for blood testing 
If a prenatal patient answers yes to one or more of the four risk assessment questions at the 
initial visit, a venous blood specimen should be drawn the same day. A purple-top tube should be 
drawn immediately and sent for analysis. This blood test should be drawn at the same time as the 
other prenatal lab work. 
 
• 
Results of screening test: 
 
Level 5-14.9 mcg/dl 
Level > 15 mcg/dl

Notify delivering physician of test results and 
repeat blood specimen in 8 weeks. 
At-risk prenatal patients should be followed up 
by case management. * 
At-risk prenatal patients should be followed up 
by case management. * 
Refer women for an environmental risk 
assessment. * 
 
*Guidelines for home visits, case management and environmental risk assessments should be 
referenced from the Lead section. 
 
• 
Documentation: 
Documentation in the medical record should be brief, such as “PAM-ACH-25 provided and 
discussed with no risk factors found” or “PAM-ACH-25 provided and discussed and blood to lab 
for screening due to positive risk factors.” Any further interventions should also be documented in 
the patient’s medical record. 
• 
Environmental and Clinical Health should work together on all prenatal cases of lead exposure or 
lead poisoning. Time to correct the problem is limited and critical in preventing poor pregnancy 
outcomes. Pregnant women with lead levels above 5mcg/dl should be advised that any children 
in the household (6 months-6 years) should be referred to the LDH’s Well-Child/EPSDT program 
or their primary care provider for lead screening.

Hepatitis B in Pregnancy 
 
KRS 214.160 requires that all pregnant women shall be screened for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAB) 
during every pregnancy. This testing shall be completed regardless of past test results or Hepatitis B 
immunization status and should be completed at the initial prenatal visit. If the woman is high-risk for 
contracting Hepatitis B, the serological testing should be repeated in the third trimester. 
 
• 
Negative test and vaccination in pregnancy 
Any pregnant woman with a negative Hepatitis B HBsAG who is at risk for acquiring Hepatitis B 
infection should receive the vaccine as soon as possible. The vaccine is purified surface antigen 
and poses no risk to the fetus. SEE: Immunization protocols for specific information on vaccine 
administration. 
 
• 
Positive test 
Refer to the Immunization/Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention program and Case Management 
Protocol section of the CSG for reporting, management and required tracking of mother and 
infant. 
 
Hepatitis C in Pregnancy 
 
Hepatitis C (HCV) is a viral infection that is spread by direct contact with infected blood. An infected 
person may or may not have symptoms. Pregnant women with HCV infection should be referred to a sub- 
specialist for further evaluation and management. According to revised KRS 214.160, each pregnant 
woman in Kentucky shall be screened for Hepatitis C. The test results shall be recorded in the woman’s 
permanent medical record and the permanent medical record of the child or children she was pregnant 
with at the time of testing after birth. The prenatal provider shall verbally inform the pregnant woman or 
the legal guardian of the child/children affected during the pregnancy and document that in the medical 
record; and that KRS 214.160 recommends that all children born to HCV-positive women receive 
serologic testing for the presence of Hepatitis C virus antibodies and confirmatory RNA bloodwork. 
 
A baby can be infected during birth if the mother has HCV infection. There are no effective preventive 
measures to decrease the transmission of HCV from an infected mother to the baby during delivery. 
Pregnant women who are positive for HCV infection should be counseled that a cesarean section delivery 
will not decrease the transmission of HCV infection to her baby. Women who are positive for HCV 
infection can still breastfeed but should consider abstaining if their nipples are cracked or bleeding.

Preventing Perinatal HIV/AIDS Transmission 
 
All pregnant women should be counseled on HIV, including identification of risk factors and effective ways 
to reduce risk. Because of recent advances in both antiretroviral and obstetrical interventions, the use of 
antiretroviral medications during pregnancy and delivery, and with the newborn in the first few weeks of 
life, the rate of vertical transmission can be reduced from 25% to 2%. 
 
• 
All pregnant women should be screened for HIV infection at the initial prenatal visit regardless of 
risk factors. 
• 
The PAM-ACH-263 or ACOG Patient Fact Sheet PFS005 should be provided to the patient on 
the initial prenatal visit and documented in the medical record. 
• 
Repeat HIV testing in the third trimester, preferably before 36 weeks gestation, is recommended 
for women in areas with a high incidence or prevalence of HIV and for women who are known to 
be or report risk for acquiring HIV. 
• 
Informed consent before testing is essential. Women shall be told they are being tested for HIV 
as part of the routine panel of prenatal tests unless they decline (opt out). Patient notification 
allows a woman to decline testing if she feels it is not in her best interest. Discussing and 
addressing reasons for refusal can promote health education and trust building and allow some 
women to accept testing later. 
• 
Documentation of informed consent shall use language the client understands. 
• 
Pregnant women should be provided with verbal and/or written information about HIV, including 
interventions to reduce the risk of transmission from mother to infant. No additional written 
documentation of informed consent beyond that which is required for routine prenatal testing is 
recommended. Refusal of the HIV test at the initial visit or at the recommended retesting time 
frame should be documented in the medical record. 
• 
Women who have an established diagnosis of HIV/AIDS should be linked to specialists in HIV 
care for ongoing care and co-management. 
 
See HIV/AIDS section for further information and protocols.

Multiple Marker Test (Triple or Quad Screen) 
 
Maternal serum screening has become an important, non-invasive diagnostic tool for several congenital 
and chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. The Triple Screen measures alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), 
human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), and unconjugated estriol levels. If a fourth substance, Inhibin – A 
is added then it is called a Quadruple Screen. 
 
• 
All prenatal clients should have the triple screen test performed between 15-20 weeks gestation. 
The most ideal screening time is between 16-18 weeks. Patient counseling must emphasize this 
is a screening test that will identify a high-risk pregnancy. If the patient declines testing this 
should be documented in the medical record. 
• 
The multiple marker specimen must be submitted to a clinical laboratory that has normative data 
specific to each week of gestation and is able to provide interpretation that considers maternal 
age, weight, race and relevant history such as diabetes and neural tube defects. Imprecise 
information could lead to inaccurate test results.

• 
An abnormal Multiple Marker Test result is not diagnostic of a fetal anomaly but does warrant 
further evaluation. 
o 
Do not repeat the test if you receive an abnormal result. 
o 
Refer for ultrasound to determine an identifiable cause. Incorrect EDC, multiple 
gestation or fetal death may be the cause of the abnormal result as well as congenital 
anomalies. 
• 
If the ultrasound confirms the presence of a congenital anomaly, the client should be referred 
immediately to a physician who provides care for high-risk obstetrical patients. 
• 
If the ultrasound fails to determine a cause of the abnormal test, the client should be referred to 
an obstetrician for possible amniocentesis.

Cystic Fibrosis Screening 
 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by changes in a pair of CF genes and is usually 
diagnosed in the first few years of life. Cystic Fibrosis causes problems with digestion and breathing but 
does not affect intelligence or appearance. Both parents must be carriers for the baby to develop CF, and 
each pregnancy has a 25% change of developing CF. Most clients are unfamiliar with CF and will need 
education. Written educational materials or other formats should be used to educate patients and 
partners. Counseling regarding CF carrier testing is usually done by the primary obstetric care provider. In 
some circumstances a referral to a medical geneticist may be helpful. 
 
• 
CF screening should be offered to all prenatal clients, although non-Hispanic White and 
Ashkenazi Jewish populations are at a higher risk. 
• 
Newborn screening panels that include CF screening do not replace maternal carrier screening. 
• 
If the client has previously been screened for CF the results should be documented by the test 
should not be repeated. 
• 
Appropriate screening does not include complete analysis of the CFTR gene by DNA sequencing 
or a newborn screening panel that includes CF screening. 
• 
If the client’s screening test shows that she is a carrier, the father of the baby should be offered 
testing. This test may be performed by the LHD or referral can be made to a provider for testing. 
The LHD, however, does not have to pay for this test and it should not be coded to cost center 
803. If testing is provided at the LHD, the father should sign a consent form. Any education and 
interventions should be documented. 
• 
The provider may offer the client additional testing during pregnancy, such as chorionic villus 
sampling (generally done around 11th week of gestation) and amniocentesis (generally done 
around 16th week of gestation) to further determine if the fetus has CF. 
• 
Cystic Fibrosis is not a curable disease and there are no treatments available before the baby is 
born. There are treatments available after birth. Families can use the time prior to birth to educate 
themselves on CF, current treatment options and the experiences of families with CF children as 
well as talking to care providers. 
• 
Documentation of the consent process is important. A sample consent for is available in English 
and Spanish in the Forms Section.

Perinatal Group B Streptococcus Screening 
 
The adherence to the most current CDC algorithm for GBS screening is estimated to prevent 
approximately 90% of newborn Group B Streptococcus infections. All prenatal clients should be screened 
for GBS between 35-37 weeks gestation. Clinicians should follow the most recent CDC/ACOG algorithms 
for management. 
 
Screening Procedure 
• 
Swab the lower vagina (vaginal introitus), followed by the rectum (through the anal sphincter) 
using the same or two different swabs. 
Cervical, peri-anal, peri-rectal or perineal specimens are not acceptable. A speculum should not 
be used for culture collection. 
• 
Place the swab(s) into a non-nutritive transport medium. Group B streptococci isolates can 
remain viable in transport media at room temperature for 1 day without risk of false-negative 
results. Specimen requisitions should clearly indicate the specimens are for group B streptococci 
culture. 
• 
Laboratories performing these cultures should ensure clinicians have continuous access to 
results 24 hours per day/7 days a week. 
• 
If group B streptococcal bacteria is detected any time during pregnancy, it should be treated.

Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) 
 
Couples should be educated about the natural history of genital HSV infection and should be advised that 
if either partner is infected, they should abstain from sexual contact while lesions are present. To 
minimize the risk of transmission, use of condoms is recommended for asymptomatic HSV-infected 
individuals. Susceptible pregnant women should avoid sexual contact during the last eight weeks of 
pregnancy if their partners have active genital HSV infections. 
 
Prior to delivery, women with a history of genital HSV should be asked about recent symptoms and 
should undergo careful examination of the perineum. Cesarean delivery is indicated for all women with 
active (primary and recurrent) genital HSV lesions at the time of delivery.

Glucose Tolerance Testing Guidelines and Management for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) 
 
Purpose 
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition that begins during pregnancy due to carbohydrate 
intolerance. GDM is one of the most common medical complications that occur during pregnancy. Women 
with GDM are at an increased risk of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery and 
possibly other potential morbidities. Infants born to mothers with GDM are at increased risk of 
macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, shoulder dystocia and cesarean delivery. 
          298
Prenatal 
JULY 2023 
 
 
Screening 
According to ACOG guidelines, all pregnant women should be screened for GDM, either by patient 
medical history, clinical risk factors or laboratory test results. Screening is generally performed at the 24- 
28 week prenatal visit, but early screening is recommended for women with risk factors. 
 
Early screening of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes is also suggested in women with the following risk 
factors: 
• 
A previous medical history of GDM 
• 
A known impaired glucose metabolism 
• 
Obesity (BMI>30) 
 
If GDM is not diagnosed, blood glucose testing should be repeated at the 24-28 week prenatal visit. 
Diagnostic Testing Procedures 
• 
The Glucose Challenge Test (GCT) entails the consumption of a 50-gram (commercially 
prepared) oral glucose load followed by a plasma or serum glucose sample determination one 
hour later. The glucose load is best tolerated when it is chilled and citrus rather than cola 
flavored (the glucose should be taken orally within 5 minutes). 
o 
The client does not need to be fasting for this test. 
o 
If the one-hour test is abnormal (>140-179mg/dl), a 100-gram diagnostic Oral Glucose 
Tolerance Test (OGTT) is performed. (If the 1 hour 50-gram load venous blood 
glucose is >180, do not proceed to the 3-hour OGTT – refer to physician). 
o 
Schedule 3-hour OGTT within 7 days. 
• 
The Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) is the diagnostic test for GDM. 
o 
It is recommended that the OGTT be performed in the morning after an overnight fast 
of at least 8 hours but no greater than 14 hours. At least 3 days of unrestricted diet 
(150 grams carbohydrate/day) and unrestricted activity (unless contraindicated) need 
to precede the test. 
o 
Women taking prescription medications should check with their health provider for 
specific instructions. 
o 
Women need to remain seated and not smoke during the test. 
o 
A finger stick (capillary) blood sample along with a fasting venous (plasma) blood 
sugar should be obtained prior to the administration of the commercially prepared 
glucose solution. 
o 
If the fasting capillary sample glucose level is >126mg/dl, do not administer oral 
glucose without consulting the client’s provider. The provider should determine 
whether to proceed with the 3-hour OGTT. 
o 
If the fasting capillary sample glucose level is below 126mg/dl proceed with the test. 
Venous blood samples are then collected at 1, 2, and 3-hour intervals. 
 
Diagnosis 
 
• 
According to ACOG guidelines, diagnosis of GDM can be determined by the result of a 100- 
gram, 3-hour OGTT. 
• 
Either plasma or serum glucose level established by Carpenter & Coustan or the plasma level 
designated by the National Diabetes Data Group is appropriate for use. 
• 
A definitive diagnosis of GDM requires that 2 or more thresholds be met or exceeded.

Primary Course for Pre-exposure Rabies Vaccination 
Rabies 
JULY 2023 
 
 
Two rabies vaccines are currently available in the United States, i.e., human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV, Imovax/Sanofi 
Pasteur)) and purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV, RabAvert/Bavarian Nordic)). For immune-competent persons, a 
primary course is a series of two 1-mL doses of HDCV or PCECV, given intramuscularly (IM). The initial dose is given on 
designated day 0. An additional dose of HDCV or PCECV is given on day 7. Rabies vaccine should always be given IM in 
the deltoid for adults and older children. The anterolateral thigh is an acceptable alternate site for small children. HDCV or 
PCECV should never be administered in the gluteal area since administration in this area results in lower neutralizing 
antibody titers. Rabies vaccine preparations for intra-dermal (ID) administration are no longer available in the United 
States. (1) 
          309
Post-VaccinationSerologic Testing 
Rabies 
JULY 2023 
 
 
 
Healthy persons who were tested 2–4 weeks after completion of pre-exposure rabies prophylaxis in accordance with ACIP 
guidelines have demonstrated an adequate antibody response to rabies. 
Therefore, no testing of patients completing pre-exposure prophylaxis is necessary to document seroconversion unless the 
person is immunosuppressed, or they fit one of the risk categories that recommend post-exposure titers. 
 
Preferably, persons who are immunosuppressed by disease or medications should postpone pre- exposure vaccinations 
and consider avoiding activities for which rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis is indicated. When that is not possible, 
immunosuppressed persons who are at risk for exposure to rabies should be vaccinated and their virus neutralizing 
antibody titers checked. In these cases, failures to seroconvert after the third dose of rabies vaccine should be managed in 
consultation with the State Public Health Veterinarian, or DPH physicians. 
For adequate seroconversion, specimens should be collected after pre-exposure prophylaxis according to Table 1. An 
adequate title is considered to be >0.5 IU/ml, a titer less than that, a booster vaccination should be provided. 
 
Pre-Exposure Booster Doses of Vaccine (Table 1) 
Persons who work with rabies virus in research laboratories or vaccine production facilities or performing testing for rabies 
in diagnostic laboratories (elevated risk for unrecognized and recognized exposures including unusual or high-risk 
exposures, risk category [Table 1]) are at the highest risk for inapparent exposures. Such persons should have a serum 
sample tested for rabies virus neutralizing antibody every 6 months. An IM booster dose of vaccine should be administered 
if the serum titer < 0.5 IU/ml. 
 
Category 2: Elevated risk for unrecognized and recognized exposures, includes, persons who frequently handle bats, have 
contact with bats, enter high-density bat environments perform animal necropsies. This category also includes persons 
who frequently handle bats, regardless of location in the United States or throughout the world, because of the existence of 
lyssaviruses on all continents except Antarctica. Persons in this category should have a serum sample tested for rabies 
virus neutralizing antibody every 2 years. If the titer is less than <0.5 IU/ml, the person also should receive a single booster 
dose of vaccine. 
 
Risk category 3 includes persons who interact with animals that could be rabid, occupational, or recreational activities that 
typically involve contact with animals to include: veterinarians, veterinary students, and terrestrial animal-control and 
wildlife officers working in areas where rabies is uncommon to rare (infrequent exposure group), persons who handle 
wildlife reservoir species (wildlife biologists, rehabilitators and trappers) and spelunkers. and certain at-risk international 
travelers performing occupational or recreational activities that increase risk for exposure to potentially rabid animals 
(especially canines) or who might have difficulty getting prompt access to safe PEP. They should complete the 2 dose 
(days 1 and 7) pre-exposure vaccination series with licensed vaccines and according to ACIP schedule do not require 
routine serologic verification of detectable antibody titers or routine pre-exposure booster doses of vaccine. If they are 
exposed to rabies in the future, they are considered immunologically primed against rabies and simply require 
postexposure prophylaxis for a person previously vaccinated (i.e., days 0 and 3 vaccination) (1). 
 
Risk category 4 includes the same persons as risk category 3, but for a short term of exposure, such as a volunteer 
providing hands-on animal care or infrequent traveler with risk anticipated to be 3 years or less. No titers or boosters are 
recommended. 
 
Risk category 5 is for the typical person living in the United States. No risk to rabies is anticipated and no pre-exposure 
vaccines or titers are recommended.

RABIESPOSTEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS 
 
The decision to administer rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is based on several factors related to the potential 
exposure to rabies virus. These factors include the type of exposure (i.e., bite or non-bite), the species of animal involved, if 
the bite was provoked, and the epidemiology of rabies in a specific geographic area. An enclosed algorithm serves as a 
guide to indications for PEP. The environmentalist in your health department is usually quite familiar with these factors and 
the circumstances involving a potential exposure and should be regarded as a local resource for determining if PEP is 
indicated. Ultimately, the decision to administer PEP is between the patient and their physician. The local health 
department must have a physician’s order (phone order is acceptable) to administer PEP. Administering PEP is not 
difficult. 
 
Rabies is an incurable disease. Postexposure prophylaxis is a rabies prevention strategy, not a rabies treatment. 
Prevention strategies for rabies consist of three steps: 
 
1. Immediate and thorough washing of the exposed site/wound, 
2. Administration of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) for immediate passive immunity, and 
3. Administration of multiple doses of rabies vaccine for active immunity. 
 
Local Wound Treatment 
 
The immediate and thorough washing of bite wounds, scratches, and mucous membranes exposed to rabies virus with 
soap and water has been shown to markedly decrease the likelihood of rabies. If available, a virucidal agent (e.g., 
povidine-iodine solution) should be used to irrigate the wounds. 
Tetanus prophylaxis should be administered by protocol if indicated. Measures to control bacterial infection and indications 
for surgical intervention (suturing) are decisions for the physician. 
 
Human Rabies Immune Globulin Usage 
 
Human Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG) is administered only once (at the beginning of rabies postexposure prophylaxis) to 
provide immediate antibodies until the patient responds to rabies vaccine by actively producing antibodies. Previously 
vaccinated individuals do not receive HRIG. If HRIG is not given at the same time vaccination is begun, it can be given 
through the seventh day after the administration of the first dose of vaccine. HRIG is not given beyond the seventh day 
since an antibody response to the vaccine is presumed to have occurred. The dose of HRIG is 20 IU/kg (approximately 
0.06 mL/lb of HRIG containing 150 IU/mL). The current recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices (ACIP) is for the entire dose to be infiltrated around and into the wound(s) if anatomically feasible. If none or only 
part of the HRIG is used for infiltration, the remaining volume should be administered at an anatomical site (intramuscular 
[IM]) distant from vaccine administration. HRIG should never be administered in the same syringe or into the same 
anatomic site as rabies vaccine. 
Vaccine Usage 
Unvaccinated Persons 
For unvaccinated persons, the combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, 
regardless of the time interval between exposure and initiation of PEP. If PEP has been initiated and appropriate laboratory 
diagnostic testing (i.e., the direct fluorescent antibody test) indicates that the animal that caused the exposure was not 
rabid, PEP may be discontinued. 
 
Two rabies vaccines are currently available in the United States, purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV) and the 
human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV). For immune-competent persons, a regimen of four 1-mL doses of PCECV or HDCV is 
given intramuscularly. The first dose is given as soon as it is determined that PEP is indicated. This initial dose is given on 
designated day 0. HRIG is usually administered at the same time as described above. Additional doses of PCECV or 
HDCV are given on day 3, day 7 and day 14 after the first vaccination. The vaccine should always be given IM in the 
deltoid for adults and older children. The anterolateral thigh is an acceptable alternate site for small children. PCECV or 
HDCV should never be administered in the gluteal area since administration in this area results in lower neutralizing 
antibody titers. All immunosuppressed individuals such as, but not limited to, organ transplant patients, asplenic individuals, 
treated individuals with any auto- immune disorder, HIV positive individuals should receive five postexposure doses on day 
0, day 3, day 7, day 14 and day 21 or day 28. If rabies exposure occurred outside of the United States and in an area of 
endemic canine rabies, a 5th rabies vaccine on day 21 or 28 is recommended.

PreviouslyVaccinated Persons 
Previously vaccinated persons are those with a history of preexposure vaccination with HDCV, PCECV, or rabies 
vaccine adsorbed (RVA); prior PEP with HDCV, PCECV or RVA, or previous vaccination with any other type of rabies 
vaccine and a documented history of antibody response to prior vaccination. Previously vaccinated persons should 
receive two vaccine doses, (1-mL of PCECV or HDCV administered IM in the deltoid on days 0 and 3 only). 
Administration of HRIG is unnecessary, and HRIG should not be administered to previously vaccinated persons to avoid 
possible inhibition of the relative strength or rapidity of an expected anamnestic response. Local wound care remains an 
important part of rabies PEP for any previously vaccinated persons. 
 
Postvaccination Serologic Testing 
Because the antibody response after the recommended postexposure vaccination regimen with PCECV or HDCV has 
been satisfactory, routine postvaccination serologic testing is not recommended for healthy persons to document 
seroconversion. Serologic testing is only indicated in unusual circumstances, as when the patient is known to be 
immunosuppressed. When titers are obtained, serum specimens collected 1--2 weeks after prophylaxis (after last dose of 
vaccine) should be <0.5 IU/ml.

What to do when the vaccine schedule is interrupted or is off schedule: 
 
1. The series does not need to be reinitiated because of minor interruptions of the vaccine 
schedule-just pick up at the point it was discontinued, maintaining the proper intervals 
between doses specified in the schedule. 
 
2. Example: if the day 7 vaccination was given on the 10th day, the next shot would be given on day 17 
instead of day 14, maintaining the 7-day interval between the 3rd and 4th shot of the series. 
3. If major deviations occur, and for all immunosuppressed individuals, test antibody titers 2 weeks 
after completing the series (a rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test that demonstrates complete virus 
neutralization at a serum dilution of 1:5 is considered to be indicative of protection) is recommended.

NOTES 
1. 
Rabies risk assessment requires balancinga numberofcriteria:the species ofanimal and theendemicity of rabies for 
that species in Kentucky, the observed health and behaviorof the animal, and thecircumstances of the bite. 
2. 
This algorithm onlyaddresses rabiespost-exposure prophylaxis.Othertreatment such as wound care, 
antibiotics, and tetanus immunization may be indicated. 
3. 
In addition to obvious s bites or mucous membrane exposures, the CDC suggests that PEP be considered in cases 
where there is a reasonable probability that contact with a bat may have occurred (i.e. a sleeping person 
awakens to find a bat in thesame room, an adultwitnesses a bat in a room with a previously unattended child, 
mentally disabled person, or intoxicated individual) and rabies cannot be ruled out by testing of the bat. PEP 
would not be warranted or other household members. 
4. 
Barring unusual circumstances, rodents and rabbits are not considered at-risk species. In questionable or 
unusual circumstances involving rodent, rabbits, and livestock bites, consult the local/state health 
department.Rabies ispredominantly adiseaseofcarnivorous animals (animalsthateatother animals)whilecarrion 
eaters like the opossum who eat dead or decaying flesh are seldom affected. Consultation with the state health 
departmentis strongly recommendedfor opossum human bites on rabies Post Exposure Prophylaxis. 
5. 
Provoked exposures may include attempting to feed an animal, entering an animal’s territory, petting or playing with 
an animal, handling an animal, attempting to break up a fight between animals, having contact with an injured 
animal, and walking, running, or riding a bicycle past an animal. Unprovoked exposures are rare and typically 
require an animal to cross neutralspace and attack. The physicianshould attempt to get the patient to describethe 
scenarioin orderto establishthe true natureorthecircumstancessurrounding the biting incident – DO NOT simply 
ask if the bite was provoked or unprovoked. 
6. 
The severity andlocation of a wound (severe wounds or obvious wounds near the headand neck should be given 
highest priority), and the expected interval between the time of the bite and receipt of rabies test results 
should be considered when making a decision to begin PEP while awaiting test results. 
7. 
Unless the person previously received rabies immunoprophylaxis, PEP consists of four (4) doses of vaccine (1.0 
mL each administered IM in the deltoid region) on days 0, 3, 7 and 14 and one (1) dose of human rabies 
immune globulin (HRIG)administered on day 0,infiltrated into and around the bite wound as much as 
anatomically feasible, with the remainder administered IM at an anatomical site distant from vaccine 
administration. HRIG should not be administered in the same syringe or at the same site as vaccine. HRIG 
dosage is based on the weight of the patient, 20 IU/kg, and should not be given in more than the 
recommended dose, as it may suppress active production of antibody. Apreviously vaccinated person needs 
an abbreviatedPEP schedule, specifically day 0 and day 3. Immunocompromised individuals should receive the 
5 seriesof immunizations on days 0, 3, 7, 14-21 and 28 in addition to HRIG on day 0. Contact the health 
department for the schedule, if needed. 
8. 
Ifthe biting animal is captured and tests negative forrabies afterPEP has begun, PEP may be discontinued.

KENTUCKY DEPARTMENT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL FOR BRONCHODILATOR RESCUE INHALER (BRI) 
IN THE SCHOOL SETTING 
Background 
KRS 158.836 statute.aspx (ky.gov)makes provisions for students with asthma symptoms or 
respiratory distress to have access to a bronchodilator rescue inhaler (BRI) in school. 
•
A student who has a documented life-threatening asthma symptoms or respiratory distress shall
have:
a)
A BRI provided by his or her parent or guardian in his or her possession or in the possession
of the school nurse, school administrator, or his or her designee in all school environments
that the student may be in.
b)
A written individual health care plan in place for the prevention and proactive management for
the student in all school environments that the student may be in. The individual health care
plan may be incorporated in the student’s individualized education program or student’s 504
plan.
•
Each school is encouraged to keep a BRI in a minimum of two (2) locations in the school,
including but not limited to the school office and athletic office so it may be administered to any
student believed to be having asthma symptoms or respiratory distress. To minimize the spread
of disease, the BRI’s and spacers, if applicable, shall be used for one individual student and are
not to be shared with any other student.
Stock BRIs 
•
Schools electing to keep stock BRI’s to use for students without documented asthma symptoms
or respiratory distress, shall maintain stock BRI's in a secure, accessible, but unlocked location.
This shall apply to the extent that the BRI’s are donated to a school, or a school has sufficient
funding to purchase them. BRI’s may only be purchased with a prescription from a medical
provider or pharmacist who may dispense per KRS 311.646 statute.aspx (ky.gov). The
school nurse or designee shall check the expiration date monthly and obtain a new prescription
for replacement medication prior to expiration date.
•
Each school electing to keep BRI’s shall implement policies and procedures for managing
student’s asthma symptoms / respiratory distress reaction developed and approved by the local
school board.
•
Clinical protocols shall be developed by the Kentucky Department for Public Health to address
BRI’s kept by schools and to advise on clinical administration of BRI’s.
•
Any individual or entity who, in good faith and without compensation, renders emergency care or
treatment by the use of a bronchodilator rescue inhaler shall be immune from civil liability for any
personal injury as a result of the care or treatment, or as a result of any act or failure to act in
providing or arranging further medical treatment, if the person acts as an ordinary, reasonable
prudent person would have acted under the same or similar circumstances.
•
The Department for Public Health, the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure, the Kentucky Board
of Nursing, the American Red Cross, or other training programs approved by the Department for
Public Health may conduct in-person or on-line training for administering lifesaving treatment to
persons believed in good faith to be experiencing severe allergic reactions and asthma symptoms
or respiratory distress and issue a certificate of training to persons completing the training. The
training shall include instructions for recognizing the symptoms of anaphylaxis and asthma and
administering an injectable epinephrine device or a bronchodilator rescue inhaler.
ASTHMA means a respiratory condition marked by coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath or chest 
tightness. Other symptoms may include struggling to breath, nasal flaring, increased breathing rate, blue 
or dusky lips/nail beds, agitation, or difficulty speaking.

ACTION STEPS FOR STAFF TO MANAGE AN ASTHMA ATTACK 
Act fast! Warning signs and symptoms—such as coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing, chest 
tightness or pressure, and low or falling peak flow readings—can worsen quickly and even become life 
threatening. They require quick action. 
1. Quickly assess the situation.
•
Call 911 or your local emergency service right away if the student is struggling to breathe,
talk, or stay awake; has blue lips or fingernails; or asks for an ambulance.
•
If accessible, use a peak flow meter to measure the student’s lung function.
2. Get help, but never leave the student alone. Have an adult accompany the student to the health
room or send for help from the school nurse or designee. Do not wait.
3. Stop activity. Help the student stay calm and comfortable.
•
If the asthma attack began after exposure to an allergen or irritant (such as furry animals,
fresh cut grass, strong odors, or pollen) remove the student from the allergen or irritant,
if possible.
          456

4. Treat symptoms. Help the student locate and use his or her bronchodilator rescue inhaler (BRI)
with a spacer or holding chamber (if available) or use the stock bronchodilator rescue inhaler (BRI).
•
Many students carry their medicine and can self-manage asthma attacks. They should follow their
health care 
provider instructions. For student without specific orders on file use the school
policies and procedures to administer stock BRI provided by the medical director. Provide support
as needed.
5. Call the parent or guardian.
6. Repeat use of quick-relief inhaler per MD order / policy or if—
•
Symptoms continue or return.
•
Student still has trouble breathing; or
•
Peak flow reading is below 80% of student’s personal best peak flow number on asthma action
plan.

AUTO-INJECTORS IN THE SCHOOL SETTING 
Background 
KRS 158.836 makes provisions for students with life-threatening allergies to have access to an 
epinephrine auto-injector in school, and KRS 158.832 clarifies definitions. KRS158.836 includes: 
•
A student who has a documented life-threatening allergy shall have:
a)
An epinephrine auto-injector provided by his or her parent or guardian in his or her
possession or in the possession of the school nurse, school administrator, or his or her
designee in all school environments that the student may be in.
b)
A written individual health care plan in place for the prevention and proactive management for

in the school so that epinephrine may be administered to any student believed to be having a life- 
threatening allergic or anaphylactic reaction.
•
Schools electing to keep epinephrine auto-injectors shall maintain them in a secure, accessible,
but unlocked location. This shall apply to the extent that the epinephrine auto-injectors are
donated to a school, or a school has sufficient funding to purchase the epinephrine auto-injectors.
Epinephrine auto-injectors may only be purchased with a prescription from a medical provider
or pharmacist who may dispense per KRS 311.646 statute.aspx (ky.gov)..
•
Each school electing to keep epinephrine auto-injectors shall implement policies and procedures

auto-injectors.
Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur quickly and can cause death within 
minutes. In some instances, signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis can occur up to a few hours after 
exposure to the allergen. 
Common triggers for an anaphylaxis include food (particularly peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, soy, milk, 
wheat or eggs); stinging insects (such as wasps or bees); medications, latex, animal dander or exercise. 
Signs and Symptoms of Anaphylaxis 
Signs and Symptoms of anaphylaxis may include, but are not limited to: 
•
Mouth: tingling, itching, swelling of the tongue, lips, or mouth; blue/gray color of the lips
•
Throat: tightening of throat, tickling feeling in back of throat, hoarseness or change in voice
•
Nose/Eyes/Ears: runny, itchy nose; redness and/or swelling of eyes; throbbing in ears
•
Lung: shortness of breath, repetitive shallow cough, wheezing
•
Stomach: abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
•
Skin: itchy rash, hives, swelling of face or extremities, facial flushing, sweating
•
Heart: weak pulse; rapid pulse; palpitations; fainting; blueness of lips, face, or nail beds;
paleness; lightheadedness; sense of impending doom or loss of consciousness
***It is important to note that not all signs and symptoms may be present during anaphylaxis. 
          443
Appendix A - Epinephrine Auto-Injectors 
in the School Setting 
JULY 2023 
 
Since the severity of an allergic reaction is difficult to predict, the allergic response may rapidly progress 
to anaphylaxis. It is important for students with known severe allergies who are at risk of anaphylaxis to 
have an Allergy or Anaphylaxis Emergency Action Plan of Care. Epinephrine should be administered 
promptly at the first sign of anaphylaxis. It is safer to administer epinephrine than to delay 
treatment for anaphylaxis. 
Epinephrine should be stored at room temperature (between 59-86 degrees F) in a dark area. The 
epinephrine should be checked monthly to ensure proper storage, expiration date, and medication 
stability. Expired auto-injectors or those with discolored solution or solid particles should not be used. 
Discard them in a sharps container. Personnel should be familiar with the type of epinephrine auto 
injector maintained by the school and its use. 
Responding to Anaphylaxis 
This is a life and death decision. Act promptly. 
Go to the student. Never send a student to the health room alone or leave a student alone. Do not move 
a student who is in severe distress. 
A.
For a student with specific orders on file (written individual health plan), follow the student’s
individually prescribed emergency action plan as it relates to a known life-threatening allergy
and/or known history of anaphylaxis. Note: For some students with known potential for life- 
threatening allergic reactions, the individual health plan may call for administration of epinephrine by
auto-injector after exposure to a known allergen and before symptoms of anaphylaxis may be
present.
B.
For a student without specific orders on file:
1.
Based on symptoms observed, determine that an anaphylactic reaction is occurring.
2.
Act quickly. Only a few symptoms may be present. The severity of symptoms can change rapidly.
3.
Place student on his/her back if possible. Do not give anything by mouth if the individual is
unconscious or unable to swallow.
4.
Determine the proper dose of epinephrine.
Dosages for epinephrine auto-injection:
a. If the child weighs 33 (15 kg) to 66 pounds (30kg), administer 0.15 mg of epinephrine
(junior size auto-injector.)
b. If the child is 66 pounds (30kg) or over, administer 0.30 mg of epinephrine
(regular size auto-injector.)
5.
Remove colored safety cap and INJECT EPINEPHRINE IMMEDIATELY into outside of mid- 
thigh (through clothing if necessary), press firmly and hold for 10 seconds for most
brands of auto-injectors, such as the EpiPen Auto-Injector, but only 5 seconds for the
Auvi-Q auto-injector. Note the time that the epinephrine is administered. For questions
regarding dosage or timing of the auto injector brand being used, please see product
instructions developed by the manufacturer.
6.
Call 911 or direct someone to call 911 to request immediate medical assistance. Advise the
911 operator that anaphylaxis is suspected, and that epinephrine has been given or is being
given.
7.
Direct someone to call the school nurse or front office.
8.
Direct someone to notify the child’s parents.
          444
Appendix A - Epinephrine Auto-Injectors 
in the School Setting 
JULY 2023 
 
9.
Begin monitoring airway and breathing. For a severe reaction consider keeping student lying on
back with legs raised.
10. Remain with student and reassure him or her as needed.
11. A second dose of auto-injectable epinephrine may be given 5 minutes or more after the first if
symptoms persist or recur.
12. Administer CPR if needed.
13. Document student’s name, date and time epinephrine was administered on the used epinephrine
auto-injector and give to Emergency Medical Services (EMS), when EMS arrives, so that the
information will accompany the student to the emergency department.
14. Even if symptoms subside or go away, EMS must still be summoned to respond, and the student
must be evaluated by a physician. A delayed or secondary reaction may occur up to several
hours later.
15. Document the incident and complete school incident report.
16. Replace epinephrine stock medication as appropriate.

Naloxone in the School Setting 
    1  
 October 2023 
Background 
KRS 217.186 Definition -- Provider prescribing or dispensing opioid antagonist -- states that the board 
of each local public school district and the governing body of each private and parochial school or 
school district may permit a school to keep naloxone on the premises and regulate the administration 
of naloxone to any individual suffering from an apparent opiate-related overdose.  
KRS 217.186 includes: 
1.
KDPH shall develop clinical protocols (medically approved guidelines) to address supplies of
naloxone including Over-the-Counter Naloxone Nasal Spray kept by the schools.
2.
A person or agency, including a school employee authorized to administer medication under
KRS 156.502 may:
a)
Receive a prescription for the drug naloxone.
b)
Possess naloxone pursuant to this subsection and any equipment
needed for its administration; and
c)
Administer naloxone to an individual suffering from an apparent opioid-related overdose.
3.
A person acting in good faith who administers naloxone received under KRS
217.186 shall be immune from criminal and civil liability for the administration unless
personal injury results from the gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct of
the person administering the drug.
•
Opioid overdose-related deaths can be prevented when naloxone is administered
in a timely manner. As an opioid antagonist, naloxone displaces opiates from
receptor sites in the brain and reverses respiratory depression, which usually is
the cause of overdose deaths. During the period of time when an overdose can
become fatal, respiratory depression can be reversed by giving the individual
naloxone. Naloxone should be administered promptly at the first sign of
opioid overdose. It is safer to administer naloxone than to delay treatment
for opioid overdose.
•
Each school is encouraged to ensure ready access to naloxone and keep it in a
minimum of two (2) locations in the school so that it may be administered to any
individual believed to be having a life-threatening opioid overdose.
•
Schools electing to keep naloxone shall maintain the drug in a secure,
accessible, but unlocked location. Naloxone may only be purchased with a
prescription from a medical provider or pharmacist who has met the
requirements and received certification from the Board of Pharmacy in
accordance with  201 KAR 2:360 Opioid antagonist dispensing.
•
Each school electing to keep naloxone shall implement policies and procedures
for managing opioid overdose, developed, and approved by the local school
board.
•
Administration of appropriate CPR measures may be needed if the individual
does not have respirations or a heartbeat.

5.
Over-the-Counter Naloxone 
The Kentucky Board of Nursing KBN AOS #16 Scope of Nursing Practice in the
Recommendation and Administration of Over-the-Counter (OTC) Medications states: 
a)
When a nurse, as an employee or volunteer of a healthcare delivery system, provides
non-prescription medication to an individual, the nurse should do so based on an order
from a qualified healthcare provider or medically approved guidelines to supply the non-    
          prescription medication. 
b)
An educationally prepared and clinically competent nurse, as an individual who is acting
outside a health delivery system, may choose to recommend or administer a non- 
                            prescription drug (in a pre-labeled, pre-packaged form) to a person whose condition 
      warrants it based on nursing assessment. 
c)
Nurses who make delegatory decisions regarding the performance of acts/tasks by others
are governed by 201 KAR 20:400 Delegation of nursing tasks.
WHAT ARE OPIOIDS? 
Opioids are drugs that alter the body’s perception of pain. These drugs are among our most important 
tools for treating chronic and acute pain. Opioids work by binding to specific receptors in the brain, 
spinal cord, and gastrointestinal tract. In doing so, they minimize the body’s perception of pain. 
However, stimulating the opioid receptors or “reward centers” in the brain can also trigger other 
systems of the body, such as those responsible for regulating mood, breathing, and blood pressure.  
Opioids work in the same part of the brain that controls breathing. Overloading the brain with too many 
opioids can slow down or shut down breathing and lead to death. 
Examples of opioids include: 
•
hydrocodone (Lortab, Norco)
•
morphine (MS Contin)
•
diacetylmorphine (Heroin)
•
oxycodone (OxyContin, Percocet)
•
oxymorphone (Opana)
•
hydromorphone (Dilaudid)
•
fentanyl (Duragesic, Sublimaze, Actiq)
o
Pharmaceutical or regulated fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 100 times more potent
than morphine. It is safe when administered as prescribed.
o
Fentanyl is increasingly found in the unregulated drug supply.
HOW DOES OVERDOSE OCCUR? 
A variety of effects can occur after a person takes opioids, ranging from pleasure to nausea, 
vomiting, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) and overdose, in which breathing and 
heartbeat slow or even stop. 
Since the onset and severity of an opioid overdose is difficult to predict, the overdose may 
rapidly progress to respiratory depression. In some instances, signs and symptoms of an 
opioid overdose may appear as an individual experiencing extreme sleepiness or having 
breathing difficulties. Naloxone should be administered promptly at the first sign of an 
opioid overdose.

WHO MAY BE AT RISK? 
 
The following clinical factors may increase a patient's risk for overdose when taking an opioid. 
• 
Using again after taking a break, a person who has recently gone through opioid 
withdrawal has decreased opioid tolerance and can overdose very easily.  
 This applies especially to people who have recently been in treatment, 
recovery, or have been incarcerated. 
• 
Anyone who uses opioids for long-term management of chronic cancer or non-
cancer pain is at risk for opioid overdose. 
• 
Substance abuse, dependence, and/or addiction, as are persons who use unregulated drugs. 
• 
Accidental exposure and unintentional opioid use 
 Includes members of a patient’s household who may discover and use the 
prescribed opioid inappropriately. 
 Unregulated fentanyl may be found in drugs such as cocaine, meth, or in 
counterfeit pills. 
• 
A morphine-equivalent dose (MED) ≥20 mg per day 
• 
Switching to another opioid 
• 
Chronic pulmonary disease 
• 
Sleep apnea 
• 
Asthma 
• 
Chronic kidney and/or liver impairment 
• 
Use of CNS depressants, including benzodiazepines and alcohol 
• 
Use of certain medications for depression, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) 
 
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF OPIOID OVERDOSE 
 
All school staff, including those in extracurricular programs, should be trained on how to 
recognize the signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose requiring the use of naloxone.  
Symptoms of an opioid overdose requiring the use of naloxone may include but are not 
limited to the following:  
• 
Extreme sleepiness, very difficult or unable to wake up. 
• 
Inability to talk.  
• 
Slow heartbeat and or low blood pressure 
• 
Small pinpoint pupils 
• 
Slow breathing with respirations less than 10 times per minute 
• 
Shallow breathing and/or making snoring, gurgling, or rattling sounds. 
• 
Pale skin, cool and clammy to the touch 
• 
Fingernails or lips may be grey, blue, or purple. 
 
It is important to note that not all signs and symptoms may be present during an opioid 
overdose. If the individual is not responsive to shaking, yelling, or vigorously rubbing their 
sternum, ACT PROMPTLY!! 
 
 CALL FOR HELP! 
 CHECK FOR BREATHING! 
 CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY! 
 GET THE NALOXONE!

The steps for rescue breathing are:  
 
1) Kneel beside the person.  Place the person on their back on a firm, flat surface. 
2) Open the airway to a past-neutral position using the head-tilt/chin-lift technique. 
3) Pinch the nose shut, take a normal breath, and make complete seal over the person’s mouth 
with your mouth. 
4) Ensure each breath lasts about 1 second and makes the chest rise; allow air to exit before 
giving the next breath. 
5) Breathe again every 5 seconds until the patient is breathing on their own, or EMS arrives and 
takes over. 
 
Note: If the 1st breath does not cause the chest to rise, retilt the head and ensure a proper 
seal before giving the second breath. If the 2nd breath does not make the chest rise, an 
object may be blocking the airway.   
 
                                                            
CPR Steps | Perform CPR | Red Cross 
 
RESPONDING TO AN OPIOID OVERDOSE  
 
ACT FAST!! Always go with a distressed individual. Never send the individual to the health 
room/school nurse alone or leave them alone. Do not move an individual who is in severe 
distress. 
 
Suspected opioid poisoning. 
1. • Check for responsiveness.  
2. • Shout for nearby help.  
3. • Activate the emergency response system (call 911).  
4. • Get naloxone and an AED if available.  
 
 If the person is breathing normally prevent deterioration by: 
• 
Tap and shout. 
• 
Reposition. 
• 
Consider naloxone. 
• 
Continue until EMS arrives.  
 
If the person is NOT breathing normally (shallow, infrequent breathing) or not breathing: 
Start CPR 
 • Give naloxone. 
 • Use an AED. 
 • Resume CPR until EMS arrives.  
 
Note: For adult and adolescent victims, responders should perform compressions and rescue breaths for 
opioid associated emergencies if they are trained and perform Hands-Only CPR if not trained to perform 
rescue breaths. For infants and children, CPR should include compressions with rescue breaths.

Most patients respond by returning to spontaneous breathing with minimal withdrawal symptoms. 
The response generally occurs within 2 to 3 minutes after naloxone administration. Rescue 
breathing should continue while waiting for the naloxone to take effect. Wait at least 2 minutes for 
a response before giving another dose. 
 
Naloxone will continue to work for as long as 30 to 90 minutes, but after that time, overdose 
symptoms may return. ASSURE 911 HAS BEEN CALLED and that EMS was activated. If no one 
has yet called 911, IMMEDIATELY CALL 911. 
A person may remain unconscious if non-opioid drugs have been taken or if they have 
experienced another medical emergency such as: 
• 
Traumatic brain Injury 
• 
Stroke 
• 
Diabetes 
• 
Infection 
• 
Heart attack 
• 
Seizures 
 
2. 
DIRECT SOMEONE TO CALL AND NOTIFY THE FRONT OFFICE AND THE SCHOOL NURSE 
 
If the individual is breathing on their own, place them in the recovery position. 
After giving naloxone, stay with the 
individual. If they are breathing on 
their own, to decrease the 
individual’s chance of choking on 
their vomit, place them in the 
recovery position on their side, and 
support the body with one bent knee 
with the face turned to the side. 
 
3. 
STAY WITH THE PERSON AND 
MONITOR FOR RESPIRATORY 
DISTRESS 
 
Provide rescue breathing as necessary. 
It is necessary to seek immediate 
emergency medical assistance (911) 
after delivering the first dose of 
naloxone, keep the patient under 
continued surveillance, and repeat 
doses of naloxone as necessary. 
4. REPEAT NALOXONE ADMINISTRATION IF SYMPTOMS CONTINUE. 
 
 If the person is not effectively breathing 2-3 minutes after the first dose, administer a second 
dose in the other nostril. 
 Resume rescue breathing and continue giving naloxone every 2-3 minutes until: 
o 
Effective breathing resumes, 
o 
EMS arrives, 
o 
No more naloxone is available.

5. DOCUMENT  
 
Name, date, time, and route the naloxone was administered and give this information to EMS so that the 
information will accompany the individual to the hospital’s emergency department. 
• 
Document the incident and complete school incident report. 
• 
Replace naloxone in-stock medication as appropriate as soon as possible. 
 
NALOXONE 
 
Naloxone comes in two FDA-approved forms: injectable and over-the-counter prepackaged 
nasal spray. No matter what dosage form you use, it’s important to receive training on how and 
when to use naloxone. You should also read the product instructions and check the expiration 
date. 
1. Injectable brands of naloxone are offered by different companies listed in the FDA 
Orange Book under “naloxone” (look for “injectable”). Typically, the proper dose must 
be drawn up from a vial. Usually, it is injected with a needle into the muscle, although it 
also may be administered into a vein or under the skin. 
2. Prepackaged Nasal Spray (generic naloxone, Narcan®, Kloxxado®), is an FDA-
approved prefilled, needle-free device that requires no assembly and is sprayed into one 
nostril while the person lays on their back. This device can also be easier for loved ones 
and bystanders without formal training to use. 
 
Current drug products approved by the FDA may be found here: Orange Book: Approved Drug 
Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (fda.gov) 
 
FDA Approves First Over-the-Counter Naloxone Nasal Spray | FDA 
 
For questions regarding the dosage or timing of the brand being used, please see the product package 
insert instructions developed by the manufacturer. 
 
INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
 
Naloxone is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected 
opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. 
Naloxone is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where 
opioids may be present. Naloxone is not a substitute for emergency medical care. When in 
doubt, if an individual is unresponsive and an opioid overdose is suspected, administer naloxone 
as quickly as possible because prolonged respiratory depression may result in damage to the 
central nervous system or death. Call 911 to activate EMS immediately after administering the 
first dose of naloxone. 
 
HOW NALOXONE IS SUPPLIED 
 
Naloxone can be supplied as an intramuscular (IM) injection or as an intranasal (IN) spray. Both 
formulations are effective. The intranasal formulation can be dispensed as a commercially available 
product or a kit that requires assembly. In many cases, the commercially produced naloxone nasal 
spray may be preferred by patients and caregivers due to cost and ease of 
assembly/administration. There is also an IM autoinjector. Pharmacists should note that dosing and 
administration instructions vary among the formulations.

STORAGE AND HANDLING OF NALOXONE 
 
• 
Store naloxone in an easily accessible place in the original package at room temperature. 
Avoid light exposure. 
• 
The shelf life of naloxone is generally 12 to 18 months. If stored properly, naloxone should be 
effective until at least the expiration date on the packaging. 
• 
Do not insert naloxone into the prefilled syringe until ready to use. Once inserted, it expires 
within 2 weeks. 
• 
Monitor the expiration date on naloxone and replace it before it expires. When there are no 
other alternatives, expired naloxone can be administered but may not be as effective.

Males and Females 
LABORATORY 
Note: 
Routine laboratory tests shall be obtained 
at each STD visit. An STD visit is defined 
as a visit in which the patient presents with 
new symptoms, new exposure, partner 
problem, positive test and/or high-risk 
behavior. 
Obtain blood specimens from all patients 
for Syphilis IGG (if using the Kentucky 
Division of Laboratory Services) and VDRL 
(Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) 
or RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) at each 
visit except for those patients who have 
had a documented non-reactive Syphilis 
test within the past 30 days. Patients 
presenting with symptoms suggestive of 
syphilis or who are epidemiologically 
related to another person with syphilis 
should have a syphilis test regardless of 
documentation of testing within the last 30 
days. For patients presenting with lesion(s) 
suggestive of syphilis, a confirmatory test 
should be requested if using a non-state 
laboratory. Confirmatory tests for syphilis 
are IGG, TPPA and FTA. 
• Obtain specimen for Chlamydia and 
gonorrhea (CT/GC APTIMA Test). 
Except in pregnant women, a test of cure 
for chlamydia is not recommended for 
persons treated with the recommended or 
alternative regimens, unless therapeutic 
compliance is in question symptoms 
persist, or re-infection is suspected. 
Testing in less than 3 weeks after 
completion of therapy could yield a false 
positive result due to the presence of dead 
CT organisms. Test of cure is also not 
recommended routinely for patients with 
uncomplicated gonorrhea who have been 
treated with the recommended regimens. 
Patients with persistent symptoms or 
whose symptoms recur shortly after 
treatment should be reevaluated, 
preferably by culture; positive isolates 
should undergo antimicrobial susceptibility 
testing. 
• Obtain blood or oral specimens for HIV 
testing from all patients seeking STD 
services except for those patients who 
have a documented negative HIV test 
within the past 90 days or if the patient 
declines. 
Repeat labs per medical/sexual 
history and risk assessment. 
(Note: Testing for Chlamydia less 
than 3 weeks from date of 
treatment may result in a positive 
result which may represent 
nonviable Chlamydia remnants 
from an earlier infection)

Males and Females 
• Obtain blood specimens for HCV testing from 
all patients seeking STD services. Please 
refer to HCV Matrix 1 - Collection and 
Handling Guidance and HCV Matrix 2 - 
Screening and Referral Guidance. 
Stat Testing (Dependent upon availability 
at the LHD) 
Stat RPRs for syphilis, if available, should 
be ordered on patients with ANY of the 
following: 
• 
Genital lesion(s) 
• 
Rash suggestive of syphilis 
• 
Epidemiological link to another 
person with syphilis 
• 
History of lesions or 
lymphadenopathy since last 
negative serologic test for syphilis 
(STS). 
If stat RPR is not available and the patient 
has a lesion(s), obtain a blood specimen 
for Syphilis IGG (if using the Division of 
Laboratory Services). If using a lab that 
does not use reverse syphilis testing, order 
a VDRL or RPR plus request confirmatory 
testing such as IGG, TPPA, or FTA. (A 
negative VDRL or RPR with clinical 
symptoms suggestive of primary syphilis 
such as a lesion(s) does not rule out 
syphilis). Repeat screening for primary 
disease may require additional testing at 2- 
4 weeks but should not impede empiric 
treatment if symptoms are highly 
suggestive of syphilis. For specimens 
submitted to Kentucky’s Division of 
Laboratory Services, reflexive confirmatory 
testing will follow the current CDC 
Guidelines (VDRL and TPPA as indicated 
for positive results). 
Gram stain for gonorrhea, if available, 
should be ordered on male patients who 
present with ANY of the following: 
• 
Penile Discharge 
•

REQUIREMENTS FOR STD 
• 
Assure that patients with positive Chlamydia and/or gonorrhea tests return for treatment within 
seven (7) days of receipt of laboratory report. The STD Program goal is to provide treatment to 
85% of infected patients within 14 days of specimen collection and to 90% within 30 days of 
specimen collection. 
• 
Provide counseling/interviewing to public health clinic patients diagnosed with Chlamydia, 
gonorrhea, NGU or Mucopurulent Cervicitis. Interviews should be achieved in a timely manner, 
with the goal of obtaining an average of at least one contact elicited per case interviewed. This 
service should be available to privately diagnosed and treated patients upon request of their 
physician. Although infected patients are under no legal obligation to participate in partner 
services, every effort should be made to motivate the patient to engage in partner services to 
ensure that exposed partners are identified, notified and provided adequate exam and treatment 
services. 
• 
Assure that contacts to syphilis, HIV, Chlamydia, gonorrhea, NGU, Mucopurulent Cervicitis named 
in interviews with infected patients are referred for medical evaluation in a timely manner. 
• 
Assure that DIS priority referrals are “fast tracked” within the LHD STD clinic. 
• 
Assure reporting of suspected sexual abuse to the Department for Community-Based Services. 
• 
Provide all patients with counseling and/or printed materials, and motivate patients to: 
• Increase patients’ awareness of signs and symptoms of STDs and prompt patient to seek 
medical care immediately should evidence of symptoms occurs. 
• Increase the number of sexual partners referred for evaluation by STD patients. 
• Increase patients’ rate of compliance with prescribed medication regimens. 
• Increase the practice of preventive behaviors in the patient population (e.g., use of condoms, 
selection of partners, etc.). 
• 
Request area DIS for epidemiologic follow-up for 100% of suspected or diagnosed cases of 
priority STD (early syphilis and HIV infection).

Guidance for Delivering Expedited Partner Therapy 
Goal: 
To reduce the risk of re-infection among persons treated for gonorrhea and chlamydia, prevent disease 
complications, and reduce transmission to un-infected persons. 
Objective: 
To implement expedited partner therapy (EPT) to the sex partners of persons with gonorrhea and 
chlamydia without an intervening medical evaluation or professional prevention counseling. 
Background: 
Most health care providers advise their patients with STDs to notify their sex partners. The CDC 
estimates the proportion of partners who seek evaluation and treatment in response to patient referral 
ranges from 29% to 59%. In addition, because of limited staff and resources, partners of patients 
diagnosed with gonorrhea or chlamydia are less likely to be contacted and treated by public health 
personnel. In Kentucky, health departments rarely actively pursue partners of index patients with 
gonorrhea or chlamydia. 
The ideal approach for the partner(s) of a patient diagnosed with any STD is to be evaluated, examined, 
tested, counseled, and treated by a medical provider. However, this approach is not always feasible. EPT 
is the clinical practice of treating partners of patients diagnosed with gonorrhea or chlamydia without an 
intervening medical evaluation or professional prevention counseling. The usual implementation of EPT 
is where patients deliver medications or prescriptions to their sexual partner(s). (However, if their sex 
partner accompanies a patient diagnosed with gonorrhea and/or chlamydia to their appointment, the 
provider should ensure the partner is examined, tested, and treated during that visit.) Other potential 
means to achieve EPT include prescriptive arrangements with cooperating pharmacies, retrieval of 
medication by partners at public health clinics, or delivery of medication to partners in non-clinical 
settings by public health workers. 
Several studies have shown that EPT is an effective option for treating gonorrheal and chlamydial 
infections in the sex partners of heterosexual patients, can prevent re-infection of an index patient, and 
slow/stop the transmission of disease to other uninfected partners. EPT also saves money by reducing 
more advanced disease, and it allows clinicians to treat more infected persons. 
Practical Issues in Providing EPT 
Special Populations 
1) Adolescents should be given high priority in partner management. This age group has the highest 
rates of infection of all age groups. 2) Full STD exams are preferred in men who have sex with men 
(MSM) because of the likely high prevalence of co-morbidities, including HIV infection and other STDs. 
3) Preventing re-infection in pregnant women is a high priority. If the partner is pregnant, every effort 
should be made to contact her for referral to pregnancy services and/or prenatal care. Rescreening 
pregnant patients for CT in 3-4 weeks after treatment should be emphasized. 
Missed Opportunities 
Potential pitfalls of using EPT include: 1) inability to diagnose and treat co-infection that would be 
detected by personal evaluation of the partner(s), 2) missing complications of infection (e.g., PID, 
          329
STD 
JULY 2023 
 
 
 
Guidance for Delivering Expedited Partner Therapy 
 
pregnancy, testicular pain, abdominal pain, fever, etc.), 3) lack of risk reduction counseling, 4) inability to 
evaluate the risk of sexual abuse. 
 
Cost of Providing EPT 
 
Local Health Department STD clinics should provide partners with medications supplied to them by the 
Kentucky STD Prevention Program. STD clinics may not charge for partner medications supplied by the 
Kentucky STD Prevention Program. The clinic may provide a written prescription for the index patient to 
take to his or her partner(s) to fill at the clinic or DIS may also deliver medications to partners under 
certain circumstances. The prescription will be written in the partner(s)’s name. 
 
Selecting Appropriate Patients for EPT 
 
Appropriate patients are heterosexual and have a clinical or presumptive diagnosis of chlamydia or 
gonorrhea infection. 
 
The partners of the following patients are candidates for EPT: 
 
• 
Women with PID (treat partner for GC and CT) 
• 
Women with GC and/or CT diagnosed by lab testing 
• 
Men with laboratory diagnosis of chlamydia and/or gonorrhea or clinical diagnosis of NGU for 
female partners only 
• 
Women with mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC) (treat partner for CT) 
 
Exclusions from EPT 
 
• 
Partners with symptoms – especially fever, pelvic, testicular, groin, or abdominal pain. These 
partners need a clinical evaluation. 
• 
MSM because of the additional risk of syphilis or HIV infection. These partners need a clinical 
evaluation and HIV/syphilis testing. 
 
Partner Treatment: 
 
Gonorrhea: cefixime 800 mg 
 
Chlamydia: Non-pregnant partners - Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times a day for 7 days 
Pregnant partners - Azithromycin 1 gm 
 
Partners in the 60 days prior to diagnosis should be treated with the same medication(s). Partners of 
partners are not candidates for EPT. 
 
Partner Information 
 
Written partner informational materials are printed in the partner’s language and given to the patient to 
deliver to each partner. A referral for partner evaluation is included. Key partner counseling messages 
include: 
 
• 
Partners should seek a complete STD evaluation as soon as possible. 
• 
Partners should read the informational material very carefully before taking the medication. 
• 
Partners who have allergies to antibiotics or who have serious health problems should not take 
the medication and should see a health care provider. 
• 
Partners who have symptoms of a more serious infection (e.g., pelvic pain in women, testicular 
          330
STD 
JULY 2023 
 
 
Guidance for Delivering Expedited Partner Therapy 
pain in men, or fever in men or women) should not take EPT and should seek care as soon as 
possible. 
• 
Partners who are or who could be pregnant should seek care as soon as possible. 
• 
Patients and partners should abstain from sex for at least seven days after treatment and for 
seven days after all partners have been treated, to reduce the risk of recurrent infection. 
• 
Index patients should re-test three months after treatment. 
Documentation 
The names of partners receiving EPT are written in the index patient’s chart. Sexual partners do not 
require a medical chart to be provided EPT. 
Additional note in the index patient’s chart documents the following information: 
• 
The number of partners who are being provided with EPT 
• 
The medication and dose being provided 
• 
Whether the partner(s) are pregnant 
• 
Or known to be allergic to antibiotics. 
A log is kept documenting the following information: 
• 
Index patient’s name 
• 
Date of birth 
• 
Date medication(s) given 
• 
Name of medication and strength 
• 
Number of doses given

PROTOCOLS FOR TREATMENT OF COMMON SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES (continued) 
1 Some patients who are allergic to penicillin may also be allergic to ceftriaxone or other cephalosporin regimens. Doxycycline is the preferred 
syphilis treatment if allergic to PCN. There are limited clinical studies for ceftriaxone for the treatment of syphilis. If neither penicillin nor 
doxycycline can be administered for the treatment of syphilis desensitization may be necessary. Close follow-up of persons receiving any 
alternative therapies is essential. 2 Tetracycline/doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy; erythromycin is not recommended for the treatment 
of syphilis in pregnancy because it does not reliably cure an infected fetus; data insufficient to recommend azithromycin or ceftriaxone. 
3 In most situations Quinolones should not be used for the treatment of gonorrhea. If a quinolone is the only alternative regimen available for 
gonorrhea, a test of cure is required. A test of cure can be performed using the APTIMA CT/GC COMBO 2 (NAAT) TEST 3 weeks after 
completion of therapy. 4 Because erythromycin effectiveness in treating pneumonia caused by C. trachomatis is approximately 80%, a second 
course of therapy might be required. An association between oral erythromycin and azithromycin and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis 
(IHPS) has been reported among infants aged <6 weeks. Infants treated with either of these antimicrobials should be followed for IHPS signs 
and symptoms. 5 Clindamycin cream is oil-based and may weaken latex condoms and diaphragms for 5 days after use. 6 Clindamycin ovules 
use an oleaginous base that might weaken latex or rubber products (e.g., condoms and diaphragms). Use of such products within 72 hours 
after treatment with clindamycin ovules is not recommended. 7 Tinidazole should be avoided during pregnancy.

latent TB infection or 
active TB disease 
Complete patient TB Risk Assessment (TB-4) 
prior to tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood 
assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
(BAMT) for all classifications. TSTs are 
preferred for children aged less than 5 years. 
Tuberculin skin test (TST) with Purified 
Protein Derivative (PPD) using the Mantoux 
Method (use Tubersol antigen) 
The TST must be given and read by a 
licensed medical professional per 902 KAR 
20:205 
A two-step TST is usually recommended 
initially for anyone required to have regular 
TB testing, regardless of age. 
Two-Step TST: 
• 
If first step TST is positive, consider 
the person infected. 
• 
If first step TST is negative, give the 
second step TST 1-3 weeks later. 
• 
If second step TST is positive, 
consider the person infected. 
• 
If second step TST is negative, 
consider the person uninfected. 
See TST recommendations for infants, 
children, and adolescents 
See procedure for TST in this reference. 
Review CDC TST video, 2006. 
BAMTs are one-step in-vitro tests that assess 
for the presence of infection with M. 
tuberculosis. 
• 
BAMT reported as positive, consider 
the person infected. 
Educate on signs and 
symptoms of active TB 
disease, risk factors for 
Latent TB Infection 
(LTBI), and risk factors 
for rapid progression 
from LTBI to active TB 
disease. 
Some groups may need annual 
TB Risk Assessments (TB-4). 
Some groups (e.g., HCWs) may 
need annual TSTs or BAMTs in 
addition to annual TB Risk 
Assessments (TB-4). 
All testing activities should be 
accompanied by a plan for follow- 
up care. 
Patients should return in 48-72 
hours for TST readings, 
interpretation, and recording by a 
licensed medical professional. 
Anergy Suspects: 
Do not rule out TB diagnosis 
based on a negative skin test 
result. Consider anergy if the 
person is immunosuppressed. 
Also, see other 
diseases/conditions that can 
cause suppression of delayed- 
type hypersensitivity (DTH) 
response. 
Delayed-type hypersensitivity

1. 
Each LHD shall have a designated employee responsible for Tuberculosis (TB) services in their county. This person must attend periodic TB updates as outlined in 
the LHD Administrative Reference and keep updated by having the latest educational and scientific materials for the prevention and control of TB from CDC/ATS/ALA,

2. 
The physician or clinician knowledgeable in the field of mycobacterial diseases shall provide patient care. They shall agree to update themselves through professional 
meetings, consultations, and review of journal articles. This must be a component of any LHD contract for TB clinician services. 
This current classification system of tuberculosis (TB) is based on the pathogenesis of TB. A person with a classification of 3 or 5 should be receiving

Do the following: 
• 
Patient TB Risk Assessment (TB-4) 
• 
Medical History (TB H&P 13 or TB 
20 follow-up form) 
• 
TST or BAMT (unless there is 
previously documented positive 
reaction) 
• 
Chest x-ray, at the same time as 
those who: Have TB symptoms; are 
HIV infected or have other 
immunosuppressed conditions or 
are < 4 years of age. 
Posterior-Anterior (PA) chest x-ray is the 
standard view used to detect abnormalities. 
Infants and children <5 years of 
age, who are high priority 
contacts and who have a 
negative TST or negative BAMT, 
should be started on window 
period prophylaxis, with therapy 
administered by Directly 
Observed Preventive Therapy 
(DOPT) until retested in 8-10 
weeks. 
If repeat TST or BAMT is 
positive, continue medicines by 
DOPT (see classification 2). 
If repeat TST or BAMT is 
negative, stop medicines unless 
contact with infectious case has 
not or can not be broken. 
Contacts with 
immunocompromising conditions 
(i.e., HIV) that have a negative 
TST or negative BAMT should be 
started on window prophylaxis 
therapy by DOPT until retested in 
8-10 weeks. If the repeat TST or 
BAMT remains negative, and an 
evaluation for active TB disease 
is negative, a full course of 
treatment for LTBI should still be 
completed. 
See medications to treat LTBI in 
this reference. 
Discuss the following: 
• 
How TB is transmitted 
• 
LTBI vs active TB 
disease 
• 
Importance and 
significance of repeat 
skin test in 8-10 weeks 
• 
Treatment of active TB 
disease or LTBI 
• 
Importance of taking 
medicine on a regular 
basis, if indicated 
Steps for patient producing a 
sputum specimen at home: 
1) 
Clean & thoroughly rinse 
mouth with water 
2) 
Breathe deeply 3 times (a 
tickling sensation at the end 
of breath) 
3) 
After 3rd breath, cough hard 
& try to bring up sputum 
from deep in the lungs 
4) 
Expectorate sputum into a 
sterile container, collecting 
at least one teaspoonful 
5) 
Perform this in a properly 
ventilated room, booth, or 
outdoors. 
If TST or BAMT is negative, 
must return 8-10 weeks after 
contact has been broken for 
repeat TST or BAMT. 
To avoid difficulty with test 
interpretation in a contact 
investigation, the follow-up TB 
test method for a particular 
contact, whether TST or BAMT, 
should preferably be the same 
test method used for the first TB 
test. Use of the same test 
method for repeat testing will 
minimize the number of 
conversions that occur because 
of test differences. 
PA and Lateral view should be done on those 
< 5 years of age. 
If symptomatic, see sputum collection 
recommendations in this reference and in 
online forms. 
Provide patient information for an 
informed consent.

I. 
Initial Steps For Non-hospitalized Patients: Upon notification of a suspected or confirmed active 
case, the TB Nurse Case Manager (NCM) should initiate the following steps: 
 
1.) Assure or obtain medical standing orders for the following: 
a. Isolate patient to prevent transmission 
b. Collect 3 sputum (8-24 hours apart, with at least one early morning specimen) to assess 
infectiousness of patient 
c. 
Submit sputum to the KY Division of Laboratory Services (DLS) with orders to perform 
PCR/GeneXpert rapid testing to rule out drug resistance 
 
2.) Reporting 
• 
Notify the state TB Program via phone call or secure email with the following information: 
1. Patient’s name and DOB 
2. Any clinical evidence of suspected or known case 
3. Method of specimen shipment and estimated date of arrival to DLS 
• 
Request state TB Program approval for PCR/GeneXpert testing 
o 
The state TB Program will notify DLS of approval 
3.) Initiate patient interview 
• 
Call patient to introduce yourself and explain the LHD role. (If patient is not alert or difficulty 
with providing a history, then you will need their emergency contact info to interview.) 
•

II. 
Initial Steps For Hospitalized Patients: Upon notification of a suspected or confirmed 
hospitalized patient, The TB Nurse Case Manager (NCM) should immediately contact the facility 
Infection Control Preventionist (ICP). This individual should be your primary contact to assure 
continuity of care. 
During this call, the NCM should initiate the following: 
 
1.) Assure isolation 
• 
If patient is not in Airborne Infection Isolation (AII), then it alert the ICP that this must 
be initiated immediately. If patient is in isolation, then confirm date patient was placed 
in AII. 
 
2.) Assess infectiousness 
• 
Assure sputum collection has been initiated and inquire is patient has any signs or 
symptoms 
• 
Ask for results of sputum smear(s), PCR (GeneXpert), and/or culture(s) 
 
3.) Rule out drug resistance 
• 
Ask, if there is there is remaining sputum that can be sent to the state Division of 
Laboratory Services (DLS) 
4.) If PCR or GeneXpert not performed, the facility will need to collect more sputum to send to DLS 
for GeneXpert (Send first one immediately upon collection, then collect two more to send)Assess 
for initiation of standard conventional anti-TB medication regimen 
• 
Inquire about the name of the attending physician 
• 
Ask if meds have been started. If so, confirm date initiated and dosages. 
• 
If not, then recommend waiting to initiate until more sputum has been collected. 
(Medication can be started after collection of first sputum) 
 
5.) Reporting 
• 
Notify the state TB Program to relay all above information 
o 
Request approval for PCR/GeneXpert at DLS 
 
The state TB Program will notify DLS of PCR approval 
• 
Notify the contracted TB provider to relay all above information and provide name/contact info 
of attending physician to coordinate care and future discharge planning 
 
6.) Assure continuity of care and collaboration of partnership 
• 
Hospital must collaborate with the LHD to assure continuity of care and prevent community 
transmission of an infectious disease

TUBERCULOSIS CASE DEFINITIONS 
TB SUSPECT DEFINITION: A tuberculosis (TB) suspect is a person for whom there is a high index of 
suspicion for active TB who is currently under evaluation for TB disease. The TB suspect definition is not 
a part of the official TB Case definition. 
 
 
CASE DEFINITION: Tuberculosis (TB) (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) 
2009 Case Definition, CSTE Position Statement: 09-ID-65 
The official case definition for TB only contains confirmed case criteria. For surveillance purposes, in 
order to be classified as a confirmed case of TB, you must meet one of the following four (4) criteria: 
1. Positive Culture for M. tuberculosis 
• 
Isolation of M. tuberculosis from a clinical specimen culture result. 
o 
This will most commonly be a pulmonary-sources specimen (i.e. sputum, 
bronchial lavage/washing, lung tissue biopsy), but can be a specimen from 
anywhere in the body. 
2. Positive Nucleic Acid Amplification for M. tuberculosis Complex 
• 
Demonstration of M. tuberculosis Complex from a clinical specimen by nucleic acid 
amplification test. 
o 
A nucleic acid amplification test is also often referred to as a PCR test. 
o 
For M. tuberculosis Complex, this is most often conducted using a GeneXpert. 
3. Clinical Case Criteria for TB 
• 
If the patient does not meet bacteriologic criteria to meet the case definition (i.e. negative 
culture, and negative nucleic acid amplification result), they can been considered a 
confirmed clinical case if they meet all of the following criteria: 
o 
Positive TB skin test and/or Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) (i.e. 
Quantiferon or TSPOT) 
o 
Signs and symptoms compatible with active TB (i.e. abnormal chest radiograph, 
cough/hemoptysis, cheat pain, shortness of breath, night sweats, fatigue, etc.) 
o 
Treatment with at least two or more TB drugs (i.e. RIPE therapy) 
o 
A complete diagnostic evaluation. 
4. Verified by Provider Diagnosis 
• 
If the patient does not meet bacteriologic criteria or the clinical case criteria, they can still 
quality as a confirmed case of TB by provider diagnosis. 
• 
The state TB Epidemiologist will have to manually override the patient’s TB investigation 
in NEDSS to become “Verified by Provider Diagnosis” and officially counted as a 
confirmed case of TB. 
o 
This is essentially the same process that a clinical case would go through to be 
counted as confirmed case, but they just do not meet at least one of the 
aforementioned criteria.

Risk Factors for Developing Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) Disease 
 
The below information may assist with explaining to your patient how or why they are being assessed for 
active TB disease: 
 
Some people develop TB disease soon after becoming infected (within weeks) before their immune 
system can fight the TB bacteria. Other people may get sick years later when their immune system 
becomes weak for another reason. 
 
Overall, about 5 to 10% of infected persons who do not receive treatment for latent TB infection will 
develop TB disease at some time in their lives. For persons whose immune systems are weak, especially 
those with HIV infection, the risk of developing TB disease is much higher than for persons with normal 
immune systems. 
 
Generally, persons at high risk for developing TB disease fall into two categories: 
 
• 
Persons who have been recently infected with TB bacteria 
• 
Persons with medical conditions that weaken the immune system 
 
Persons who have been Recently Infected with TB Bacteria 
 
This includes: 
 
• 
Close contacts of a person with infectious TB disease 
• 
Persons who have immigrated from areas of the world with high rates of TB 
• 
Children less than 5 years of age who have a positive TB test 
• 
Groups with high rates of TB transmission, such as homeless persons, injection drug users, and 
persons with HIV infection 
• 
Persons who work or reside with people who are at high risk for TB in facilities or institutions such 
as hospitals, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, nursing homes, and residential homes for 
those with HIV 
 
Persons with Medical Conditions that Weaken the Immune System 
 
Babies and young children often have weak immune systems. Other people can have weak immune 
systems, too, especially people with any of these conditions: 
 
• 
HIV infection (the virus that causes AIDS) 
• 
Substance abuse 
• 
Silicosis 
• 
Diabetes mellitus 
• 
Severe kidney disease 
• 
Low body weight 
• 
Organ transplants 
• 
Head and neck cancer 
• 
Medical treatments such as corticosteroids or organ transplant 
• 
Specialized treatment for rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn’s disease

Recommendations for Sputum Collection 
 
Purpose 
Frequency 
Number of Specimens 
Baseline for TB suspects 
Initial 
3 samples that are collected 8 – 24 hours 
apart. Recommend at least one sample 
collection be observed by health care worker. 
Obtain sputum samples BEFORE initiating 
tuberculosis therapy. 
NAA testing should be performed on at least one respiratory specimen from each patient with signs and 
symptoms of pulmonary TB for whom a diagnosis of TB is being considered but has not yet been 
established, and for whom the test result would alter case management or TB control activities.* 
Monitoring for smear 
and culture conversion 
(AFB Smear positive 
Culture positive) 
Initially positive 
Every 2 weeks after 2 weeks 
of therapy have been 
completed, until 3 consecutive 
AFB smears are negative. 
1 sample – Recommend collection be observed by 
health care worker 
After 2 months of 
uninterrupted therapy. 
3 samples on consecutive days. 
Recommend collection be observed by 
health care worker 
Note: 3 negative smears are 
required per 902 KAR 20:200 
and 902 KAR 20:016 
If still positive, treatment regimen must be 
re-evaluated 
Monitoring during 
treatment for culture 
conversion 
(AFB Smear negative 
Culture positive) 
Every 2 weeks until 
2 consecutive specimens 
are negative on culture. 
3 samples on consecutive days. Recommend at 
least one be observed by health care worker 
• Patients who have positive cultures after 
4 months of treatment should be treated as 
treatment failures (MMWR, June 20, 2003) 
Monitoring after culture 
conversion to negative 
(or a clinical case) 
Monthly until treatment is 
completed. Patient may not 
be able to produce sputum 
at this point 
1 sample. Recommend collection be observed by 
health care worker 
Frequency of collections may be increased if there 
is a recurrence of symptoms or treatment 
interruption. Patients with MDR-TB or HIV infection 
and TB may require additional sputum testing to 
monitor their clinical course 
Send specimens to the state lab and instruct 
private hospitals and physicians to use the state 
lab 
Obtain three (3) consecutive sputum samples for any patient who has evidence of worsening clinical 
signs / symptoms of active TB disease (i.e. new cough, hemoptysis, fever, sweats, or worsening chest 
x-ray findings)**

GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay TESTING PROTOCOL 
TB 
JULY 2023 
 
 
 
Intended Use 
 
• 
The GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay is intended for use with sputum specimens from patients for 
whom there is clinical suspicion of tuberculosis (TB). This test is intended as an aid in 
the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis when used in conjunction with clinical and 
other laboratory findings. The GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay must also be used in conjunction 
with mycobacterial culture to address the risk of false negative results and to recover the 
organisms for further characterization and drug susceptibility testing. 
 
• 
Sample Criteria 
 
• 
Sputum samples (raw sputum or concentrated sediments prepared from induced or expectorated 
sputum) from a patient with first time positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum- smear results will be 
tested with the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay. Exceptions to this protocol include: 
 
• 
grossly bloody specimens, 
• 
non-sputum specimens (e.g., blood, CSF, gastric aspirate, stool, tissue, urine, etc.) except 
for specimens obtained by BAL, 
• 
patients that have been treated for M. tuberculosis complex within the last year,

Sample Storage 
 
• 
Sputum specimens may be stored for a maximum of 3 days at room temperature (maximum 
temperature not to exceed 35°C or 95°F) or up to 10 days at refrigerated (2-8°C) temperature 
from collection. 
• 
Sputum sediment may be stored up to 7 days from collection at refrigerator (2-8°C) 
temperature. 
 
• 
Testing 
 
• 
Testing will be performed within 24 hours from the time a positive AFB sputum-smear result is 
reported. Please contact the DLS TB lab at 502-564-4446 x 4422 or 4423 as soon as 
possible if a sample is anticipated to arrive to the DLS in the mid to late afternoon. This 
advance notification will help the TB staff in their planning on whether to perform the test 
beyond the standard operating hours of 8 AM until 4:30 PM (Eastern Time Zone) and to 
prepare necessary reagents/supplies for GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay testing.

GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay TESTING PROTOCOL 
TB 
JULY 2023 
 
 
 
• 
Specimens from patients with negative AFB sputum-smear results are not routinely tested by 
the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay. Medical providers should contact the State TB program for 
consultation concerning testing of patients with negative AFB sputum- smear results and with 
signs and symptoms of active TB disease. The State TB program will discuss criteria and 
provide guidance on a case-to-case basis with the submitter and will gladly provide 
consultation on any suspected TB case. Only smear negative specimens approved through 
the state TB Program will be tested. If approved, three early morning or induced sputum 
specimens may be sent to DLS. The sensitivity of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay for detection 
of M. tuberculosis from AFB-smear negative specimens is 76.1%. 
 
 
• 
State TB Program contacts: 502-564-4276 
 
 
• 
Limitations 
 
• 
GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay is not a test of cure and should not be performed on patients who 
have received more than 3 days of treatment. Previously treated patients must be off anti- 
tuberculosis therapy for at least 1 year for valid testing. 
• 
A negative test does not exclude the possibility of isolating MTB-complex from the sputum 
sample. The GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay must be used in conjunction with mycobacterial 
culture to address the risk of false negative results and to recover the organism for further 
characterization and susceptibility testing. 
• 
A positive test does not necessarily indicate the presence of viable organisms. 
• 
The GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay does not differentiate between the species of the MTB- 
complex (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. africanum, M. bovis, 
o 
M. bovis BCG, M. canettii, M. caprae, M. microti, or M. pinnipedii) 
• 
Because the detection of MTB-complex is dependent on the number of organisms 
present in the sample, accurate results are dependent on proper specimen collection, 
handling, and storage. Erroneous test results might occur from improper specimen 
collection 
• 
The performance of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay has not been evaluated with samples from 
pediatric patients. 
• 
The test is FDA approved only for sputum specimens (induced or non-induced). Testing on 
other respiratory specimens (e.g., BAL) will be reported with a disclaimer. No other 
specimens will be tested by this method.

INTERFERING SUBSTANCES 
 
Potential inhibitory effects of substances that may be present in samples processed with the 
GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay include, but are not limited to, blood, pus, mammalian cells, and 
hemoglobin. Interference may be observed in the presence of Lidocaine (>20% v/v), mucin (>1.5% 
E 
(>0.008% v/v). 
 
Note: Please call the TB Lab for any questions or guidance on entering any TB testing request 
orders in the DLS Psyche Outreach LIMS System. Please include thorough patient clinical history 
and administration of any current and past drug treatment for tuberculosis. When entering orders 
for patient specimens in Outreach it is important to search for previous orders on that 
particular patient. If the patient has previous orders, select that patient to bring up all the patient 
demographics on file and proceed with edit clinical order. This links the patient data that is crucial 
for patient history, surveillance, and tracking patient results. This information is helpful for the state 
TB program and for the DLS lab to better serve the patient and submitter in public health’s goals of 
expedited treatment, TB control, and in the national and global efforts to eliminate TB.

Managing Laboratory Data 
 
• 
The LHD shall ensure that all culture positive pulmonary and extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
isolates from outside laboratories are sent to the State Public Health Laboratory for drug susceptibility and 
genotype testing. Per the amendments to the Kentucky regulation, “902 KAR 2:020, Reportable disease 
surveillance,” http://www.lrc.ky.gov/kar/902/002/020.htm, “A medical or national reference laboratory shall 
submit clinical isolates or, if not available, the direct specimen from” tuberculosis cases to the Division of 
Laboratory Services (i.e., the State Public Health Laboratory). All direct specimens or clinical isolates from 
enteric disease shall be submitted within seventy-two (72) hours from collection. 
• 
The LHD shall ensure that copies of sputum positive TB culture results, positive TB culture results from any 
other body site, and positive results for Nucleic Acid Amplification tests (e.g., MTD positive results and PCR 
positive results) from outside laboratories are sent to the State TB Prevention and Control Program. Copies 
should be sent to the Kentucky TB Program within one (1) business day of being received by LHD TB 
Coordinators. 
 
• 
It is the responsibility of the LHD to ensure that drug susceptibility testing is performed on initial culture positive 
pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB isolates. Send a copy of the laboratory report about drug susceptibility 
testing to the State TB Prevention and Control Program. Outside laboratories that report culture positive 
pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB isolates may need an additional physician order to perform drug 
susceptibility testing. 
 
• 
It is recommended that all sputum samples be sent to the State Public Health Lab for testing.

GUIDELINES FOR PATIENT FOLLOW-UP NOTIFICATION 
 
For active TB cases, suspects, contacts to cases, and individuals receiving directly observed preventive therapy DOPT, 
LHDs shall make at least three attempts to notify patients / parents of missed appointments, abnormal laboratory or 
radiology tests as follows: 
 
1. 
Initial contact may be made by telephone if the number is available. 
 
2. 
The second contact should be a regular mailed letter with directions for the patient to contact the LHD 
for follow-up. 
 
3. 
The third contact should be a certified or registered letter with directions for the patientto contact the LHD for 
follow-up. The letter receipt shall be retained or scanned in the patient’s medical record. 
 
4. 
If the patient cannot be contacted by the above measures, a face-to-face visit shall be attempted. 
5. 
If after three of the above measures are made with no response, the LHD should document in the 
medical record that the patient is lost to follow-up care and notify the KY TB Program for additional 
guidance.

TUBERCULIN SKIN TEST (TST) RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INFANTS, 
CHILDREN, AND ADOLESCENTS1 
Children for whom immediate TST or IGRA is indicated2: 
• 
Contacts of people with confirmed or suspected contagious [active] tuberculosis 
[disease] (contact investigation) 
• 
Children with radiographic or clinical findings suggesting [active] tuberculosis disease 
• 
Children immigrating from countries with endemic infection (e.g., Asia, Middle East, Africa, 
Latin America, countries of the former Soviet Union) including international adoptees 
• 
Children with travel histories to countries with endemic infection and substantial contact 
with indigenous persons from such countries3 
Children who should have annual TST or IGRA: 
• 
Children infected with HIV infection (TST only) 
• 
Incarcerated adolescents 
 
Children at increased risk of progression of LTBI to tuberculosis disease: Children with other medical 
conditions, including diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, malnutrition, and congenital or acquired 
immunodeficiency’s deserve special consideration. Without recent exposure, these people are not at 
increased risk of acquiring tuberculosis infection. Underlying immune deficiencies associated with 
these conditions theoretically would enhance the possibility for progression to severe disease. Initial 
histories of potential exposure to tuberculosis should be included for all of these patients. If these 
histories or local epidemiologic factors suggest a possibility of exposure, immediate and periodic 
TST or IGRA should be considered. An initial TST or IGRA should be performed before initiation 
of immunosuppressive therapy, including prolonged steroid administration, use of tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha antagonists, or other immunosuppressive therapy in any child 
requiring these treatments.” 
 
A TST can be administered to individuals of any age who are at increased risk for acquiring LTBI or 
active TB disease, even to newborn infants (See Congenital Tuberculosis in the 2018 edition of the 
Red Book, p. 830.). 
 
 
 
 
IGRA indicates interferon-gamma release assay; HIV indicates human immunodeficiency virus; LTBI, latent tuberculosis 
infection. 
 
1 Bacille Calmette-Guérin immunization is not a contraindication to a TST. 
2 Beginning as early as 3 months of age. 
3 If the child is well, the TST or IGRA should be delayed for up to 10 weeks after return.

DEFINITIONS OF MYCOBACTERIUM COMPLEX: 
 
Mycobacterium can cause a variety of diseases. 
 
• Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the organism that causes TB in humans. 
• Mycobacterium africanum is closely related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 
but is very rare in the United States. 
• Mycobacterium avium complex is a common type of non-tuberculosis 
mycobacterium that can cause disease in humans. 
• Mycobacterium bovis can cause disease similar to TB and usually occurs in 
cows. Before pasteurization of milk was common, these mycobacteria were 
often spread to humans through contaminated milk. It rarely affects humans 
in the United States today. 
• Mycobacterium canetti can cause disease in humans. 
• Mycobacterium microti can cause generalized tuberculosis. 
 
CONVENTIONAL FOUR-DRUG ANTI-TUBERCULOSIS THERAPY: R.I.P.E. 
 
Rifampin (RIF): a drug used to treat TB disease and latent tuberculosis infection; 
possible side effects include hepatitis, turning body fluids orange. 
 
Isoniazid (INH): a drug used to treat TB disease and latent tuberculosis infection; 
relatively safe but may cause hepatitis and other adverse reactions in some patients. 
 
Pyrazinamide (PZA): a drug used to treat TB disease; used along with other listed 
drugs to treat TB; may cause hepatitis and other adverse reactions in some patients. 
 
Ethambutol (EMB): a drug used to treat TB disease; may cause vision problems; 
use with caution in children too young to be monitored for vision changes.

Treatment Algorithm for Culture-Positive Tuberculosis 
 
Patients in whom tuberculosis is proved or strongly suspected should have treatment initiated with isoniazid, rifampin, 
pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the initial 2 months. A repeat smear and culture should be performed when 2 months of 
treatment has been completed. If cavities were seen on the initial chest radiograph or the acid-fast smear is positive at 
completion of 2 months of treatment, the continuation phase of treatment should consist of isoniazid and rifampin daily or 
twice weekly for 4 months to complete a total of 6 months of treatment. If cavitation was present on the initial chest radiograph 
and the culture as the time of completion of 2 months of therapy is positive, the continuation phase should be lengthened to 7 
months (total of 9 months of treatment). If the patient has HIV infection and CD4* cell count is <100/μl, the continuation phase 
should consist of daily or three times weekly isoniazid and rifampin. In HIV-uninfected patients having no cavitation on chest 
radiograph and negative acid-fast smears at completion of 2 months of treatment, the continuation phase may consist of either 
once weekly isoniazid and rifapentine or daily or twice weekly isoniazid and rifampin, to complete a total of 6 months (bottom). 
Patients receiving isoniazid and rifapentine, and whose 2-month cultures are positive, should have treatment extended by an 
additional 3 months (total of 9 months). 
*EMB may be discontinued when results of drug susceptibility testing indicate no drug resistance. 
 
†PZA may be discontinued after it has been taken for 2 months (56 doses). 
 
‡RPT should not be used in HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis or in patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis.

Time (months) 
 
The decision to begin treatment for a patient with sputum smears that are negative depends on the degree of suspicion 
that the patient has tuberculosis. The considerations in choosing among the treatment options are discussed in text. If 
the clinical suspicion is high (bottom), then multidrug therapy should be initiated before acid-fast smear and culture results 
are known. If the diagnosis is confirmed by positive culture, treatment can be continued to complete a standard course of 
therapy (see Figure 1). If initial cultures remain negative and treatment has consisted of multiple drugs for 2 months, then 
there are two options depending on repeat evaluation at 2 months (bottom): 1) if the patient demonstrates symptomatic 
or radiographic improvement without another apparent diagnosis, then a diagnosis of culture-negative tuberculosis can be 
inferred. Treatment should be continued with isoniazid and rifampin alone for an additional 2 months; 2) if the patient 
demonstrates neither symptomatic nor radiographic improvement, then prior tuberculosis is unlikely; and treatment is 
complete once treatment including at least 2 months of rifampin and pyrazinamide has been administered. In low- 
suspicion patients not initially receiving treatment (top), if cultures remain negative, the patient has no symptoms, and the 
chest radiograph is unchanged at 2-3 months, there are three treatment options: these are 1) isoniazid for 9 months, 2) 
rifampin with or without isoniazid for 4 months, or 3) rifampin and pyrazinamide for 2 months. CXR = chest x-ray; EMB = 
ethambutol; INH = isoniazid; PZA = pyrazinamide; RIF = rifampin; Sx = signs/symptoms. (It should be noted that the 
RIF/PZA 2-month regimen should be used only for patients who are not likely to complete a longer course of treatment 
and can be monitored closely.)

DIRECTLY OBSERVED THERAPY (DOT) 
 
DOT is a method of ensuring patients’ adherence to therapy. LHD staff must recognize DOT as the 
Kentucky standard of care. All active TB disease, whether pulmonary or extrapulmonary, shall be treated 
by DOT. The DOT method must be conveyed with confidence to patients. Always respect the patient’s 
confidentiality. 
 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 
recommends that all TB patients be considered for DOT because of the difficulty in predicting who will 
adhere to the treatment regimen. 
 
The following persons must be placed on DOT for treatment of tuberculosis: 
 
• 
All patients being treated for suspected pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB. 
• 
All patients diagnosed with culture positive pulmonary and or extrapulmonary TB. 
• 
All patients diagnosed as a “clinical case” of pulmonary TB or extrapulmonary TB because of 
negative TB cultures but who had chest x-rayand / or clinical improvement on anti-TB therapy. 
 
DOT means that a specially trained health department health care professional, not related to the 
patient, watches the patient swallow each dose of TB medication. DOT is never to be delegated to a 
family member. Kentucky’s TB Control Program does not consider nor count the dosage as DOT if a 
family observes the patient taking the medication. Such actions could result in prolonged treatment and 
be considered noncompliance with the DOT agreement. 
 
Be aware of techniques a patient may use to avoid swallowing the medication such as hiding the pills in 
the mouth, spitting the pills into the fluid used to take them with, or vomiting the pills after leaving the 
treatment site. 
 
DOT reduces the frequency of treatment failures, of acquiring drug resistance, and in suffering relapse of 
the disease. Intermittent DOT reduces the total number of doses a patient must take and the number of 
encounters with LHD personnel. If the patient cannot go to a LHD, LHD staff can arrange another site 
that is safe, convenient, and agreeable to both patient and staff. Furthermore, staff providing additional 
daily healthcare services, such as dialysis or home health, can assist the LHD personnel with DOT 
therapy. 
 
Besides being cost effective, DOT has many other benefits. DOT is a patient-focused service that also 
provides the health care worker with a better understanding of the patient’s needs, thus placing the 
worker in position to assist with needed health or social services and making the appropriate referrals. 
DOT provides an effective opportunity for education, not only of the patient but also of the patient’s 
support system. DOT is also advantageous to the community because a patient on DOT becomes 
noninfectious much more quickly. This reduces the time that a patient is able to spread the disease in the 
community.

KY V-DOT 
Video Directly Observed Therapy 
Directly observed therapy (DOT) for tuberculosis increases patient adherence. This increased adherence 
both reduces the risk of disease recurrence and prevents the development of resistant Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis strains. 
 
Once the patient has completed eight (8) weeks of medication by DOT (initial phase), video DOT is an 
option. Video DOT is an option in place of at home/office DOT that local health departments can offer to 
patients. 
 
During Video DOT, the local health department determines a supply of pre-packaged medication doses that 
will be given to the patient at each clinic visit. The local health department personnel will arrange a set time 
for the remote video call with the patient. During the video call, the patient will be expected to display the 
medications onscreen*. The health worker will then witness the patient swallowing the medication. 
 
All patients participating must agree to the requirements of the Video DOT program and sign a consent 
form. 
 
All patients participating in Video DOT must have a face-to-face clinic visit at least one time per month 
during their treatment period. 
 
*See TB Program teaching sheet TB-14a for Video DOT protocols and consent form TB-14b. 
 
 
Exclusion Criteria for Video DOT 
 
 
• 
Patient in isolation to rule out infectiousness 
• 
Patient with side effects requiring graduated doses. 
• 
Illegal activities occurring in the home. 
• 
Video DOT must be accomplished within 15 minutes. 
• 
Lack of stable environment or lack of telephone at patient location. 
•

• 
Patient has received one (1) or more Health Orders due to noncompliance. 
• 
Less than 90% compliance with the treatment regimen or scheduled Video DOT

body weight [IBW], dosing based on IBW may be preferred for initial doses. Some clinicians prefer a modified IBW 
(IBW + [0.40x [actual weight – IBW]) as is done for initial aminoglycoside doses. Because tuberculosis drug dosing 
for obese patients has not been established, therapeutic drug monitoring may be considered for such patients. 
For purposes of this document, adult dosing begins at age 15 years or at a weight of >40kg in younger children. The 
optimal doses for thrice-weekly therapy in children and adolescents have not been established. Some experts use in 
adolescents the same doses as recommended for adults, and for younger children the same doses as recommended 
for twice-weekly therapy. 
Higher doses of rifampin, currently as high as 35mg/kg, are being studied in clinical trials. 
Rifabuten dose may need to be adjusted when there is concomitant use of protease inhibitors or nonnucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors. 
TBTC Study 22 used rifapentine (RPT) dosage of 10mg/kg in the continuation phase of treatment for active disease 
[9]. However, RIFAQUIN and PREVENT TB safely used higher dosages of RPT, administered once weekly [164, 
210]. Daily doses of 1200mg RPT are being studied in clinical trials for active tuberculosis disease. 
As an approach to avoiding ethambutol (EMB) ocular toxicity, some clinicians use a 3-drug regimen (INH, rifampin, 
and pyrazinamide) in the initial 2 months of treatment for children who are HIV-uninfected, have no prior tuberculosis 
treatment history, are living in an area of low prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis, and have no exposure to an 
individual from an area of high prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis. However, because the prevalence of and 
risk for drug-resistant tuberculosis can be difficult to ascertain, the American Academy of Pediatrics and most experts 
include EMB as part of the intensive-phase regimen for children with tuberculosis. 
Clinicians experienced with using cycloserine suggest starting with 250mg once daily and gradually increasing as 
tolerated. Serum concentrations often are useful in determining the appropriate dose for a given patient. Few 
patients tolerate 500mg twice daily. 
ₕEthionamide can be given at bedtime or with a main meal in an attempt to reduce nausea. Clinicians experienced 
with using ethionamide suggest starting with 250mg once daily and gradually increasing as tolerated. Serum 
concentrations may be useful in determining the appropriate dose for a given patient. Few patients tolerate 500mg 
twice daily. 
ⁱModified from adult intermittent dose of 25mg/kg, and accounting for larger total body water content and faster 
clearance of injectable drugs in most children. Dosing can be guided by serum concentrations. 
RIFAQUIN trial studied a 6-month regimen. Daily isoniazid was replaced by daily moxifloxacin 400mg for the first 2 
months, followed by once-weekly doses of moxifloxacin 400mg and RPT 1200mg for the remaining 4 months. Two 
hundred twelve patients were studied {each dose RPT was preceded by a meal of 2 hard-boiled eggs and bread.} 
This regimen was shown to be noninferior to a standard daily administered 6-month regimen [164].

PYRIDOXINE (VITAMIN B6) SUPPLEMENTATION DURING 
TREATMENT OF LTBI OR ACTIVE TB 
Prevention of Peripheral Neuropathy and Central Nervous Symptom Effects of INH 
Indications for pyridoxine when INH is ordered to treat LTBI or active TB disease: 
Adults: Pyridoxine supplementation can be ordered for any adult being treated with INH, unless 
there is a medical contraindication. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation is particularly 
recommended when INH is used for treatment of LTBI or active TB disease in some adults with 
medical conditions where peripheral neuropathy is common, such as1, 2, 3: 
 
• 
Nutritional deficiencies 
• 
Diabetes 
• 
HIV infection 
• 
Chronic renal failure 
• 
Alcoholism 
• 
Persons with seizure disorders 
• 
Pregnant women 
• 
Breastfeeding women 
 
Infants, children, and adolescents1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: Routine administration of pyridoxine is not 
recommended for most children and adolescents taking INH4. Pyridoxine is recommended when 
INH is used for treatment of LTBI or active 
TB disease in some infants, children, and adolescents at increased risk for 
peripheral neuritis or other INH adverse effects, such as: 
 
• 
Breastfed infants, particularly those who are exclusivelybreastfed 
• 
Children and adolescents on meat- and milk-deficient diets 
• 
Children and adolescents with nutritional deficiencies 
• 
Children who experience paresthesia while taking isoniazid 
• 
HIV infection, particularly symptomatic HIV-infected individuals 
• 
Pregnant adolescents 
• 
Breastfeeding adolescents 
Dose of pyridoxine when INH is ordered to treat LTBI or active TB disease: 
Adults: 
CDC guidelines – 25 mg/day1 
Wisconsin TB Program guidelines – 10 to 50 mg/day2 
The Harriet Lane Handbook5 – 25 to 100 mg/day 
 
Infants, children, and adolescents: 
 
The Harriet Lane Handbook5: Child – 1-2 mg/kg/day. Pyridoxine injectable can be compounded with simple 
syrup to make an oral solution containing 1 mg/mL6. 
10 mg/day to 25 mg/day1

Prevention of Neurotoxic Effects of Cycloserine (A Second-line TB drug) in Adults: 
Pyridoxine may help prevent and treat neurotoxic side effects of cycloserine in the treatment 
of active TB disease and is usually given in a dosage of 100--200 mg/day.1 
 
Recommended Daily Allowances and Recommended Maximum Daily Intake7: 
“The daily recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) of vitamin B6 are: 
• 
Infants 0-6 months, 0.1 mg; 
• 
Infants 7-12 months, 0.3 mg; 
• 
Children 1-3 years, 0.5 mg; 
• 
Children 4-8 years, 0.6 mg; 
• 
Children 9-13 years, 1 mg; 
• 
Males 14-50 years, 1.3 mg; 
• 
Males over 50 years, 1.7 mg; 
• 
Females 14-18 years, 1.2 mg; 
• 
Females 19-50 years, 1.3 mg; 
• 
Females over 50 years, 1.5 mg; 
• 
Pregnant women, 1.9 mg; 
• 
Breastfeeding women, 2 mg. 
 
Some researchers think the RDA for women 19-50 years should be increased to 1.5-1.7 mg 
per day. The recommended maximum daily intake is: 
• 
Children 1-3 years, 30 mg; 
• 
Children 4- 8 years, 40 mg; 
• 
Children 9-13 years, 60 mg; 
• 
Adults, pregnant and breast-feeding women, 14-18 years, 80 mg; 
• 
Adults, pregnant and breast-feeding women, over 18 years, 100 mg.”

Extra-Pulmonary Tuberculosis 
 
Extra-pulmonary TB disease may cause symptoms related to the part of the body that is affected. For 
example, TB of the spine may cause back pain; TB of the kidney may cause blood in the urine; TB 
meningitis may cause headache or confusion. Extra-pulmonary TB disease should be considered in the 
differential diagnosis of ill persons who have systemic symptoms and who are at high risk for TB disease. 
Both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB disease symptoms can be caused by other diseases; however, 
they should prompt the clinician to consider TB disease.

*For diagnostic purposes, all persons suspected of having TB disease at any site should have 
sputum specimens collected for an AFB smear and culture, even those without respiratory 
symptoms. 
 
As a general rule, regimens for treating persons with pulmonary tuberculosis are also effective for treating 
extrapulmonary tuberculosis disease. With the exception of the meninges or central nervous system, 6 
MONTHS of treatment is recommended for treating extrapulmonary tuberculosis. 
 
A 9-to 12-month regimen is recommended for meninges or central nervous system tuberculosis; and a 6- 
to 9-month regimen is recommended for bone and joint tuberculosis. 
 
As always, please consider extending treatment for any tuberculosis site of infection that is slow to 
respond to treatment.

CRITERIA TO DETERMINE NON-INFECTIOUSNESS 
 
Criteria for determining when, during therapy, a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) has become 
noninfectious* 
 
 
• 
Patient has negligible likelihood of multidrug-resistant TB (no known exposure to multidrug- 
resistant tuberculosis and no history of prior episodes of TB with poor compliance during 
treatment.) 
• 
Patient has received standard multidrug anti-TB therapy for 2-3 weeks. (For patients with sputum 
acid-fast bacilli [AFB] smear results that are negative or rarely positive, threshold for treatment is 
5-7 days.) 
• 
Patient has demonstrated complete adherence to treatment (e.g., is receiving directly observed 
therapy.) 
• 
Patient has demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement (e.g., reduction in the frequency of 
cough or reduction of the grade of the sputum AFB smear result.) 
• 
All close contacts of patient have been identified, evaluated, advised, and if indicated, started on 
treatment for latent TB infection. This criterion is critical, especially for children aged < 4 years 
and persons of any age with immunocompromising health conditions (e.g., HIV infection.) 
• 
While in hospital for any reason, patient with pulmonary TB should remain in airborne infection 
isolation (AII) until they: 1) are receiving standard multidrug anti-TB therapy; 2) have 
demonstrated clinical improvement; and 3) have had three consecutive AFB-negative smear 
results of sputum specimens collected 8-24 hours apart, with at least one being an early morning 
specimen. Hospitalized patients returning to a congregate setting (e.g., a homeless shelter or 
detention facility) should have three consecutive AFB-negative smear results of sputum 
specimens collected > 8 hours apart before being considered noninfectious. 
 
Source: http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/PDF/rr/rr5412.pdf (Box 3, pg 9) 
 
*These criteria for absence of infectivity with treatment should be considered general guidelines. 
Decisions about infectivity of a person on treatment for TB should depend on the extent of illness and the 
specific nature and circumstances of the contact between the patient and exposed persons.

MANAGEMENT OF 
TB INFECTION (LTBI) 
 
LATENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION 
REPORTABLE CASES 
 
In order to assist in the management of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), the following individuals with 
LTBI are required to be reported to the Kentucky Tuberculosis Program: 
• 
Persons who are contacts of persons with active TB disease 
• 
Health care workers 
• 
Residents of long-term care facilities (LTCF) 
• 
Refugees, refugee status 
 
 
RISK FACTORS FOR Mycobacterium tuberculosis INFECTION 
 
Persons at increased risk* for M.tuberculosis infection: 
 
 
• 
Close contacts of persons known or suspected to have active tuberculosis 
• 
Foreign-born persons from areas that have a high incidence of active tuberculosis 
(e.g., Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Russia) 
• 
Persons who visit areas with a high prevalence of active tuberculosis, especially if visits are 
frequent or prolonged. 
• 
Residents and employees of congregate settings whose clients are at increased risk for active 
tuberculosis (e.g., correctional facilities, long-term care facilities, and homeless shelters) 
• 
Healthcare workers who serve clients who are increased risk for active tuberculosis disease 
• 
Populations defined locally as having an increased incidence of latent M. tuberculosis infection or 
active tuberculosis, possibly including medically underserved, low-income populations, or person 
who abuse drugs or alcohol 
• 
Infants, children, and adolescents exposed to adults who are at increased risk for latent M. 
tuberculosis infection or active tuberculosis.

DIRECTLY OBSERVED PREVENTIVE THERAPY (DOPT) 
FOR LATENT TB INFECTION 
 
A major step in controlling TB in a community is to make sure that a patient who is being treated 
for latent TB infection (LTBI) completes a course of treatment. DOPT is the only way to ensure 
that these patients are adherent (connected to or associated with) to the medication. As 
Kentucky is experiencing a decline in the number of TB cases, it is time to put a stronger focus 
on treating latent TB infection. 
 
The Kentucky TB Control Program is advocating that the LHDs provide DOPT to higher risk 
patients, as well as to children. Children can be the most difficult clients when it comes to taking 
their medication. By providing DOPT, the health department not only prevents future cases of 
TB, but also provides a valuable service to families. 
 
Members of the groups below are considered high-risk individuals when it comes to being 
adherent (connected to or associated with) to taking their medications. If found to have latent TB 
infection, members of these groups must be placed on DOPT: 
• 
Children and adolescents 
• 
Contacts to a case with active TB disease 
• 
Homeless individuals 
• 
Persons who abuse substances 
• 
Persons with a history of treatment non-adherence 
• 
Immunocompromised patients, especially HIV-infected

SECTION IV 
 
 
CONTACT INVESTIGATIONS 
 
 
 
 
The Goals of a Contact Investigation: 
 
• 
Rapid identification of individuals who are high priority contacts to a known or suspected case 
of pulmonary, laryngeal, or pleural TB; 
• 
Timely initiation of appropriate treatment for those persons determined to be recently infected 
or exposed with a significant risk for progression to disease; 
• 
Identification and treatment of additional individuals found to have suspected TB disease in 
order to prevent further spread of disease. 
 
Consult the State TB Program if you are planning a contact investigation for more than 10 people 
school, college, or large company). 
 
For complete guidelines on structuring a contact investigation see the “Guidelines for the Investigation 
of Contacts of Persons with Infectious Tuberculosis,” MMWR 2005:54 (No. RR-14).

JULY 2023 
 
 
PLANNING A CONTACT INVESTIGATION 
 
 
Initiating a Contact Investigation 
The contact investigation process should be started for persons suspected of having infectious TB 
disease, even before confirmation (See “Initial Assessment of Contacts” in this section). Contact 
Investigations of persons with acid-fast bacilli (AFB)-positive sputum smears, and cavitary TB are 
assigned the highest priority. However, even if these conditions are not present, contact investigations 
should be considered if a chest radiograph is consistent with pulmonary TB. A positive result from an 
approved nucleic acid amplification (NAA) test supports a decision to initiate an investigation. 
Because waiting for a sputum or respiratory culture result will delay the initiation of contact 
investigations, any delays should be avoided if any contacts are especially vulnerable or 
susceptible to TB disease. If it is later determined that the suspect case does not have infectious TB 
disease, the contact investigation should be stopped. 
 
Confirmed TB Cases: 
A contact investigation is required for all confirmed cases that have infectious forms of TB disease 
(e.g., TB disease of the lungs, airways, or larynx). 
 
Suspected TB Cases: 
For suspect cases with AFB-negative sputum smears or sputum smears not performed, the contact 
investigation process should be started if the case has abnormal chest x-ray findings consistent with 
TB disease. 
 
For suspect cases with AFB-negative sputum smear results and no pulmonary cavities, a contact 
investigation should only be considered for certain circumstances, such as if the suspect was identified 
during an outbreak or source case investigation that included vulnerable or susceptible contacts. 
 
Extrapulmonary TB Disease: 
Persons with extrapulmonary TB disease are usually noninfectious unless they also have pulmonary TB 
disease; TB disease located in the oral cavity or the larynx; or extrapulmonary disease that includes an 
open abscess or lesion in which the concentration of organisms is high. Pulmonary TB should always 
be ruled out when there is a diagnosis of extrapulmonary disease.

Determining the Infectious Period for a Patient with Active TB Disease 
 
 
Determining the infectious period for a case with active TB disease focuses the investigation on those 
contacts most likely to be at risk for infection and sets the timeframe for testing contacts. Because the 
start of the infectious period cannot be determined with precision by available methods, a practical 
estimation is necessary. Per CDC guidelines, an assigned start date, that is 3 months before 
symptom onset or first positive finding consistent with active TB disease, is recommended (Table, p. 
50). In certain circumstances, an even earlier start date should be used. 
 
For example, a patient (or the patient's associates) might have been aware of protracted illness (in 
extreme cases, >1 year). Information from the patient interview and from other sources should be 
assembled to assist in estimating the infectious period. Helpful details are the approximate dates that 
TB symptoms were noticed, mycobacteriologic results, and extent of disease (especially the presence 
of large lung cavities, which imply prolongedillness). 
 
The infectious period is closed when the following criteria are satisfied: 
1) Effective treatment (as demonstrated by M. tuberculosis susceptibility results) for >2 weeks; 
2) Diminished symptoms; 
3) Mycobacteriologic response (e.g., decrease in grade of sputum smear positivity detected on sputum- 
smear microscopy). 
 
The exposure period for individual contacts is determined by how much time they spent with the index 
patient during the infectious period. Multidrug- resistant TB (MDR TB) can extend infectiousness if the 
treatment regimen is ineffective. Any index patient with signs of extended infectiousness should be 
continually reassessed for recent contacts. 
 
Criteria that are more stringent should be applied for setting the end of the infectious period if 
particularly susceptible contacts are involved. A patient returning to a congregate living setting or to 
any setting in which susceptible persons might be exposed should have at least three consecutive 
negative sputum AFB smear results from sputum collected >8 hours apart (with one specimen 
collected during the early morning) before being considered noninfectious.

Initial Assessment of Contacts 
 
 
During the initial contact encounter, which should be accomplished within 3 working days of the 
contact having been listed in the investigation, the investigator gathers background health information 
and makes a face-to-face assessment of the person's health. Performing a TB Risk Assessment and 
administering a TST or drawing blood for a BAMT during this time accelerates the diagnostic 
evaluation. 
 
The health department record should include: 
 
• 
Previous M. tuberculosis infection or active TB disease and related treatment; 
• 
Contact's verbal report and documentation of previous TST or BAMT results; 
• 
Current symptoms of active TB disease (e.g., cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, fever, chills, night 
sweats, appetite loss, weight loss, malaise, or easy fatigability); 
• 
Medical conditions or risk factors making active TB disease more likely 
o 
HIV infection 
o 
Infants and children aged less than five years; 
o 
Persons who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy such as tumor necrosis 
factor--alpha (TNF- 
antagonists, systemic corticosteroids equivalent to 
mg of 
prednisone per day, or immune suppressive drug therapy following organ 
transplantation; 
o 
Persons recently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (within the past two 
(2) years; 
o 
Persons with a history of inadequately treated active TBdisease; 
o 
Persons with silicosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, leukemia, 
lymphoma, cancer of the head, neck, or lung; 
o 
Persons who have had a gastrectomy, or jejunoileal bypass; 
o 
Persons with low body weight (BMI < 19); 
o 
Cigarette smokers and persons who abuse drugs or alcohol. 
• 
Mental health disorders (e.g., psychiatric illnesses and substance abuse disorders) 
• 
Type, duration, and intensity of TB exposure; and 
• 
Sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, race or ethnicity, residence, and country of birth) (see 
Data Management and Evaluation of Contact Investigations).

Window-Period Prophylaxis 
 
Primary prophylaxis of high-risk contacts: 
 
Tuberculin skin test results might take 2-10 weeks to become positive after infection with M. tuberculosis. 
Thus, a contact's initial TST or BAMT result might be negative even if the person is infected. A second TST or BAMT 
should be performed 8-10 weeks after the contact's last exposure to the infectious patient, so the possibility of LTBI for 
those persons can be better evaluated. During the 8-10 week window period between a first and second skin test or 
BAMT, the following contacts with initially negative tuberculin skin test results or negative BAMT results should receive 
treatment for LTBI after active TB disease has been ruled out by clinical examination and chest radiograph: 
 
• 
Contacts aged <5 years (with highest priority given to those aged <3 years) and 
• 
Contacts with HIV infection or who are otherwise immunocompromised. 
If the second TST result is negative (i.e. <5 mm) or the second BAMT is negative, the contact is immunocompetent 
(including immunocompetent young children) and no longer exposed to an infectious TB case, treatment for LTBI 
during the window period may be discontinued, and further follow-up is unnecessary. 
 
If the second TST or BAMT result is negative but the contact is immunocompromised (e.g., with HIV infection), and an 
evaluation for active TB disease is negative, a full course of treatment for LTBI still should be completed. 
 
If the second TST or BAMT result is negative but the person remains in close contact with an infectious TB case, 
treatment for LTBI should be continued if the contact is: 
 
• 
Aged <5 years; 
• 
Aged 5 through 15 years, at the clinician's discretion; or 
• 
HIV-infected or otherwise immunocompromised. 
The decision to treat individual contacts that have negative skin tests or negative BAMTs should take into 
consideration two factors: 
 
• 
The frequency, duration, and intensity of exposure (even brief exposure to a highly infectious TB patient 
in a confined space probably warrants the same concern as extended exposure to less infectious TB 
cases); and 
• 
Corroborative evidence of transmission from the index patient (e.g. a substantial fraction of contacts having 
TST or BAMT results classified as “positive” implies infectiousness).

GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USING BLOOD ASSAYS FOR 
 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (BAMTs) 
 
 
 
Before 2001, the tuberculin skin test (TST) was the only practical and commercially available immunologic test for 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection approved in the United States. Blood assay for M. tuberculosis (BAMT) is a 
general term to refer to recently developed in vitro diagnostic tests that assess for the presence of infection with M. 
tuberculosis. This term includes, but is not limited to, interferon-gamma (IFN- 
 
Since 2001, several IGRAs have been approved by FDA. In the United States, the currently available tests are the 
QuantiFERON®-TB Plus test (QFT-Plus) and the T-SPOT.TB test 
T). The following recommendations are from updated guidelines for using IGRAs in the June 25, 2010 MMWR: 
(Note that CDC guidelines describe the use of IGRAs instead of the more inclusive BAMT.) 
 
 
KEY POINTS FOR USING BAMTs 
 
• 
A BAMT may be used in place of (but not in addition to) a TST in all situations in which CDC 
recommends tuberculin skin testing as an aid in diagnosing M. tuberculosis infection 
• 
A BAMT is preferred for testing persons from groups that historically have low rates of returning to have 
TSTs read. For example, use of a BAMT might increase test completion rates for homeless persons and 
drug-users. 
• 
A BAMT is preferred for testing persons who have received BCG (as a vaccine or for cancer therapy). 
• 
A TST is preferred for testing children aged less than 5 years. 
• 
Two-step testing is not required for BAMTS, because IGRA testing does not boost subsequent test results. 
• 
Neither a BAMT nor TST can distinguish LTBI from active tuberculosis. 
• 
As with TSTs, a negative BAMT result does not exclude LTBI or active TB disease

Recommendations for Use of IGRAs 
 
General Recommendations for Use of IGRAs 
• 
TSTs and IGRAs (QFT-Plus, and T-SPOT) should be used as aids in diagnosing infection with 
M. tuberculosis. These tests may be used for surveillance purposes or to identify persons 
likely tobenefit from treatment, including persons who are or will be at increased risk for M. 
tuberculosis infection (Box 1, below) or for progression to active tuberculosis if infected (Box 2, 
below). 
• 
IGRAs should be performed and interpreted according to established protocols using FDA- 
approved test formats. They should be performed in compliance with Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendment (CLIA) standards. 
• 
Both the standard qualitative test interpretation and the quantitative assay measurements 
should be reported together with the criteria used for test interpretation. This will permit 
more refined assessment of results and promote understanding of the tests. 
• 
Arrangement for IGRA testing should be made prior to blood collection to ensure that 
the blood specimen is collected in the proper tubes, and that testing can be performed 
within the required timeframe. 
• 
Prior to implementing IGRAs, each institution and tuberculosis-control program should 
evaluate the availability, overall cost, and benefits of IGRAs for their own setting. In addition, 
programs should consider the characteristics of the population to be tested. 
• 
As with the TST, IGRAs generally should not be used for testing persons who have a low risk 
for both infection and progression to active tuberculosis if infected (except for those likely to be 
at increased risk in the future). Screening such persons diverts resources from higher priority 
activities and increases the number of false-positive results. Even with a test specificity 
approaching 99%, when the prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection 
positive results will be false positives. If persons at low risk for both infection and progression 
are to be tested, selection of the test with the greatest specificity will minimize false-positive 
results, reduce unnecessary evaluation and treatment, and minimize the potential for adverse 
events from unnecessary treatment. 
 
Test Selection 
• 
Selection of the most suitable test or combination of tests for detection of M. tuberculosis 
infection should be made on the basis of the reasons and the context for testing, test 
availability, and overall cost effectiveness of testing. Results of studies examining sensitivity, 
specificity, and agreement for IGRAs and TST vary with respect to which test is better. 
Although data on the accuracy of IGRAs and their ability to predict subsequent active 
tuberculosis are limited, to date, no major deficiencies have been reported in studies 
involving various populations. As use of these tests increases, greater understanding of 
their value and limitations will be gained. 
• 
An IGRA may be used in place of (but not in addition to) a TST in all situations in which CDC 
recommends tuberculin skin testing as an aid in diagnosing M. tuberculosis infection, with 
preferences and special considerations noted below. Despite the indication of a preference in 
these instances, use of the alternative test (FDA-approved IGRA or TST) is acceptable 
medical and public health practice. 
          421

Situations in Which an IGRA Is Preferred but a TST Is Acceptable 
• 
An IGRA is preferred for testing persons from groups that historically have low rates of 
returning to have TSTs read. For example, use of an IGRA might increase test completion 
rates for homeless persons and drug-users. The use of IGRAs for such persons can 
increase test completion rates, so control efforts can focus on those most likely to benefit 
from further evaluation and treatment. 
• 
An IGRA is preferred for testing persons who have received BCG (as a vaccine or for cancer 
therapy). Use of IGRAs in this population is expected to increase diagnostic specificity and 
improve acceptance of treatment for LTBI. 
 
Situations in Which a TST Is Preferred but an IGRA Is Acceptable 
• 
A TST is preferred for testing children aged <5 years. Use of an IGRA in conjunction with 
TST has been advocated by some experts to increase diagnostic sensitivity in this age 
group. Recommendations regarding use of IGRAs in children have also been published by 
the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
 
Situations in Which Either a TST or an IGRA May Be Used Without Preference 
• 
An IGRA or a TST may be used without preference to test recent contacts of persons known 
or suspected to have active tuberculosis with special considerations for follow-up testing. 
IGRAs offer the possibility of detecting M. tuberculosis infection with greater specificity than 
with a TST. Also, unlike TSTs, IGRAs do not boost subsequent test results and can be 
completed following a single patient visit. However, data on the ability of IGRAs to predict 
subsequent active tuberculosis are limited. If IGRAs are to be used in contact investigations, 
negative results obtained prior to 8 weeks after the end of exposure typically should be 
confirmed by repeat testing 8--10 weeks after the end of exposure. This recommendation is 
similar to one used for TST, because data on the timing of IGRA conversion after a new 
infection are not currently available. Use of the same test format for repeat testing will 
minimize the number of conversions that occur as a result of test differences. 
• 
An IGRA or a TST may be used without preference for periodic screening of persons who 
might have occupational exposure to M. tuberculosis (e.g., surveillance programs for health- 
care workers) with special considerations regarding conversions and reversions. For serial and 
periodic screening, IGRAs offer technical, logistic, and possible economic advantages 
compared with TSTs but also have potential disadvantages. Advantages include the ability to 
get results following a single visit. Two- step testing is not required for IGRAs, because IGRA 
testing does not boost subsequent test results. Disadvantages of IGRAs in this setting include 
a greater risk of test conversion due to false-positive IGRA results with follow-up testing of low- 
risk health-care workers who have tested negative at prior screening. CDC has published 
criteria for identifying conversions for TSTs and IGRAs. TST conversion is defined as a change 
n within 2 years. TST 
conversion is associated with an increased risk for active tuberculosis. An IGRA conversion is 
defined as a change from negative to positive within 2 years without any consideration of the 
magnitude of the change in TB Response. Using this lenient criterion to define IGRA 
conversion might produce more conversions than are observed with the more stringent criteria 
applied to TSTs. Furthermore, an association between an IGRA conversion and subsequent 
disease risk has not been demonstrated. The criteria for interpreting changes in an IGRA that 
identify new infections remain uncertain. CDC encourages institutions and programs in which 
IGRAs are used to publish their experiences, particularly in regard to rates of conversion, 
reversion, and progression to active tuberculosis over time.

Situations in Which Testing with Both an IGRA and a TST May Be Considered 
 
• 
Although routine testing with both a TST and an IGRA is not generally recommended, results 
from both tests might be useful when the initial test (TST or IGRA) is negative in the following 
situations: 
1) when the risk for infection, the risk for progression, and the risk for a poor outcome are 
increased (e.g., when persons with HIV infection or children aged <5 years are at increased 
risk for M. tuberculosis infection) or 2) when clinical suspicion exists for active tuberculosis 
(such as in persons with symptoms, signs, and/or radiographic evidence suggestive of active 
tuberculosis) and confirmation of M. tuberculosis infection is desired. In such patients with an 
initial test that is negative, taking a positive result from a second test as evidence of infection 
increases detection sensitivity. However, multiple negative results from any combination of 
these tests cannot exclude M. tuberculosis infection. 
• 
Using both a TST and an IGRA also might be useful when the initial test is positive in the 
following situations: 1) when additional evidence of infection is required to encourage 
compliance (e.g., in foreign-born health-care workers who believe their positive TST result is 
attributable to BCG) or 2) in healthy persons who have a low risk for both infection and 
progression. In the first situation, a positive IGRA might prompt greater acceptance of 
treatment for LTBI as compared with a positive TST alone. In the latter situation, requiring a 
positive result from the second test as evidence of infection increases the likelihood that the 
test result reflects infection. For the second situation, an alternative is to assume, without 
additional testing, that the initial result is a false positive or that the risk for disease does not 
warrant additional evaluation or treatment, regardless of test results. Steps should be taken to 
minimize unnecessary and misleading testing of persons at low risk. 
• 
Repeating an IGRA or performing a TST might be useful when the initial IGRA result is 
indeterminate, borderline, or invalid and a reason for testing persists. A second test also might 
be useful when assay measurements from the initial test are unusual, such as when the Nil 
value is higher than typical for the population being tested (e.g., IFN- 
N 
QFT-G or QFT-GIT 
>0.7 IU/mL for most of the U.S. populations), the Nil value is appreciably greater than the value 
obtained with M. tuberculosis antigen stimulation (e.g. when IFN- concentration for Nil by QFT- 
G is 
0.35 IU/mL greater than the concentration obtained with either ESAT-6 or CFP-10 stimulation, 
or when the number of spots for Nil by T-SPOT is four spots greater than the number with 
either ESAT- 6 or CFP-10 stimulation), or the Mitogen value is lower than is expected for the 
population being tested (e.g., the Mitogen Response by QFT-G or 
QFT-GIT is <0.5 IU/mL, or the number of spots in the mitogen well by T-SPOT is <20). If an 
IGRA is to be repeated, a new blood sample should be used. In such situations, repeat testing 
with another blood sample usually provides interpretable results. 
          423

Medical Management After 
Testing 
• 
Diagnoses of M. tuberculosis infection and decisions about medical or public health 
management should not be based on IGRA or TST results alone but should include 
consideration of epidemiologic and medical history as well as other clinical information. 
• 
Persons with a positive TST or IGRA result should be evaluated for the likelihood of M 
tuberculosis infection, for risks for progression to active tuberculosis if infected, and for 
symptoms and signs of active tuberculosis. If risks, symptoms, or signs are present, 
additional evaluation is indicated to determine if the person has LTBI or active tuberculosis. 
• 
A diagnosis of LTBI requires that active tuberculosis be excluded by medical evaluation, 
which should include taking a medical history and a physical examination to check for 
suggestive symptoms and signs, a chest radiograph, and, when indicated, testing of sputum 
or other clinical samples for the presence of M. tuberculosis. Neither an IGRA nor TST can 
distinguish LTBI from active tuberculosis. 
• 
In persons who have symptoms, signs, or radiographic evidence of active tuberculosis or 
who are at increased risk for progression to active tuberculosis if infected, a positive result 
with either an IGRA or TST should be taken as evidence of M. tuberculosis infection. 
However, negative IGRA or TST results are not sufficient to exclude infection in these 
persons, especially in those at increased risk for a poor outcome if disease develops, and 
clinical judgment dictates when and if further diagnostic evaluation and treatment are 
indicated. 
• 
In healthy persons who have a low likelihood both of M. tuberculosis infection and of 
progression to active tuberculosis if infected, a single positive IGRA or TST result should not 
be taken as reliable evidence of M. tuberculosis infection. Because of the low probability of 
infection, a false-positive result is more likely. In such situations, the likelihood of M. 
tuberculosis infection and of disease progression should be reassessed, and the initial test 
results should be confirmed. Repeat testing, with either the initial test or a different test, may 
be considered on a case-by-case basis. For such persons, an alternative is to assume, 
without additional testing, that the initial result is a false positive. 
• 
In persons with discordant test results (i.e., one positive and the other negative), decisions 
about medical or public health management require individualized judgment in assessing the 
quality and magnitude of each test result (e.g., size of induration and presence of blistering 
for a TST; and the TB Response, Nil, and Mitogen values for an IGRA), the probability of 
infection, the risk for disease if infected, and the risk for a poor outcome if disease occurs. 
• 
Taking a positive result from either of two tests as evidence of infection is reasonable when 1) 
clinical suspicion exists for active tuberculosis (e.g., in persons with symptoms, signs, and/or 
radiographic evidence of active tuberculosis) or 2) the risks for infection, progression, and a 
poor outcome are increased (e.g., when persons with HIV infection or children aged <5 years 
are at increased risk for M. tuberculosis infection). 
• 
For healthy persons who have a low risk for both infection and progression, discounting an 
isolated positive result as a false positive is reasonable. This will increase detection specificity 
and decrease unnecessary treatment. 
• 
For persons who have received BCG and who are not at increased risk for a poor outcome if 
infected (Box 2, below), TST reactions of <15 mm in size may reasonably be discounted as 
false positives when an IGRA is clearly negative. 
• 
In other situations, inadequate evidence exists on which to base recommendations for dealing 
with discordant results. However, in the absence of convincing evidence of infection, 
diagnostic decisions may reasonably be deferred unless an increased risk exists for 
progression if infected and/or a high risk exists for a poor outcome if disease develops.”

Evaluation of Immigrants and Refugees for 
Tuberculosis 
 
 
The Local Health Department Tuberculosis (TB) Coordinator or TB Nurse will assure that an 
immigrant and/or a refugee referred to the Kentucky TB Prevention and Control Program (KY TB 
Program) by the Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. Department of State (DOS) receives an 
evaluation for active TB disease. This process of completing the evaluation of an immigrant or a 
refugee is collaborative with roles for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Electronic 
Disease Notification (EDN) system, the KY TB Program, and the LDH TB staff. 
 
 
PROCEDURE FOR LHD TB STAFF: 
1. The LHD TB Coordinator or TB nurse must contact the immigrant or refugee designated as 
B1 or B2 within three working days of receiving the DOS documents (DS-2053: Medical 
Examination for Immigrant or Refugee Applicant; DS-3024: Chest X-ray and Classification 
Worksheet; DS-3025: Vaccination Documentation Worksheet; and DS-3026: Medical History 
and Physical Examination Worksheet) forwarded by the KY TB Program. 
2. Follow the instructions on the TB Class Follow-up Worksheet. 
3. A medical evaluation must be initiated within 30 days of the notification date for 
immigrants and refugees with abnormal chest x-rays overseas that were consistent with 
TB. 
4. A complete medical evaluation must be completed within 90 days of the notification date for 
immigrants and refugees with abnormal chest x-rays read overseas that were consistent with 
TB. 
5. All immigrants and refugees with abnormal chest x-rays read overseas consistent with TB and 
diagnosed with latent TB infection (LTBI) should be evaluated as per Section C, diagnosed as 
per Section D, and treated as per Section E on the TB Follow-up Worksheet (see below). 
6. All immigrants and refugees with abnormal chest x-rays read overseas consistent with TB, 
diagnosed with LTBI and started on treatment should complete LTBI treatment. 
7. All refugees from high-prevalence countries (see Appendix) must be evaluated for tuberculosis 
with the work- up described below. 
8. The LHD TB Coordinator or TB nurse must notify the KY TB Program if an immigrant and/or a 
refugee cannot be located within 14 working days of receipt of the DOS documents.

PROCEDURE 
 
1. Review the medical and contact information contained within the DOS documents to 
determine the immigrant or refugee’s demographics and TB classification. 
2. Notify the LHD by phone or fax of immigrant or refugee’s notification. 
3. Complete the demographic information in the CDC Electronic Disease Notification System 
and attach it to the DOS documents. 
 
 
LHD TB Coordinator or TB nurse will: 
 
1. 
Contact the refugee or immigrant, if they have been designated as TB Class B1 or B2, within 3 
days of receiving the forwarded DOS documents and request that the individual immediately 
contact the county health department to schedule an appointment for evaluation. This can be 
accomplished by the following methods: 
Step 1 – Make a telephone call within 24 hours of receipt of documents. 
Step 2 – Send a letter within 7 working days if no response to phone call. 
Step 3 – Make a home visit within 10 working days if no response to call or letter. 
2. 
Conduct an assessment work-up: 
• Assess for signs and symptoms of TB using the TB Risk Assessment. 
• Repeat tuberculin skin test (TST) and/or administer a tuberculin skin test (TST) 
or perform a blood assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (BAMT). 
• Obtain a chest x-ray (CXR) or repeat the CXR if the previous CXR was obtained 
outside of the United States. 
3. 
Assure that a diagnostic work-up is completed by the TB Medical Clinician to determine if 
treatment for LTBI or active TB disease is indicated. Forward all completed TB Follow-up 
worksheets to the KY TB Program within 90 days.

Vital Signs 
Vital signs are measurements of the body’s most basic functions. The 4 main vital signs routinely 
checked by LHD providers include: Body temperature, pulse rate, breathing rate (respirations) and blood 
pressure. Vital signs help detect or monitor medical problems. 
Body Temperature 
The normal body temperature of a patient can range from 97.8° F (36.5°C) to 99°F (37.2°C) for a 
healthy adult. A person's body temperature can be taken in any of the following ways: 
• 
Orally. Temperature can be taken by mouth using a digital thermometer that uses an electronic 
probe to measure body temperature. 
• 
Rectally. Temperatures taken rectally tend to be 0.5°F to 0.7°F higher than when taken by 
mouth. This is more common in babies because their body doesn't regulate temperature the way 
an older child or adult's body does. 
• 
Armpit (axillary). Temperatures can be taken under the arm using a digital thermometer. 
Temperatures taken by this route tend to be 0.3°F to 0.4°F lower than those temperatures taken 
by mouth. 
• 
By ear (tympanic). A special thermometer can quickly measure the temperature of the eardrum, 
which reflects the body's core temperature (the temperature of the internal organs). 
• 
By skin. A special thermometer can quickly measure the temperature of the skin on the 
forehead. Some thermometers don't require contact with the skin to get a temperature reading. 
 
Age 
Temperature 
Management 
Birth to 10 years 
• 
Temperature between 99.8–100.8 F 
is considered low-grade fever. If the 
temperature is taken rectally, a 
temperature is not considered a 
fever until it is above 100.4 
• 
Temperature between 101–102 is 
considered a mild fever. 
• 
Temperature between 102–103 is 
considered a moderate fever. 
• 
Temperature around 104 or above 
is considered a high fever, and 
delirium or convulsions may occur. 
Assess the patient to determine 
if other signs or symptoms are 
present (i.e., flushed face, hot, 
dry skin, low output and highly 
concentrated urine, disinterest in 
eating, constipation, diarrhea, or 
vomiting. Older children or 
adolescents may complain of 
sore throat, headaches, aching 
all over, nausea, constipation, or 
diarrhea). 
Determine if elevated 
temperature could be post 
immunization (see Immunization 
Section), or related to underlying 
condition, being treated at the 
LHD. If not, seek medical 
consultation and/or refer for 
medical evaluation. 
Fever in an infant 3 months and 
younger is of greater 
significance and medical 
consultation or referral should 
occur. 
11 years to Adult 
• 
Temperature above 100.4 is 
considered a fever. 
• 
If temperature is taken rectally, it 
would register one degree higher 
and a reading of 101 would be 
considered a fever. 
• 
Temperature between 101–102 is 
considered a mild fever. 
• 
Temperature between 102–103 is 
considered a high fever, and 
delirium or convulsions may occur.

Pulse 
The normal pulse for healthy adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute. The pulse rate may fluctuate 
and increase with exercise, illness, injury, and emotions. The pulse rate is a measurement of the heart 
rate. This is the number of times the heart beats per minute. As the heart pushes blood through the 
arteries, the arteries expand and contract with the flow of the blood. Taking a pulse not only measures the 
heart rate, but also can indicate the heart rhythm and strength. 
 
Age 
Pulse 
Management 
Newborn 
100-170 
The apical heart rate is preferred in children. 
To count the rate, place stethoscope on the 
anterior chest at the fifth intercostal space in 
a midclavicular position. Each “lub-dub” 
sound is one beat. Count the beats 
for one full minute. While counting the rate, 
note whether the rhythm is regular or 
irregular. 
Pulse rates may be checked at sites other 
than the apex, for example, the carotid, 
brachial, radial, femoral, and dorsalis pedis 
sites. Compare the distal and proximal 
pulses for strength. Also, record whether the 
pulse is normal, bounding (very strong), or 
thready (weak). 
When reviewing the resting heart or pulse 
rate in each of the age groups, if the rate is 
not within the normal limits: 
• Repeat to confirm. 
• Review history for appropriate age group 
to determine if patient is taking medication 
that may alter the heart rate or if the patient 
is active in sports or exercise programs (i.e., 
runner, jogger, football, basketball, tennis, 
etc.). 
• If heart or pulse rate is outside the normal 
range and there is no appropriate rationale, 
refer for medical evaluation.

Respirations 
The respiration rate is the number of breaths you take each minute. The rate is usually measured when 
you are at rest. It simply involves counting the number of breaths for one minute by counting how many 
times your chest rises. Respiration rates may increase with exercise, fever, illness, and with other medical 
conditions. Normal respiration rates for an adult person at rest range from 12 to 20 breaths per 
minute.

Respirations 
Management

The procedure for measuring a 
child’s respiratory rate is 
essentially the same as for an 
adult. However, keep in mind 
these points. 
• 
Since a child’s 
respiration rate is 
diaphragmatic observe 
abdominalmovement to 
count the respiration 
rate. 
• 
Abdominal movement in 
a child will be irregular. 
• 
Count for one full 
minute. 
Assess the patient to determine 
if other signs or symptoms of 
respiratory or cardiac distress 
are present. If a child has any 
acute distress (retractions, 
cyanosis, wheezing, 
irritability),refer immediately for a 
medical evaluation.

Blood Pressure 
Blood pressure is the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls during contraction and relaxation 
of the heart. Two numbers are recorded when measuring blood pressure. The higher number is called 
systolic pressure. It refers to the pressure inside the artery when the heart contracts and pumps blood 
through the body. The lower number is called diastolic pressure. It refers to the pressure inside the artery 
when the heart is at rest and is filling with blood. Both pressures are recorded as "mm Hg" (millimeters of 
mercury). Blood pressure measurement for a child is basically the same as for an adult. The size of the 
blood pressure cuff is extremely important. The size of the blood pressure cuff is determined by the 
size of the patient’s arm or leg. Generally, the width of the bladder cuff is two thirds of the length of the 
long bone of the extremity on which the blood pressure is taken. The length of the bladder cuff should be 
about three-fourths the circumference of the extremity and should not overlap.
